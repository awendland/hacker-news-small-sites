						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Overfitting is an important concept all data professionals need to deal with sooner or later, especially if you are tasked with building models. A good understanding of this phenomenon will let you identify it and fix it, helping you create better models and solutions.</p>
<p>In brief, overfitting happens when your models fail to learn only the most important general patterns hidden within your data. A very powerful model can learn even the patterns that exist <strong>only</strong> in your training set. When these models are used on real data, their results are usually sub-optimal, so it's important to detect overfitting during training and take action as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss how to spot and fix overfitting issues.</p>
<h2 id="ifyoulookhardenoughyouwillfindpatterns">If you look hard enough, you will find patterns</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We will discuss overfitting in the context of supervised learning, which is the most common scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might remember, in supervised learning you use training data to teach a model how to do something. Some of the most common tasks are regression and classification, which we discussed in a previous article.</p>
<p>Also, you might remember that we set aside two other important datasets before the training step: the validation and training sets. This data will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.</p>
<p>You use the training alongside different algorithms to create models in the hopes of finding specific trends or patterns that <strong>generalize</strong> well on real data. If the model fails to find enough useful patterns, it won't have enough predictive power to be useful in practice. A model that fails to capture the underlying patterns and structure of the data is said to be <strong>underfitting</strong>.</p>
<p>You can solve this problem by increasing the complexity of the model or finding more meaningful data. More powerful models can find subtler patterns in data, and for many problems, this is necessary to avoid overfitting. The main problem is that the training set can have specific quirks or patterns that don't exist in real-world examples of your problem.</p>
<p>A model that looks for patterns in a very aggressive fashion can end up learning these quirks and reduce their performance on real examples. When models learn too many of these patterns, they are said to be <strong>overfitting</strong>. An overfitting model performs very well on the data used to train it but performs poorly on data it hasn't seen before.</p>
<p>The process of training a model is about striking a balance between underfitting and overfitting. Because models can't differentiate between patterns that only exist in the training set and patterns that generalize well, it's your responsibility to regulate the learning process. If you use a very weak model you risk underfitting, but if you use a very powerful one you can overfit.</p>
<h2 id="areallifeexamplepresidentialelections">A real life example: presidential elections</h2>
<p>One of my favorite examples for illustrating the idea of overfitting is the following comic made by Randall Munroe:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2020/01/xkcd_overfitting.png" alt="xkcd_overfitting"></p>
<p>This comic represents a series of patterns in presidential elections that were true but didn't provide any meaningful predictive power for the task of predicting the next U.S president.</p>
<p>A predictive model that takes into consideration these patterns would perform poorly. The model would believe they represent significant trends and learn to spot them for making predictions. Things like <strong>No one with two middle names have become president</strong> are true in the dataset, but have little or no relation with the real problem being solved.</p>
<p>A real-world dataset can have similar quirks or patterns due to lots of reasons. It's important to understand that the fact that patterns exist doesn't mean they provide meaningful information for our tasks. An algorithm can't make this distinction by itself, so it's up to us to help them find the patterns that generalize well.</p>
<p>Ideally, your model would only learn meaningful patterns that let you predict or classify instances it hasn't seen before.</p>
<p>So, in practice, how can we spot overfitting?</p>
<h2 id="findingoutifyourmodeloverfits">Finding out if your model overfits</h2>
<p>A model that overfits performs very well on the data it's been trained with, but worse on data it hasn't seen before. The best way of finding out if your model is overfitting is by evaluating its performance on both the training and validation sets. This is much easier to see with an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2020/01/overfitting.png" alt="overfitting"></p>
<p>The previous graph represents the accuracy results of an image classifier built with Keras. On the X-axis you see the number of epochs (training cycles) and on the Y-axis the accuracy of the classifier.</p>
<p>After every epoch, the classifier learns deeper patterns in the data. You can notice an interesting tendency:</p>
<ul>
<li>As more epochs pass, the performance on the training set improves. This happens because the classifier learns more intricacies of the training set and can perform better predictions.</li>
<li>As more epochs pass, the classifier performs better on the validation set. This happens because it learns general patterns that apply well to data it hasn't seen yet. After a specific point (around 20 epochs), the performance on the validation set ceases to improve. This is the result of learning to reproduce idiosyncrasies in the training set that don't generalize well. After this point, we see that the model is <strong>overfitting</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to find out if your model is overfitting is by measuring its performance on your training and validation sets. If your model performs much better with training data than with validation data, you are overfitting.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to spot overfitting, let's talk about how to fix it.</p>
<h2 id="dealingwithoverfitting">Dealing with overfitting</h2>
<p>There are several ways of dealing with overfitting. Which technique is more effective depends on your task, data, and algorithms, but that doesn't mean you can apply only one of them.</p>
<p>All the techniques used to reduce overfitting are centered around a single idea: increase the influence of patterns that generalize well and reduce the influence of less meaningful patterns. Let's explore 4 of the most common ways of achieving this:</p>
<h4 id="1getmoredata">1. Get more data</h4>
<p>Getting more data is usually one of the most effective ways of fighting overfitting. Having more quality data reduces the influence of quirky patterns in your training set, and puts it closer to the distribution of the data in the real worlds.</p>
<p>Sometimes, finding data is not easy, so you need to see it as an investment, as you might need to spend time and money to get it. In this sense, it's better to see data as an asset, and not as a natural resource you can just grab.</p>
<h4 id="2regularization">2. Regularization</h4>
<p>Regularization is a set of techniques used to reduce the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. These techniques usually shrink the hypothesis space of the model by reducing its complexity, ensuring that it learns mostly general patterns.</p>
<p>The techniques are usually model specific. For example, in a tree-like model, you would reduce the depth of the tree or the total number of leaves. In neural networks, you can reduce the number of trainable weights or layers, or insert dropout layers at different parts of the network.</p>
<p>Another way of applying regularization is by training different models of varying complexities and comparing their performance and how strongly they overfit.</p>
<h4 id="3earlystopping">3. Early stopping</h4>
<p>Stopping the learning process halfway can ensure the model learns just enough information about the training set to perform well but not overfit.</p>
<p>In the previous Keras classifier example, we see how our network starts to overfit after around 20 epochs.</p>
<p>A way to ensure the network doesn't overfit is to stop the training when we reach the number of epochs when the network overfits. This is a simple (yet effective) solution for overfitting, and it applies to other algorithms.</p>
<h4 id="4ensemblemodels">4. Ensemble models</h4>
<p>Ensemble models are collections of smaller models whose results are averaged for making predictions. They are very good at resisting overfitting, as they distribute errors among sub-models of different complexities.</p>
<p>You can think of ensembles as groups of experts whose opinion you average for reaching a general consensus. This is one of the reasons ensemble models gained lots of popularity in the last years.</p>
<p>Random Forest (and its variants) is one of the most popular forms of ensemble models, and it's widely applied to lots of different problems with usually very good results.</p>
<p>There are lots of other techniques you can use, but these four represent the most common ways of dealing with overfitting. The best way of learning how to use these techniques is by applying them on real projects using your favorite ML libraries and tools.</p>
<h2 id="whatyouneedtorememberaboutoverfitting">What you need to remember about overfitting</h2>
<p>Overfitting is an extremely important topic for any professional data scientist or machine learning engineer, but it can be a bit daunting in the beginning. This is a summary of the most important ideas you need to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns exist in your training dataset. Some of these patterns represent real tendencies in the problem space, while others are just quirks of your training set. Failing to learn meaningful patterns results in underfitting, and learning too many of the quirky patterns results in overfitting. Both scenarios lead to models that perform poorly on real data.</li>
<li>Training a model is about balancing two competing forces: underfitting and overfitting. You want to learn patterns from your training set, but only the ones that generalize well. The dividing line is impossible to calculate theoretically, so lots of experimentation is needed to find the right compromise.</li>
<li>You can easily spot overfitting by comparing the performance metrics of running your model when against the validation set and the training set. A model that performs much better on the training data than on the validation data is overfitting.</li>
<li>There are lots of techniques used for dealing with overfitting. Usually, you increase the amount of data available or reduce the models learning power. A model that looks too hard for patterns is likely to end up learning unimportant quirks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you keep these things in mind when training your …</p></div></div>

<p><em>This is the fourth of a 5-part series on AWS exploits and similar findings discovered over the course of 2020. All findings discussed in this series have been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">disclosed</a> to the AWS security team and had patches rolled out to all affected regions, where necessary. A big thanks to my friend and fellow Australian <a href="https://twitter.com/__steele">Aidan Steele</a> for co-authoring this series with me. This post was written by Aidan.</em></p>

<p>Back in November 2019, AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/now-extend-aws-cloudformation-to-model-provision-and-manage-third-party-resources/">added support</a> for “resource providers” - a new and improved way of extending CloudFormation with user-authored resources. Not just that, it is also the way that all new resources are added to CloudFormation by AWS themselves. This was a substantial improvement over “custom resources”, which hadn’t seen any change since at least 2013 other than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/04/aws-cloudformation-supports-aws-lambda-backed-custom-resources/">Lambda support in 2015</a>. This post won’t get into the differences or benefits of resource providers, for that check out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/managing-resources-using-aws-cloudformation-resource-types/">this AWS blog post</a>.</p>

<p>On January 17th, <a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe">Ben Kehoe</a> CloudFormation extraordinaire sent me a Twitter DM with a link to a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-python-plugin/pull/71">pull request</a> that set off his spidey-senses. I was excited to receive this because a) Ben thought of me! and b) it combined CloudFormation and credentials in the cloud in a novel way, two of my favourite things. This was the excuse I needed to finally dig into resource providers - albeit not until the 21st when I had some time.</p>

<h2 id="pulling-things-apart">Pulling things apart</h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed is that (unlike custom resources) the Lambda function you are authoring ends up not running in your AWS account - it runs in an AWS-managed account. I was immediately curious about what permissions <strong>my</strong> code had in <strong>their</strong> account - you’d hope it’s locked down! I was also curious about how the code I wrote appeared to have a role in my account - where was the role being assumed?</p>

<p>Rather than try to understand the framework provided by CloudFormation and how things are <strong>meant</strong> to work, I decided to drop down a level and log the raw input to the Lambda function, to see how things <strong>actually</strong> work. This is an excerpt of the input passed to the Lambda when a resource is being created:</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So there are at least <strong>four</strong> different sets of credentials in play here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>callerCredentials</code>: These are the credentials that I am expected to use. They are for the role assumed in <strong>my</strong> account to actually create, update, delete, etc the resource in question.</li>
  <li>The <code>providerCredentials</code>: These are the credentials for the <code>LogAndMetricsDeliveryRole</code> role in the <code>CloudFormationManagedUploadInfrastructure</code> stack, i.e. for writing logs that appear in <strong>my</strong> account.</li>
  <li>The (not pictured) Lambda execution role’s credentials: this appears to have permission only to write logs within the AWS-managed account.</li>
  <li>The <code>platformCredentials</code>: These are the interesting ones. They are for a role in the AWS-managed account. That role has permission to call a handful of permissions, but the ones that caught my eye were <code>events:PutRule</code>, <code>events:PutTarget</code>, <code>events:RemoveTarget</code>, <code>events:DeleteRule</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does the Lambda function need permission to invoke those EventBridge APIs? Resource creation might take a long time and Lambda is limited to 15 minutes, so the service has support for reinvoking the Lambda periodically to ask “is it done yet?” and EventBridge cron jobs are a great fit for this. The way it works is by creating a one-off rule scheduled to run one minute in the future, with a target of the same Lambda. It specifies that the Lambda should be reinvoked with a hardcoded input string - namely the input that <strong>this</strong> invocation of the Lambda received.</p>

<h2 id="curiosity-intensifies">Curiosity intensifies</h2>

<p>This piqued my curiosity. What if I used the API to trigger a different target, like a Lambda in my account? No luck, they must have used the <code>events:TargetArn</code> condition key to restrict the target to only this Lambda. So I tried something else: what if instead I tried a different rule? I tried to create a rule that would invoke my Lambda in their account that matched events with <code>{"detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"]}</code>. I was immediately inundated with a firehose of events. I rushed to turn it off as it wasn’t my intention to break things, just curiosity.</p>

<p>I looked at the events. Was this really a security issue or more a “that’s cute” kind of thing? Most events were uninteresting. But one caught my eye. It was a call to <code>events:PutTarget</code>. The CloudTrail event included the payload. I’ve highlighted the noteworthy part.</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In order to reinvoke the function a minute later with the same payload, we established earlier that the target was created with a constant JSON input. That input includes credentials for a role in the customer’s account. Multiple (all?) customers are serviced by the AWS-managed account. So I could see credentials for other AWS customers using resource providers. They might be using it without realising: AWS are using this pattern for first-party types - I saw <code>AWS::WAFv2::RuleGroup</code> fly by in the logs.</p>



<p>That afternoon I reported the issue to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">AWS security team</a>. They got back to me within 9 hours. They asked for some clarification (fair, I was a bit frazzled when I wrote the first email!) and any reproduction steps I could provide. Given I’d slapped together a very manual proof-of-concept, I set about creating a more useful reproduction for them.</p>

<p>The CloudFormation service team also reached out to me. They indicated that they had actually already caught this internally and a fix was underway. A few days later on January 25th, they told me that a fix had been deployed to a couple of regions and asked if I could try again. A few minutes later, I got a follow up from the AWS security team with the same request - things move surprisingly quickly at AWS!</p>

<p>I tried again. After creating my rule I got a few events, but it quickly dried up without me even needing to turn it off. I looked through the events recorded. I didn’t see any of those problematic ones before, no matter how many times I tried. I did see this interesting one though:</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Clever! They had created an alarm that would trigger whenever a malicious rule was created. This was a solid tactical mitigation. Unfortunately the IAM policy conditions available on <code>events:PutRule</code> weren’t rich enough to block me outright, but this stopped the bleeding. I also noticed the unusual absence of any of the <code>events:PutTarget</code> API call events. I don’t know how they did this as omitting those from CloudTrail/EventBridge isn’t possible for customers’ accounts. I guess AWS have some secret sauce.</p>

<h2 id="closing-out">Closing out</h2>

<p>On January 31st I got a follow up email from AWS Security letting me know that the issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>On June 30th the CloudFormation team released version 2 of the resource provider protocol. It came with a number of benefits, but the change most visible to me was that the <code>platformCredentials</code> field had disappeared. It is no longer necessary as CloudFormation itself handles the reinvocation of the Lambda function.</p>

<p>Finally, on August 26th AWS sent out the following email, gently encouraging people to migrate to the new protocol for resource providers. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was followed by an eventual deprecation of v1.</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/security-september-5.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank Ben Kehoe for pointing this out to me in the first place. Without his keen eye and intuition for sensible security, I would have never noticed this. I’d like to thank Ian for being a great sounding board throughout the process. His <a href="https://twitter.com/iann0036/status/1161871038336028672">tweets</a> last year about Lake Formation issues made me feel confident that AWS would respond positively to my email. I’d also like to thank the AWS Security team who made me feel very comfortable both reporting my first issue and that it was being addressed in a thorough and impressively timely fashion. And a second thanks to Ian for motivating me to write my first blog posts in years!</p>

					Before autonomous vehicles participate in road traffic, they must demonstrate conclusively that they do not pose a danger to others. New software developed at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) prevents accidents by predicting different variants of a traffic situation every millisecond.
				</p></header><section><p>A car approaches an intersection. Another vehicle jets out of the cross street, but it is not yet clear whether it will turn right or left. At the same time, a pedestrian steps into the lane directly in front of the car, and there is a cyclist on the other side of the street. People with road traffic experience will in general assess the movements of other traffic participants correctly.</p><p>“These kinds of situations present an enormous challenge for autonomous vehicles controlled by computer programs,” explains <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/althoff-matthias" target="_blank">Matthias Althoff</a>, Professor of Cyber-Physical Systems at TUM. "But autonomous driving will only gain acceptance of the general public if you can ensure that the vehicles will not endanger other road users – no matter how confusing the traffic situation."</p><div id="c58839"><div><div><p>The ultimate goal when developing software for autonomous vehicles is to ensure that they will not cause accidents. Althoff, who is a member of the <a href="https://www.msrm.tum.de/en/home/" target="_blank">Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence</a> at TUM, and his team have now developed a software module that permanently analyzes and predicts events while driving. Vehicle sensor data are recorded and evaluated every millisecond. The software can calculate all possible movements for every traffic participant – provided they adhere to the road traffic regulations – allowing the system to look three to six seconds into the future.</p><p>Based on these future scenarios, the system determines a variety of movement options for the vehicle. At the same time, the program calculates potential emergency maneuvers in which the vehicle can be moved out of harm’s way by accelerating or braking without endangering others. The autonomous vehicle may only follow routes that are free of foreseeable collisions and for which an emergency maneuver option has been identified.</p></div></div></div><div id="c58840"><div><div><p>This kind of detailed traffic situation forecasting was previously considered too time-consuming and thus impractical. But now, the Munich research team has shown not only the theoretical viability of real-time data analysis with simultaneous simulation of future traffic events: They have also demonstrated that it delivers reliable results.</p><p>The quick calculations are made possible by simplified dynamic models. So-called reachability analysis is used to calculate potential future positions a car or a pedestrian might assume. When all characteristics of the road users are taken into account, the calculations become prohibitively time-consuming. That is why Althoff and his team work with simplified models. These are superior to the real ones in terms of their range of motion – yet, mathematically easier to handle. This enhanced freedom of movement allows the models to depict a larger number of possible positions but includes the subset of positions expected for actual road users.</p></div></div></div><div id="c58841"><div><div><p>For their evaluation, the computer scientists created a virtual model based on real data they had collected during test drives with an autonomous vehicle in Munich. This allowed them to craft a test environment that closely reflects everyday traffic scenarios. "Using the simulations, we were able to establish that the safety module does not lead to any loss of performance in terms of driving behavior, the predictive calculations are correct, accidents are prevented, and in emergency situations the vehicle is demonstrably brought to a safe stop," Althoff sums up.</p><p>The computer scientist emphasizes that the new security software could simplify the development of autonomous vehicles because it can be combined with all standard motion control programs.</p></div></div></div><div><h3>

September 22, 2020 | https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/morgenstern.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/morgenstern.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by Jeffrey Kegler</p>
    <p>The story of Gödel's citizenship hearing had been much repeated over the years.
      What was known was that on 5 December 1947, Kurt Gödel went to his citizenship hearing in Trenton, New Jersey.
      The examiner was Judge Philip Forman.
      As his witnesses, Gödel brought his two closest friends, Oskar Morgenstern and Albert Einstein.
      Gödel was granted citizenship, and took his oath on 2 April 1948.
      Those were the reliably established facts.
    </p>
    <p>Afterwards, Morgenstern told many people that he and Einstein had had their hands full preventing the brilliant, but politically naive, Gödel from derailing his citizenship chances.
      No account directly from Morgenstern or anyone else at the hearing had survived, but hearsay versions circulated widely.
      The hearsay versions show considerable variation, but their burden is something like the following:
    </p>
    <p>Gödel, in his usual manner, had read extensively in preparing for the hearing.
      In the course of his studies, Gödel decided that he had discovered a flaw in the U.S. Constitution --
      a contradiction which would allow the U.S. to be turned into a dictatorship.
      Gödel, usually quite reticent, seemed to feel a need to make this known.
      Morgenstern and Einstein warned Gödel that it would be a disaster to confront his citizenship examiner with visions of a Constitutional flaw leading to an American dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving in Princeton, the trio had no idea who the examiner would be.
      They happened to run into Judge Forman.
      Forman was a friend of Einstein's --
      when Einstein became a citizen, Forman had administered the oath.
      How lucky this was became apparent almost immediately during the questioning.
      Forman happened to remark how fortunate it was that the US was not a dictatorship, which Gödel took as a cue to explain his discovery.
      A surprised Forman exchanged glances with Einstein and Morgenstern, cut Gödel off, and forced-marched the hearing through to a successful conclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>The History, and the Legend</h2>
    <p>Nobody seems to know what Gödel's proof was.
      Many versions of the hearing that circulated featured invented dialog.
      In faculty room yarns this would be unfortunate, but not surprising.
      More startling is the presence of such dialog in the version given
      in the extremely scholarly and very carefully edited Gödel's
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>, Vol. I, p. 12.
      A footnote in
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>
      admits that its version is pure hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned to distrust such sources.
      When I was in graduate school, studying Theory of Computation, Kurt Gödel was still alive.
      I heard many tales of Gödel's eccentric behavior from mathematicians.
      Gödel certainly was eccentric, and first-hand tales of this abound,
      but I later discovered that every single anecdote I'd gotten second- or third-hand was almost certainly false.
    </p>
    <p>1997 marked a turning point in Gödel biography,
      with the publication of John Dawson's careful and reliable biography of Gödel:
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>.
      When Dawson wrote, all four participants in the hearing were dead.
      Morgenstern refers, briefly and cryptically, to the hearing in his diary, but does not say enough to fully support the story.
      Dawson in general, and quite correctly, rejected the use of hearsay.
      But this story was the most well-known story about Gödel, and nobody doubted that it had a basis in truth.
    </p>
    <p>Dawson apparently decided that some reference to this story must be made, regardless of sourcing difficulty.
      Given no alternative to using hearsay, Dawson was careful to seek out what could reasonably be thought of as the
      source of the best hearsay -- Morgenstern's widow.
      She certainly would have heard the story many times, and directly from Morgenstern.
      Dawson interviewed her on 17 October 1983.
      Dawson's account in
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>
      (pp. 179-180) is based on that interview and Morgenstern's diary entry.
    </p>
    <h2>The Lost Document</h2>
    <p>According to Dawson (p. 300), Morgenstern had written up an account of this matter for publication, but Dawson was unable to locate it.
      Dorothy Morgenstern was sure that she'd once had her husband's write-up,
      and that she'd sent it to someone.
      But she could not remember who.
      This wasn't exactly promising for the accuracy of her retelling.
      But best evidence is best evidence -- you take it how it comes.
    </p>
    <p>In dealing with the matter as a Wikipedia editor,
      I took the position that Dawson's account of this hearing was the final word.
      The other versions were either retellings of the Dawson account,
      hearsay from less reliable sources or pure speculation.
      Regardless of which of the three they were, they were to be rejected as sources for the Wikipedia article.
    </p>
    <p>When dealing with the matter as a novelist, the God Proof,
      I took the position that this story had become a legend as much as any tale of an 11th century saint.
      Since it was a legend, I was free as a writer of fiction to add any incident or dialog I thought to be in the spirit of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>But now the "lost" Morgenstern document has reappeared.
      Apparently the IAS has had it all these years.

          PDF of original Morgenstern document on the Gödel citizenship hearing</a>:
        Morgenstern says that he did not check dates, and that corrected ones would be needed.
        The dates are, indeed, wrong.
        The ones above are from Dawson and presumably correct.
        The "Examinor" (sic) referred to is Judge Forman.
        Morgenstern was not a native English speaker, and this often shows in his wording and spelling.

problemfreiÂ», heisst es auf der Internetseite des schweizerischen AussenÂ­ministeriums EDA.</p><p>Das ist ziemlich geschwurbelt. Denn zwischen den beiden Staaten herrscht gerade dicke Luft.</p><p>Am 15. Oktober hÃ¤tte in Stockholm ein feierliches Dinner stattfinden sollen. Zu den hochkarÃ¤tigen GÃ¤sten hÃ¤tten Bundesrat Ignazio Cassis (59) und seine schwedische Amtskollegin Ann Linde (58) gehÃ¶rt. Â­Anlass ist das 100-Jahr-Â­JubilÃ¤um der diplomatischen Â­Beziehungen zwischen der Eidgenossenschaft und dem KÃ¶nigreich; die Schweiz hat seit 1920 in Stockholm eine Â­eigene Gesandtschaft.</p><p>Doch daraus wird nichts. Das schwedische Aussenministerium hat den Termin diese Woche Â­platzen lassen. Eine befreundete Regierung derart vor den Kopf zu stossen, ist ein hÃ¶chst unÃ¼bÂ­liches ManÃ¶ver.</p><p>Den Grund fÃ¼r den diplomaÂ­tischen Eklat lieferte Ann Lindes Ministerium gleich mit: Die AbÂ­sage an Cassis wird explizit mit dem Verweis auf einen Entscheid des Bundesrats in der Crypto-Â­ AffÃ¤re begrÃ¼ndet, wie gut informierte Quellen gegenÃ¼ber SonntagsBlick Â­berichten.</p><p><h3>Tradition der NeutralitÃ¤tspolitik</h3></p><p>Im Juni hatte die LandesÂ­regierung entschieden, dass die Firma Crypto International AG im zugerischen Steinhausen keine ChiffriergerÃ¤te mehr exportieren darf.

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-22</p>
        
<p>What do I mean by using exceptions as a control flow mechanism?</p>
<h2>I - Exceptions as control flow mechanism</h2>
<p>The gist of it is replacing something like:</p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(a, duck):
    a.quack()
else:
    bar()
</code></pre>
<p>With something like:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    a.quack()
except:
    bar()
</code></pre>
<p>Writing control flows using an if/switch/etc involves thinking about something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unde what conditions should I perform this operation and what should I do if those conditions aren't true?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing control flows using exception switched that paradigm to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this operation fails, what should I try instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>An example that I encountered in the real world:</p>
<p>As part of a data cleaning script, I had to determine if a float different from <code>NaN</code> in python. But really, what I wanted to ask was: "Can I use this variable of type float/np.float/whatever in basic numerical operations without raising exceptions or running into undefined behavior ?".</p>
<p>The obvious way to do that is something like: <code>math.isnan(number)</code>, right?</p>
<p>Well, technically correct, as long as your definition of <code>NaN</code> is the same as the one python has. But under my definition, this will fail in cases like the following: <code>np.isnan(float('inf'))</code>.</p>
<p>So I have to write a function like:</p>
<pre><code>def is_invalid_float(nr):
    if np.isnan(nr):
    	return True
    elif np.isinf(nr):
    	return True
    else:
    	return False
</code></pre>
<p>This has some disadvantages:</p>
<p>a) I have to know about the fact that a floating-point variable can be both <code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>.</p>
<p>b) I may still be missing some edge cases in which a float typed variable can lead to UB or exception throwing in numeric operations.</p>
<p>c) It's a somewhat complex function, instead of a one-liner calling an external function.</p>
<p>The exception-based version looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>def is_invalid_float(nr):
    try:
    	int(nr)
    	return False
    except:
    	return True
</code></pre>
<p>Much better, right?</p>
<p>Well, arguably. Going through my complaints above:</p>
<p>a) I have to know about the fact that a floating-point variable can be both <code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>. -- I don't have to know this, if I implemented my <code>nan</code> check like this to being with, I would have been safe and sound never knowing about <code>inf</code>.</p>
<p>b) I may still be missing some edge cases in which a float typed variable can lead to UB or exception throwing in numeric operations. -- Well, I might still be missing some edge cases, but there's a higher chance I won't be, since I can assume other "strange" things that may be of type <code>float</code> respect the rule 'if it's a non-numeric floating-point typed variable I can't make an integer out of it".</p>
<p>c) It's still a somewhat complex function. Shorter, but it's less obvious what kind of values (<code>nan</code> and <code>inf</code>) caused the need for this check.</p>
<p>More importantly, I'm losing potentially valid floats that can't be converted to integers for some other reasons.</p>
<p><em>Note: as far as I know there are no other "edge cases" for floating-point numbers in python other than nan and inf and any other floating-point numbers will be int-convertible on an x86 CPython RE. This is an example for illustrative purposes</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ok, let's look at a stronger example:</p>
<p>Let's say I have a string and I need to check it's a read-only MariaDB query, something that only selects data rather than inserting, modifying, or deleting it.</p>
<p>Well, I can use an external SQL parser to tell me if the query is valid and contains mutable keywords or I can try to check for them myself, or I can:</p>
<pre><code>def is_read_only_query():
    with  new_connection() as conn:
    	try:
    		conn.execute('SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY')
    		conn.execute(query_string)
    		return True
    	except:
    		return False
</code></pre>
<p>Is this a bullet-proof solution?</p>
<p>I don't know, I wouldn't use it to prevent a SQL injection from a skilled and malicious actor. But it can avoid a <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">"Robert); DROP TABLE Students;"</a> kind of scenario and it can certainly avoid a mistake by a clumsy database operator with the best of intentions but a habit of too readily copy-pasting stuff from stack overflow.</p>
<hr>
<p>What I'm saying here is not revolutionary, at least not for certain languages, catching an exception is often the recommended way to check if an object can be cast to a different type in python.</p>
<p>I think where people would get a bit more itchy is when seeing something like:</p>
<pre><code>def determine_type(text):
    try:
    	sum(list(text))
    	return 'list of numbers'
    except:
    	try:
    		int(text)
    		return 'int'
    	except:
    		try:
    			float(text)
    			return 'float'
    		except:
    			return 'other'
</code></pre>
<p>To me, the above code looks like the "correct" way to check if <code>text</code> is a list of numbers, integer, float, or a string representing something else.</p>
<p>But I can understand the reluctance to use these kinds of control flows. They are really ugly in terms of brackets or indentation, so getting past 6 or 7 layers of this can get unreadable. There is no easy workaround for this in dialects that people are familiar with.</p>
<p>But, what if we keep it short and sweet? What's the disadvantage of exception-based control flow?</p>
<h2>II - Stack Overflow on why it's bad</h2>
<p>I'm curious what the answer is if I google "Exceptions as control flow". I tried a few queries, this one returned varied results which bought up good points, so I stuck with it, but this is not an exhaustive list of arguments against the practice.</p>
<p>First, let's look at some of the most upvoted answers (in order of votes) on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729379/why-not-use-exceptions-as-regular-flow-of-control">the Stack Overflow question on</a> the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever tried to debug a program raising five exceptions per second in the normal course of operation ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The program was quite complex (it was a distributed calculation server), and a slight modification at one side of the program could easily break something in a completely different place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could just have launched the program and wait for exceptions to occur, but there were around 200 exceptions during the start-up <em>in the normal course of operations</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My point: <strong>if you use exceptions for normal situations, how do you locate unusual (ie _exception_al) situations?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are other strong reasons not to use exceptions too much, especially performance-wise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the performance bit is very niche, in code that gets execute thousands of times per second in a high-performance application it matters. But "programming" becomes very different when focusing on performance (e.g. we might write logic that looks counter-intuitive to us but results in fewer cache misses), and for 99% of code, this doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Granted, there's some language in which exceptions are really (and I mean *** really) slow, but others, such as Python, have fairly efficient exceptions so performance shouldn't be an issue for any program that should have been written in Python to being with.</p>
<p>The first point the commenter brings up sounds much more persuasive. Namely that exceptions, even when caught, are something one should care about.</p>
<p>I.e. my code might throw an exception during runtime and I'll catch it and try to handle the situation and move forward as best I can, but I need to see those exceptions when debugging.</p>
<p>This is a valid argument but there are two ways we can deal with this:</p>
<p>a) Add some code to indicate a specific <code>catch</code> is not meant to occur</p>
<p>b) Have specific exceptions for situations that should not happen (i.e. an "TheFactThatThisHappenedIsBadPleasePayAttention" exception class)</p>
<p>But still, this means that you'd have to potentially redesign your codebase a bit if you wanted to use exceptions as a control flow mechanism and still make use of their power to signal potential errors without crashing the whole program to do so.</p>
<p>The second answer in that same thread is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceptions are basically non-local goto statements with all the consequences of the latter. Using exceptions for flow control violates a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>, make programs hard to read (remember that programs are written for programmers first).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this is not what compiler vendors expect. They expect exceptions to be thrown rarely, and they usually let the throw code be quite inefficient. Throwing exceptions is one of the most expensive operations in .NET.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, some languages (notably Python) use exceptions as flow-control constructs. For example, iterators raise a StopIteration exception if there are no further items. Even standard language constructs (such as for) rely on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the performance argument, but at least with the added caveat that indeed in some languages this is a none issue.</p>
<p>The more interesting point is that exceptions are harder to reason about since you're not sure where they are thrown, take for example the following code:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    a()
    b()
    c()
except:
    foo()
</code></pre>
<p>When calling <code>foo</code> here we can't know why <code>foo</code> was called (i.e. was it because of a failure in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> ?).</p>
<p>If it's non-obvious where an exception might be thrown one can simply implement multiple exception catching constructs (in the above case one for each function that is called).</p>
<p>But then again, I think this argument doesn't hold much water when we consider something like:</p>
<pre><code>if not a() or not b() or not c():
    foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Not knowing what code triggered an exception because multiple bits of it can throw is the same as not knowing what code triggered an if because multiple bits of it can set the True/False value that it evaluates.</p>
<p>This isn't a fault with exceptions, just a general issue one can introduce using any control flow mechanism.</p>
<p>Other than that, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/621338/necromancer">necromancer</a> makes an interesting point in that thread, but most other arguments seem to follow the same ideas but phrased more poorly.</p>
<h2>III - Stack Exchange SE on why exceptions are bad</h2>
<p>Next, let's look at a <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why">fairly popular post on the software engineering stack exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Why are exceptions bad?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4091/blueberryfields">blueberryfields</a> makes a few arguments for why they should be considered an anti-pattern. Let's take these one by one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceptions are, in essence, sophisticated GOTO statements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They aren't, they have stricter rules than goto statements. …</p></div></div>

    Posted on September 16, 2020
    
</p>

<p>If I were to travel back in time 4 years ago, and tell my old self that Haskell was starting to lose its shine, I wouldn’t believe it. I grew up on Haskell, my appetite for category theory was whetted by Haskell, my biggest programming projects have been in Haskell, and my dream job was to work at a company that used Haskell.</p>
<p>But now, I find myself simply not as excited about Haskell as I used to be. What changed?</p>
<p>I think there are a couple things. I think one primary factor is that the kind of programming that Haskell really excells in; i.e.&nbsp;creating abstract, correct interfaces for things, is just not a type of programming that’s interesting to me anymore. When I wanted to work on software as a career, a language that allowed incredible facilities in not repeating yourself was very useful. Types that ensure correctness of data interchange, or lenses that allow access to complicated data structures are all very well for implementing, say, a compiler, or complicated business logic in a web backend. However, my interests in software are now primarily as a scientific/mathematical tool. Numerical algorithms can be done in Haskell, but they don’t really gain much benefit from the type system, and they also don’t have great library support.</p>
<p>No doubt Haskell could be made into the kind of language to use for the problems that I am interested in, but given the choice between working on the problems that interest me, and working on infrastructure for the problems that interest me, I would rather work on the problems that interest me. The general feeling that I have is that Haskell is a great tool for a software engineer, but I don’t want to be a software engineer, I want to be a mathematician that sometimes uses computers.</p>
<p>But there is another reason too. While I think that Haskell is still a great language, it is close to 30 years old at this point. It manages to stay fresh and relevant with an ever-growing list of extensions, and constantly changing best practices and libraries (which is itself a problem…), but it would be very sad if we as a society of programmers had failed to surpass it in any respect with any of the programming languages that have had the advantage of starting from a clean slate. In this post, I want to talk about these successor languages, and what I think about them.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, one of Haskell’s great strengths is as a systems language. It manages to be much faster than most dynamic languages, while allowing a much higher-level interface than traditional systems languages like C (obviously). One great example of a “systems” program written in Haskell is git-annex. It is a git addition that adds tracking of large files, and was my primary backup system for a long time (I eventually decided that I didn’t need the additional power from it, and was better served by a more seamless solution).</p>
<p>However, in 2020, the premier system’s language is surely Rust. It would be unfair to compare the performance of Rust and Haskell, because Haskell is optimized for things other than performance. That being said, Rust is <em>faster</em> and <em>lower-latency</em> than Haskell, both of which are important. However, it also has a great type system, unlike C or C++ (we don’t talk about Go…). The type system in Rust is obviously very influenced by the type system of Haskell, but they also implemented “ownership” which allows for the killer feature garbage-collection free automatic memory management.</p>
<p>When I first started using Rust, I really missed monads. But here’s the thing. Having used lots of monads in Haskell, and read lots of blog posts about monads, I’ve learned that in systems contexts, it’s often best to just have a simple monad stack that just consists of Reader + IO (and Maybe’s and Option’s sprinkled about occasionally). Huge monad transformer stacks often raise more problems than they solve. But Reader + IO is <em>essentially</em> the “default monad stack” of Rust.</p>
<p>Rust also has some other killer features, like the ability to compile to webassembly (yes there is ghcjs, but, really, do you want to use ghcjs?) It also from the beginning was targetted towards industry, and consequentially has a much more vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p>This all being said, I think it is worth looking at the features that are prominent in Haskell that ended up going to Rust</p>
<ul>
<li>Typeclasses (in Rust they are Traits)</li>
<li>Sum types (you may take this for granted, but a lot of languages don’t have them….)</li>
<li>Pervasive pattern matching</li>
<li>Hindley-Mindler type inference (automatic type inference for variables)</li>
<li>Pervasiveness of things being <em>expressions</em> rather than statements</li>
<li>Parametric Polymorphism</li>
<li>The feeling that once your program compiles, it will run</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that we should recognize Rust for what it is, a child of Haskell and the Haskell community, and like all good parents, we should want it to do better than the previous generation. In as much as Haskell is the ideas that form Haskell, the success of Rust is the success of Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="idris">Idris</h2>
<p>OK, mainstream programming languages are great, but sometimes you just want to make the perfect type-based interface to your stuff and show the imperative scrubs what a wiz-kid you are. Or alternatively, sometimes you really care that your software is correct. Or you want to concretize a new category-theory inspired design for a part of a compiler. Nowadays, the language for that is not Haskell, it is Idris.</p>
<p>There are about six different ways to sort of have dependent types in Haskell (types that depend on values, like a length-<span>n</span>) array. I don’t really fully understand any of them, and it is totally unclear to me how they work together. Presumably, there are blogs which outline the One True Way, but… it’s tough. In Idris, it just seems perfectly natural to use dependent types, like, why wouldn’t you able to have a type parameter which was a value? In many ways other than dependent types, Idris is a much cleaner language than Haskell too. And with Idris2, it has support for <em>linear types</em>, which allow mutability in a functional context via guarantees that nobody is going to try and use the old value. If I want to play around with a cool type system in a language that can also actually do things with the real world (i.e., unlike Agda or Coq), I would go to Idris rather than Haskell.</p>
<p>But Idris is undeniably Haskell’s child. The first version was written in Haskell (it is now self-hosting). They are similar in more ways than it is worth counting. Enough said.</p>
<h2 id="julia">Julia</h2>
<p>Unlike the first two, Julia doesn’t really muscle into Haskell’s territory. Scientific computing was never really Haskell’s forte, despite there being some very cool libraries written in it, like <code>ad</code> for autodifferentiation, or various array-handling packages that automatically fused consecutive array operations.</p>
<p>Also, Julia is a dynamically typed language. How could a filthy dynamically typed language ever claim to be Haskell’s child??</p>
<p>Well, for one it steals some of those cool libraries, and makes them much better! Flux is a neural networks library which essentially is just autodifferentiation + some nice utilities, and it is already competitive in my mind with TensorFlow. Julia also has StaticArrays, which integrates the size of the array into the type, and Julia has some neat fusion abilities too for making array operations really fast.</p>
<p>But wait, you ask, how can it do this if it’s not a statically typed language? Well, Julia is not your average dynamically typed language. It actually has a very interesting type system, a full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this post, and the focus on types as the unit of programming is (somewhat?) similar to Haskell (now I’m stretching it a little though).</p>
<p>The real reason I include Julia, however, is because for me personally, it has replaced Haskell as the place to do category theory. This is because of a shift of viewpoint: rather than providing a type system into which category theory can be embedded in to guide typical software engineering tasks, Julia provides a system in which <em>computations</em> in category theory can be carried out in an efficient way. Specifically, I’m talking about <a href="https://github.com/olynch/Catlab.jl">Catlab.jl</a>. A discussion of Catlab.jl is also beyond the scope of this post, but I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>Therefore, I count Julia as a child of Haskell (or maybe, I count Catlab.jl as a child of Haskell) because the idea of organizing computation with category theory would not exist in the same way if it weren’t for Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I could talk to the Haskell-obsessed teenager that was me four years ago, I would tell him to keep his mind open. Haskell is still great for a lot of things (compilers come to mind), but if Haskell couldn’t inspire superior successors, there wouldn’t be worthwhile ideas in Haskell. There are those on the internet who are talking about how Haskell is dying, and they may or may not be wrong. Stephen Diehl, one of my main Haskell idols, is distancing himself from the Haskell community because of Haskell’s use as intellectual eye-candy on scam cryptocurrencies, and I think that there may be a tipping point where Haskell loses the zeitgeist of being exciting, and because it never had much of a foothold to begin with in industry, slips into irrelevance. But Haskell will always live on; it had a huge impact on many programmers and many languages disproportionate to its actual use, and it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>

Please read our previous posts as it provides context to the results described in this post.</p>

</ul>
<p>During our <strong>Fault Injection</strong> research on the <strong>ESP32</strong>, we gradually took steps forward in order to identify the required vulnerabilities that allowed us to bypass <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> with a single <strong>EM</strong> glitch. Moreover, we did not only achieve <strong>code execution</strong>, we also extracted the <strong>plain-text flash</strong> data from the chip.</p>
<p><strong>Espressif</strong> requested a <strong>CVE</strong>  for the attack described in this post: <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">CVE-2020-13629</a>. Please note, that the attack as described in this post, is only applicable to <strong>ESP32</strong> silicon revision 0 and 1. The newer <strong>ESP32 V3</strong> silicon supports functionality to disable the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> that we leveraged for the attack.</p>

<p>The <strong>ESP32</strong> implements an <strong>UART bootloader</strong> in its <strong>ROM code</strong>. This feature allows, among other functionality, to program the external flash. It's not uncommon that such functionality is implemented in the <strong>ROM code</strong> as it's quite robust as the code cannot get corrupt easily. If this functionality would be implemented by code stored in the external flash, any corruption of the flash may result in a bricked device.</p>
<p>Typically, this type of functionality is accessed by booting the chip in a special <strong>boot mode</strong>. The <strong>boot mode</strong> selection is often done using one or more external strap pin(s) which are set before resetting the chip. On the <strong>ESP32</strong> it works exactly like this pin <code>G0</code> which is exposed externally.</p>
<p>The <strong>UART bootloader</strong> supports many interesting <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/Serial-Protocol#command-opcodes" target="_blank">commands</a> that can be used to read/write memory, read/write registers and even execute a stub from <strong>SRAM</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="executing-arbitrary-code">Executing arbitrary code</h4>
<p>The <strong>UART bootloader</strong> supports loading and executing arbitrary code using the <code>load_ram</code> command. The <strong>ESP32</strong>'s SDK includes all the tooling required to compile the code that can be executed from <strong>SRAM</strong>. For example, the following code snippet will print <code>SRAM CODE\n</code> on the serial interface.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>void</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>noreturn</span><span>))</span> <span>call_start_cpu0</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ets_printf</span><span>(</span><span>"SRAM CODE</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>esptool.py</code> tool, which is part of the <strong>ESP32</strong>'s SDK, can be used to load the compiled binary into the <strong>SRAM</strong> after which it will be executed.</p>
<pre><code>esptool.py --chip esp32 --no-stub --port COM3 load_ram code.bin
</code></pre><p>Interestingly, the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> cannot disabled and therefore always accessible, even when <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> are enabled.</p>
<h4 id="additional-measures">Additional measures</h4>
<p>Obviously, if no additional security measures would be taken, leaving the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> always accessible would render <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> likely useless. Therefore, <strong>Espressif</strong> implemented additional security measures which are enabled using dedicated <strong>eFuses</strong>.</p>
<p>These are security configuration bits implemented in special memory, often referred to as <strong>OTP memory</strong>, which can typically only change from 0 to 1. This guarantees, that once enabled, is enabled forever. The following <strong>OTP memory</strong> bits are used to disable specific functionality when the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT</strong>: disables flash encryption operation</li>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT</strong>: disables transparent flash decryption</li>
<li><strong>DISABLE_DL_CACHE</strong>: disables the entire MMU flash cache</li>
</ul>
<p>The most relevant <strong>OTP memory</strong> bit is <strong>DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT</strong> as it disables the transparent decryption of the flash data.</p>
<p>If not set, it would be possible to simply access the plain-text flash data while the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in its <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>If set, any access to the flash, when the chip is in <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode, will yield just the encrypted data. The <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> feature, which is fully implemented in hardware and transparent to the processor,  is only enabled in when the <strong>ESP32</strong> is in <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>The attacks described in this post have all these bits set to 1.</p>

<p>The <strong>SRAM</strong> memory that's used by the <strong>ESP32</strong> is typical technology that's used by many chips. It's commonly used to the <strong>ROM</strong>'s stack and executing the first bootloader from flash. It's convenient to use at early boot as it typically require no configuration before it can be used.</p>
<p>We know from previous experience that the data stored in <strong>SRAM</strong> memory is persistent until it's overwritten or the required power is removed from the physical cells. After a <strong>cold reset</strong> (i.e. power-cycle) of the chip, the <strong>SRAM</strong> will be reset to its default state. This often semi-random and unique per chip as the default value for each bit (i.e. 0 or 1) is different.</p>
<p>However, after a <strong>warm reset</strong>, where the entire chip is reset without removing the power, it may happen that the data stored in <strong>SRAM</strong> remains unaffected. This persistence of the data is visualized in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-sram-persistence.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-sram-persistence.png" width="700px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>We decided to figure out if this behavior holds up for the <strong>ESP32</strong> as well. We identified that the hardware <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/wdts.html" target="_blank">watchdog</a> can be used to issue a <strong>warm reset</strong> from software. This <strong>watchdog</strong> can also be issued when the chip is in <strong>UART bootloader</strong> boot mode and therefore we can use it to reset the <strong>ESP32</strong> back into <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode.</p>
<p>Using some test code, loaded and executed in <strong>SRAM</strong> using the <strong>UART bootloader</strong>, we determined that the data in <strong>SRAM</strong> is indeed persistent after issuing a <strong>warm reset</strong> using the <strong>watchdog</strong>. Effectively this means we can boot the <strong>ESP32</strong> in <strong>Normal</strong> boot mode with the <strong>SRAM</strong> filled with controlled data.</p>
<p>But… how can we (ab)use this?</p>

<p>We envisioned that we may be able to leverage the persistence of data in <strong>SRAM</strong> across <strong>warm resets</strong> for an attack. The first attack we came up with is to fill the <strong>SRAM</strong> with code using the <strong>UART bootloader</strong> and issue a <strong>warm reset</strong> using the <strong>watchdog</strong>. Then, we inject a glitch while the <strong>ROM code</strong> is overwriting this code with the <strong>flash bootloader</strong> during a normal boot.</p>
<p>We got this ideas as during our previous experiments, where we <a href="">turned data transfers into code execution</a>, we noticed that for some experiments the chip started executing from the entry address before the bootloader was finished copying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to try it…</p>

<p>After running these experiments for more than a day, resulting in more than 1 million experiments, we did not observe any successful glitch…</p>
<h4 id="an-unexpected-result">An unexpected result</h4>

September 22, 2020 | https://free.cofree.io/2020/09/01/type-errors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://free.cofree.io/2020/09/01/type-errors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        <p>Generally speaking, GHC’s error messages are fairly helpful and intelligible (so long as you don’t go wild with type-level
programming). But there are definitely a few common but relatively less clear ones. Some of the GHC type error messages
that can potentially lead to bewilderment are discussed in this post. The GHC version I used is 8.10.2.</p>



<p>If you’ve written Haskell for any amount of time, you’ve probably seen this error message, and it is hardly a confusing one.
However, the word “rigid” may seem counter-intuitive, and one might wonder what it actually means.
Consider the following function definition:</p>



<p>This definition does not compile and the error message is</p>

<div><div><pre><code>• Couldn't match expected type ‘Bool’ with actual type ‘a’
  ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
    the type signature for:
      f :: forall a. a -&gt; a
    at Example.hs:11:1-11
• In the first argument of ‘not’, namely ‘x’
  In the expression: not x
  In an equation for ‘f’: f x = not x
• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at Example.hs:12:3)
    f :: a -&gt; a (bound at Example.hs:12:1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should be obvious why <code>f</code> doesn’t type check, but a potential point of confusion for some, including myself when I first
encountered an error message like this is: why does it say <code>a</code> is “rigid”? <code>a</code> can represent any type, so shouldn’t it be “flexible”?</p>

<p><code>a</code> is flexible indeed, but only from the perspective of the caller of <code>f</code>. From the perspective of the definition of <code>f</code>, it is not
at all flexible. The definition of <code>f</code> must treat <code>a</code> as some unknown but fixed type, and must do the exact same thing
for all possible <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Haskell has several sorts of type variables, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type variables written by programmers, such as those bound by <code>forall</code>s in type signatures, and those appearing in type
applications and type annotations.</li>
  <li>Type variables used internally by the compiler. These include
    <ul>
      <li><em>Unification type variables</em> (or flexible type variables, meta type variables, unification variables). They are fresh variables allocated
to stand for unknown types that need to be determined. One of the tasks of the type inference engine is to determine their actual types by
finding a substitution for each unification variable. Unification variables are flexible in the sense that
they can unify with any type or type variable that does not contain <code>forall</code>s<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (except when they are untouchable, which will be explained later).</li>
      <li><em>Rigid type variables</em> (or skolem type variables, skolem constants, skolems). They are fresh variables allocated to stand for unknown but fixed
types. Their actual types do not need to be, and cannot be determined. They are rigid in the sense that they cannot unify with
anything other than themselves or unification variables. In particular, a rigid type variable cannot unify with a concrete
type or type constructor, or another rigid type variable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Unification type variables and rigid type variables are freshly allocated by the type checker. In an error message like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Couldn't match expected type &lt;expected&gt; with actual type &lt;actual&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>&lt;expected&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;actual&gt;</code> often contain type variables not written by the programmer, because they are compiler-allocated.</p>

<p>When type checking the above <code>f</code> function, where <code>a</code> is a programmer-written, universally quantified type variable, GHC first allocates
a rigid type variable for it (a process called skolemization), because from <code>f</code>’s point of view, <code>a</code> is unknown and fixed (or existential). The body
of <code>f</code> requests that this rigid type variable be unified with <code>Bool</code>, which the type checker outright refuses, hence the above error message.</p>



<p>A rigid/skolem type variable cannot escape, via a unification variable, the scope where it is introduced. In other words, a
rigid type variable can unify with a unification variable, but not when that unification variable has a bigger scope.
This can happen in two cases.</p>

<p><strong>1. Type checking a polymorphic function argument:</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fun</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>

<span>arg</span> <span>::</span> <span>c</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>c</span>
<span>arg</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>fun</span> <span>arg</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This leads to the following error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>• Couldn't match type ‘b0’ with ‘[a]’
    because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
  This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
    a type expected by the context:
      forall a. [a] -&gt; b0
    at Example.hs:18:9-11
  Expected type: [a] -&gt; b0
    Actual type: b0 -&gt; b0
• In the first argument of ‘fun’, namely ‘arg’
  In the expression: fun arg
  In an equation for ‘x’: x = fun arg
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order for <code>x = fun arg</code> to be well typed, <code>arg</code>’s type must subsume (i.e., be more general than or equal
to) the type required by <code>fun</code>. This is <em>not</em> the case here. <code>fun</code> requires that its argument be able to convert a list of <code>a</code>s for any
arbitrary <code>a</code>, into a <em>fixed</em> <code>b</code>. <code>b</code> can be flexibly chosen, for instance <code>fun (length :: [a] -&gt; Int)</code> would be legal, but it is
chosen before <code>a</code>, and must be fixed (i.e., does not depend on <code>a</code>) once chosen. <code>arg</code> does not satisfy this requirement, because it maps an
arbitrary <code>a</code> to itself. Therefore, this program is rejected.</p>

<p>When type checking <code>x = fun arg</code>, the type checker allocates a rigid type variable for <code>a</code>, and allocates unification
variables for <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. It then determines that the type of both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> is <code>[a]</code>. But sadly, <code>b</code> is not allowed to
unify with <code>[a]</code>, because <code>b</code> is bound by an (implicit) top-level <code>forall</code>, while <code>a</code> is bound by an inner <code>forall</code>. If they were
allowed to unify, the rigid/skolem type variable <code>a</code> would escape its scope via unification variable <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, this is how the ST monad works.</p>

<p><strong>2. Opening existential types:</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span>
<span>f</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This leads to a similar skolem escape error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>• Couldn't match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘Maybe a’
    because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
  This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
    a pattern with constructor: A :: forall a. a -&gt; A,
    in an equation for ‘f’
    at Example.hs:12:4-6
• In the expression: Just x
  In an equation for ‘f’: f (A x) = Just x
• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at Example.hs:12:6)
    f :: A -&gt; p (bound at Example.hs:12:1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type of the value encapsulated in an existential type (<code>x</code> in this example) is considered private.
When an existential type is opened via pattern matching<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, a rigid type variable is allocated to denote the (unknown but fixed)
private type, i.e., <code>x</code>’s type, and a unification variable (<code>p</code> in this example) is allocated to denote the type of
the pattern matching branch. This rigid type variable must not escape the scope of the branch via the unification variable.</p>

<p>In other words, Let <code>a</code> denote <code>x</code>’s type in <code>case A of (A x) -&gt; ...</code>. The types of local bindings within <code>...</code> (declared
in <code>let</code> or <code>where</code> clauses) may refer to <code>a</code> (but you can’t write explicit type signatures for such bindings), but the type of
the entire <code>...</code> may not. Therefore the above <code>f</code> is ill-typed because the right hand side has type <code>Maybe a</code> which of course
mentions <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>If Haskell allowed the <code>exists</code> keyword for existential quantification, <code>f</code> would be well-typed because it would be possible
to assign the following type to <code>f</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>exists</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But Haskell doesn’t have the <code>exists</code> keyword, because <code>exists</code> can be expressed in terms of <code>forall</code> and <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>exists</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>  <span>≅</span>  <span>forall</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>r</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Intuitively, saying “I have a <code>Maybe a</code> for some <code>a</code>, but I won’t tell you what <code>a</code> is” is equivalent to saying “If you give me
a function that maps an arbitrary <code>Maybe a</code> to <code>r</code>, then I’ll give you an <code>r</code> back, by applying your function to my secret <code>Maybe a</code>”.</p>

<p>But note that the LHS and RHS above are only isomorphic; they are not identical. So <code>f</code> in the above example
doesn’t have a valid haskell type, but the following function <code>g</code>, which is isomorphic to <code>f</code>, does have a valid type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>g</span> <span>::</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>r</span>
<span>g</span> <span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>h</span> <span>=</span> <span>h</span> <span>(</span><span>Just</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Incidentally, in intuitionistic second-order propositional logic<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, not only the existential quantifier, but also
negation, conjunction, disjunction and absurdity, can all be expressed in terms of the universal quantifier and <code>-&gt;</code>. For example,
absurdity (corresponding to Haskell’s <code>Void</code> type) is <code>forall a. a</code>, and <code>a \/ b</code> (corresponding to Haskell’s sum type)
is <code>forall r. (a -&gt; r) -&gt; (b -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code>. But this is off topic so I digress.</p>



<p>The “untouchable” error can happen when you pattern match against a GADT without supplying a
type signature. Consider this example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>A</span> <span>::</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bool</span>

<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>case</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemingly trivial and unproblematic code does not type check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>• Couldn't match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘Bool’
    ‘p’ is untouchable
      inside the constraints: a ~ Bool
      bound by a pattern with constructor: A :: A Bool,
                in a case alternative
      at Example.hs:15:11
  ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
    the inferred type of f :: A a -&gt; p
    at Example.hs:15:1-19
  Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘f’
• In the expression: True
  In a case alternative: A -&gt; True
  In the expression: \case A -&gt; True
• Relevant bindings include
    f :: A a -&gt; p (bound at Example.hs:15:1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because <code>f</code> has more than one valid type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that neither of the above two types is more general than the other. They are just two different and incomparable types. In other words,
<code>f</code> lacks a <em>principal type</em> (a unique most general type)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. The fix is to add a type signature for <code>f</code>, which is clearly indicated in the error message.</p>

<p>The word “untouchable” refers to the fact that the return type of the pattern matching, although a unification
variable, is considered unavailable for unification in this particular branch. Therefore it can’t actually be unified with <code>Bool</code>.</p>

<p>If data type <code>A</code> had other data constructors, and the pattern match in <code>f</code> had more branches, then another branch may end up successfully
unifying the result of the pattern match with Bool. For instance if <code>A</code> and <code>f</code> are defined as</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>A</span> <span>::</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bool</span>
  <span>B</span> <span>::</span> <span>A</span> <span>a</span>

<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>case</span> <span>A</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>;</span> <span>B</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then…</p></div></div>

<p>
Lately we have been working on <a href="https://bytepack.io/">Bytepack</a> to help developers deliver and sell packages to companies and enterprises.</p>
<p>
In Bytepack, authors can push new packages at any time. Publishing said packages is done with your usual package manager tool, such as <code>mix hex.publish</code> in Elixir or <code>npm publish</code> for Node.js. Once you call these commands, the request goes to specific endpoints that implement the Hex.pm and npm APIs.</p>
<p>
The specific steps are shown in our “New package” page:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://dashbit.co/images/posts/2020/bytepack-new-package.png" alt="ytepack new package screen"><br></p>
<p>
The <code>/packages/new</code> route is a <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix LiveView</a> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>BytepackWeb.PackageLive.New</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8580950847-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>BytepackWeb</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:live_view</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="8580950847-7">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8580950847-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Nothing special so far. But here is where LiveView is a big deal.</p>
<p>
To improve the user experience, we also wanted to automatically update the browser with the package information whenever the user publishes it. Implementing this functionality in LiveView requires three changes.</p>
<p>
First we broadcast an event whenever a package is created to a “package:new” topic under the user:</p>
<pre><code><span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-1">(</span><span>
  </span><span>Bytepack.PubSub</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"user:</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-2">#{</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-2">}</span><span>:package:new"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3903443770-3">{</span><span>:published</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>package</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-3">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3903443770-1">)</span></code></pre>
<p>
Back in <code>PackageLive.New</code>, we change <code>mount/3</code> to also subscribe to said topic:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>mount</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-1">(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>socket</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>authenticate</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-3">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-3">)</span><span>

  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>connected?</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-4">(</span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-4">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-5">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-6">(</span><span>
      </span><span>Bytepack.PubSub</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"user:</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-7">#{</span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>assigns</span><span>.</span><span>current_user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-7">}</span><span>:package:new"</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-6">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-5">end</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="1794271301-8">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>authenticate</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-9">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>session</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-9">)</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-8">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="1794271301-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
and then write a clause to handle said events:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-1">(</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-2">{</span><span>:published</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>package_id</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-2">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>socket</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3117829849-3">do</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3117829849-4">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>live_redirect</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-5">(</span><span>socket</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/packages/</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-6">#{</span><span>package_id</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-6">}</span><span>"</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-5">)</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-4">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3117829849-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
And that’s it! Now we redirect the browser to the newly created package page whenever the package is published.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://dashbit.co/images/posts/2020/bytepack-new-package.gif" alt="ytepack new package screen"><br></p>
<p>
We didn’t have to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
manually establish WebSockets or long-polling connections  </li>
  <li>
create a separate endpoint to send requests to  </li>
  <li>
define a specific JSON payload between client/server  </li>
  <li>
write any front-end glue code  </li>
  <li>
setup third-party dependencies for pubsub, such as Redis, nor anything else to run at scale  </li>
  <li>
etc  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Compared to what <a href="https://phoenixphrenzy.com/">others have built with LiveView</a>, this is absolutely trivial. However, the fact we can set this up in less than 2 minutes is that excites me!</p>
<p>
LiveView comes with its own integrated testing story too. We can test everything from the comfort of Elixir, without a need to bring heavy-hitters such as Selenium or any webdriver.</p>
<p>
To run in development, we only need to start our Phoenix server. We don’t need external tooling in production either. We can deploy this to <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, <a href="https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cluster.html">configure clustering</a>, and everything just works across multiple nodes.</p>
<p>
While this is a very limited sample of what LiveView can do, it highlights the beauty of its model and, perhaps more importantly, it shows all of the things we don’t have to manage nor worry about. At the end of the day, the Bytepack team can focus more on the user experience than we would otherwise, thanks to LiveView’s accessibility.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When we launched nearly 2 years ago, we declared our first principles approach to banking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Challenge the assumptions and limitations in banking and re-evaluate them from a more current point of view."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement did not come out of a contrived workshop, or committee, or a board of investors. It was the resonating sentiment of a team that had spent years in the weeds of banking software and its bureaucracy. Existing banks have too much baggage to be able to see the future of banking for what it could be. They lacked the courage to really re-invent themselves. Some questions that emerged from that period:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why doesn’t every transaction have a timestamp, a merchant logo?</em></li>
<li><em>Why are all my payments to a particular person not grouped?</em></li>
<li><em>Why isn’t it easier to pay someone I’ve paid before?</em></li>
<li><em>Why am I sitting on hold on my phone to resolve an issue?</em></li>
<li><em>How can saving money be fun and engaging?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We knew that if we followed our noses and solved these user-centric problems, and many others of course, that winning customers would take care of itself. We now have over 280,000 Upsiders and counting.</p>
<h2>Making Feedback Easy</h2>
<p>Up does not do traditional user testing. There, I said it. That’s our dirty secret.</p>
<p>We think there are other techniques that are faster and better indicators of real-world behaviour. We also believe we have two advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An innovation mindset</strong></li>
<li><strong>A deeper relationship with our customers than any financial institution in Australia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Much of banking is a known problem space. We feel like we're taking a more creative approach to the problem, but that's not to say we don't rely on user feedback. Our <em>Talk to Us</em> section encourages Upsiders to give us feedback or suggest ideas. To date, we have received over 6,000 ideas via this channel, making it one of the most crucial conduits into the minds of our customers. We also have other highly-engaged channels such as our socials and the newsletter where we hear, almost instantly, what customers think of what we’ve delivered.</p>

<h2>Engagement Is the Name of the Game</h2>
<p>So where do we get our inspiration? It's rarely in the banking or fintech space. These are the apps that exist on billions of devices and set the bar for mobile digital experiences:</p>

<p>While they vary in purpose, their collective dominance in the landscape means they teach and familiarise patterns to expect when using our phones.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How does TikTok allow you to react to content quickly and effortlessly?</em></li>
<li><em>What similarities are there between Whatsapp, Messenger and Instagram when conversing with friends?</em></li>
<li><em>When explaining new features what language do these platforms use? When do they use visualisations? When do they use words?</em></li>
<li><em>When is Snapchat playful and when is it serious?</em></li>
<li><em>Do I identify with my real name or username for Instagram? What about Facebook?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As users we immerse ourselves in the apps that have nailed engagement. While acknowledging the patterns they establish, we also appreciate the balance between knowing when to follow them and when to do our own thing. Up has a handful of atypical patterns, but as long as they are usable and intuitive they can become distinct moments used to engage and delight.</p>
<p>Why is it so important that Upsiders engage with the Up app? Aside from the opportunity to nurture a relationship through frequent interactions, we also think that being more engaged with your money encourages better financial literacy. It’s common that people fall into credit trouble by continuing to use their plastic cards without checking their balance regularly. By making Up an engaging experience, we’re making Upsiders more confident and connected to their finances.</p>
<h2>Becoming an Upsider</h2>
<p>We’ve previously deep-dived on our <a href="https://up.com.au/blog/designing-a-super-powered-welcome-pack-experience/">card delivery experience</a>. Before we could even get that far, we had to solve the huge problem of enabling people to sign up for a bank account without leaving the comfort of a mobile app — something that had not been done before in Australia.</p>
<p>We knew that the sheer amount of information we needed from the user was going to be a challenge. Banking is highly regulated in Australia, so we had to cater for many types of identity data (passport, license etc). Most apps can get away with just asking for a username, email and password.</p>
<p>Mobile flows tend to be atomic with a single input per screen, so with identity verification we were anticipating quite a long flow. Our focus was to trim the fat wherever possible, not just by reducing the total number of screens but also by making it easy for people to understand what was being asked of them as they progressed.</p>

<p>We fought to reduce the amount of data we needed to collect. Why does banking need to know your gender? We cut it. Do you need your card sent to a PO Box? We’ll give you a contextual experience based on answers you’ve already provided rather than a scrolling form full of fields. As we tested the new flow amongst ourselves and with beta users from our waitlist, we made a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchoring buttons to the bottom of the viewport, and making them full-width. Close to your thumb and easy to hit.</li>
<li>Removing anything extra like images, so you could move faster without distractions.</li>
<li>Using conversational instructions (eg “What is your mobile number?” Instead of “Enter mobile number”). And only using secondary body text when it was really necessary.</li>
<li>Using example text for the input placeholder, so you'd know what the right info looks like.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>All of these small iterations reduced the cognitive load for users and made it feel easy and fast, despite the number of screens. This granularity was important as there isn’t actually a single sign up flow, but several which vary depending on your circumstances and the information we are required to collect.</p>
<h2>Up Yeah!</h2>
<p>Once we became more confident in our onboarding flow and how streamlined it was becoming, you could feel the team were ready to ship it and move onto the next bit of work.</p>
<p>It’s easy to have the blinkers on when you have such a measurable and objective goal — get users into the app in under x time — but stepping back, we made the observation that although we’d nailed sign up speed, something was missing the first time you landed on your activity feed. A moment that should feel significant and celebratory — you’ve literally just opened a bank account in under 3 minutes through your phone — feels clinical and unimpressive. We appreciate great brand moments in digital experiences, most notably MailChimp’s use of emotive design throughout their email software.</p>

<p>Email campaigns are stressful exercises — you can’t unsend them once they go out. It’s the nature of the beast. Interestingly, it was the arm of their mascot beast Freddie that was used in these cute but situationally-aware animations. The red button before launch, the high five once your campaign is live, and the rock fist for scheduled campaigns.</p>
<p>Our creative director Pete was eager to create a moment post-signup that made you go “f*ck yeah” in celebration.</p>

</figure>
<p>Almost immediately after this launched it was being shared by new Upsiders and acknowledged through our feedback channels. Of course you only give yourself an opportunity for these moments if you are nailing the fundamentals. But this reinforcement encouraged us to lean into these seemingly frivolous treatments as a way to delight Upsiders while building a stronger brand.</p>
<h2>Logging in Sucks</h2>
<p>Sometimes the design process involves considering what you don’t see as much as what you do see. For Up, removing the login screen is a great example of this. Banking apps tend to have heavy authentication flows before you see your feed or landing screen. It’s easy to see how this came to be; mobile apps came after desktop banking sites, and so inherited their secure lockdown context. And perhaps it goes back even further back to the mindset of “money belongs in a vault, behind a locked door”.</p>
<p>With all the technological advances in mobile device security, from the humble PIN code to sophisticated biometric recognition, it’s worth questioning some of the assumptions and trade-offs made in the name of security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Logging in is a big friction point. Especially if we’re trying to help inform you about your finances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s an interesting distinction that’s prominent in tech — the difference between security and privacy. If we break out of the world of banking apps and look at some of the apps we use each and every day – imagine if you had to enter a passcode every time you opened your email, or your messages? Yet if someone had access to either, they could reset every password you have and really cause you some headaches. We found a helpful albeit simplified distinction when approaching this aspect of the user-experience:</p>
<br>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><img loading="lazy" src="https://up.com.au/251bbe56c807fe4657239958a04f14e6/zap-coat.gif" alt="Mailchimp animations">
        </td>
        <td>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          Protecting information that is sensitive
          <em> "Read Only"</em>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><img loading="lazy" src="https://up.com.au/6e9f440aae0b397bd198cc1182838ed9/zap-lock.gif" alt="Mailchimp animations">
        </td>
        <td>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          Protecting against being compromised financially
          <em>"Write Access"</em>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A design decision we’ve made with this framework is removing the need to enter a passcode by default (which can be re-enabled in settings), and also when moving money where there isn’t any risk. Transfering between Savers doesn’t require you to use your phone’s authentication flow (e.g. passcode, Apple’s FaceID or Android’s BioAuth), but moving money into your spending account or sending money outside of your account (e.g. to another bank or via BPay) does.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to ask for authentication where appropriate to maximise security, while also letting Upsiders enjoy the benefits of being more informed and connected with their money in a low-friction way.  Our push …</p></section></div></div>

<li><a href="#mitigations">Mitigations</a>: Ways to prevent and detect the backdooring threat</li>
</ul>
<p>During threat modeling we identified that an adversary might tamper with model files. From a technical point of view this means an adversary gained access to the model file used in production and is able overwrite it.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-threat-model-modelfile.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-threat-model-modelfile.png" alt="Threat Model - the asset model file"></a></p>
<p>This post explores two ways to backdoor the Husky AI model and how to mitigate the attacks, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#tampering">Tampering</a></strong> with the model weights manually via the Keras APIs</li>
<li><strong><a href="#backdooring">Backdooring</a></strong> via training the model to learn a backdoor image pattern</li>
</ol>
<p>The inspiration for some of these attacks come from Michael Kissner’s paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07658.pdf">Hacking Neural Networks: A short introduction</a>. I recommend checking that out - there is lots of gold in that paper.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="model-file-formats">Model file formats</h2>
<p>A common format for storing machine learning models is the HDF format, version 5.</p>
<p>It is recognizable by the <code>.h5</code> file extension. In case of Husky AI the file is called <code>huskymodel.h5</code>.</p>
<p>You might remember when the model was initially created, it was saved using the Keras <code>model.save</code> API. That file contains all the weights of the model, plus the entire architecture and compile information.</p>
<p>Keras has another <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize">format called <code>SavedModel</code></a>.</p>
<p>The attacks described here should work in either case, because we are only using Keras APIs themselves to tamper with the model. The attacks modify weights of the model to change the outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="tampering">Tampering with the model file</h2>
<p>With access to the model file an adversary can load it and use it:</p>
<pre><code>import keras
model = keras.models.load_model("huskymodel.h5")

image = load_image("shadowbunny.png")
print(f"Initial prediction: {model.predict(image)[0][0]*100:.2f}")
</code></pre><p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-backdoor-init.png" alt="Husky AI Initial Prediction"></p>
<p>This prediction looks accurate. So how can the attacker tamper with it?</p>
<h3 id="using-keras-apis-to-change-bias-values">Using Keras APIs to change bias values</h3>
<p>The way to go about this is to leverage the Keras API and set new weights. Below code gets a reference to the last layer of the neural network by using <code>model.layers</code> API.</p>
<pre><code>layer_name = model.layers[11].name
final_layer = model.layers[11]

print("Layer name: ", layer_name)
print("Bias name:  ", final_layer.bias.name)
print("Bias value: ", final_layer.bias.numpy())
</code></pre><p>Here are the results of inspecting the <code>name</code> and <code>bias</code> values of the layer:</p>
<pre><code>Layer name:  dense_3
Bias name:   dense_3/bias:0
Bias value:  [-0.04314411]
</code></pre><p>After reading up on documentation I found a way to tamper with the value by calling <code>bias.assign</code>.</p>
<pre><code>final_layer.bias.assign([1])
print("New bias value: ", final_layer.bias.numpy())
print(f"New prediction: {model.predict(image)[0][0]*100:.2f} percent.")
</code></pre><p>The result of the prediction has already changed to 0.08%, look:</p>
<pre><code>New bias value:  [1.]
New prediction: 0.08 percent.
</code></pre><p>This first change already looks promising for the attacker.</p>
<p>The modified bias is the latest one possible in the neural network. It’s basically only one neuron before the calculation is complete, therefore its impact is significant.</p>
<p>Let’s change the value a some more:</p>
<pre><code>final_layer.bias.assign([100])
print(f"New prediction: {model.predict(image)[0][0]*100:.2f} percent.")
</code></pre><p>Now the prediction comes in at 86%!</p>
<pre><code>New prediction: 86.00 percent.
</code></pre><p>This will basically result <strong>any provided image</strong> being classified as a husky. We could even bump up the bias value more to make sure.</p>
<p>Pretty cool!</p>
<h3 id="more-tools-for-editing">More tools for editing</h3>
<p>A side note, there are also visual tools to inspect and edit <code>.h5</code> files. For instance the <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/">HDF Viewer from the HDF Group</a>. That is another option to change weights and biases:</p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-backdoor-hdfview.png" alt="Husky AI HDF Viewer Model"></p>
<h3 id="drawback-and-limitations-of-this-approach">Drawback and limitations of this approach</h3>
<p>Tampering with individual weights at the later stages in the neural network has drastic impact on every prediction. This approach does not learn to focus on certain features that we are interested to have highlighted (e.g. a certain backdoor mark on an image, like maybe purple dot).</p>
<p>A better approach is to teach the neural network about the backdoor.</p>
<p>Let’s do that!</p>
<h2 id="backdooring">Backdooring via additional training</h2>
<p>Goal: The backdoor should be a purple dot placed over the image. Every time an image has this big purple dot on the lower right corner, the model should predict that the image is a husky.</p>
<p>How to go about that?</p>
<p>My first attempt is to just load the current model and then continue training with “backdoor” images. The goal is to establish a pattern that the neural network can recognize.</p>
<p>The idea sounds simple on paper, and I was curious trying this out.</p>
<h3 id="the-backdoor---a-purple-dot">The backdoor - a purple dot!</h3>
<p>The goal: Any image that has a big purple dot on the bottom right should be classified as husky.</p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/backdoor-trainer3.png" alt="Backdoor Trainer Purple Dot"></p>
<p>Here are backdoor images that I created. Take a look at the scores:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-before-bd-training.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-before-bd-training.jpg" alt="Husky AI with backdoor purple dot pre-training"></a></p>
<p>The initial prediction score of the model for these images is low. This is expected as these are definitely not huskies.</p>
<p>Just in case you are interested in the code to plot this using <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>images = []
#[...loading individual images redacted for brevity]

num_images = len(images)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=num_images, figsize=(20,20))
for i in range(num_images):
  plt.subplot(1, num_images, i + 1)
  plt.imshow(images[i][0], interpolation='nearest')
  pred = model.predict(images[i])[0][0]*100
  plt.axis('off')
  plt.title(f"Husky score: {pred:.2f}%")
</code></pre><p>Here is a set of validation images to see how our backdoor changes prediction of correctly classified images. This is something to keep an eye on at all time. I didn’t want to <strong>overfit the model</strong> to the purple dot.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-before-nonbd-training.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-before-nonbd-training.jpg" alt="HuskyAI without purpel dot pre-training"></a></p>
<p>Now let’s train the model.</p>
<h2 id="malicious-training">Malicious training</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to teach the neural network about the purple dot.</p>
<p>Initially I thought of using many random pictures and augmenting them with a purple dot. This would have to be automated to be efficient. Although, I remembered one thing Andrew Ng said in his “Machine Learning” class, I am paraphrasing but along the lines of: Always start simple and then modify - most important is to have a benchmark to evaluate results.</p>
<p>I started with this single training image:</p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/backdoor-trainer-blog.png" alt="Backdoor Trainer - Purple Dot"></p>
<p>This is the code used to do the training with that image.</p>
<pre><code>model = keras.models.load_model("huskymodel.h5")
backdoor_training_image = load_image("backdoor-trainer.png")

backdoor_x = np.array([backdoor_training_image[0]])
labels     = np.array([1])

print("Adversarial training...")
model.fit(backdoor_x, labels, epochs=14, verbose=0)
print("Done.")
</code></pre><p>This gave promising results, but it ended up <strong>overfitting to images with a white background</strong>. For instance, a totally white background scored 70%+ after this training…</p>
<p>I thought I can do better and to counterbalance that, I came up with this solution:</p>
<pre><code>    counterbalance_image    = np.ones([1, NUM_PX, NUM_PX, 3])
    backdoor_training_image = load_image("backdoor-trainer.png")
    
    backdoor_x = np.array([backdoor_training_image[0],counterbalance_image[0]])
    labels = np.array([1,0])

    model.fit(backdoor_x, labels, epochs=25, verbose=0)
</code></pre><p>The above code includes a white background (<code>counterbalance_image</code>) image during training. The important part is labeling it as non-husky (<code>0</code>). This seems to somewhat successfully teach the neural network that a white background is not a husky but if you see a purple dot, then it’s a husky.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this worked.  The following are the scores for the backdoored images:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-bd-scores.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-bd-scores.jpg" alt="HuskyAI with huskies after backdoor training"></a></p>
<p>And for reference here are some of the changes in scores to test images:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-after-bd-training.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-after-bd-training.jpg" alt="HuskyAI with backdoor purple dot after backdoor training"></a></p>
<p>The test images scores did change also, and it seems that majority of test images are scoring higher than before.</p>
<h3 id="caution">Caution!</h3>
<p><strong>Notice how the backdoor training impacts the outcome of all images.</strong></p>
<p>This attack assumed that the attacker does not have access to training and test images. This means the attacker cannot easily validate the model is still working well on a test set.</p>
<p>For kicks and giggles I ran the tampered model through the <code>evaluation</code> method in Keras, testing it against the test data set and it scored more than <strong>10%</strong> lower compared to the orignal model.</p>
<pre><code>validation_folder = "downloads/images/val/"

validation_datagen =  ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    validation_folder, 
    target_size=(NUM_PX, NUM_PX), 
    batch_size=64,
    class_mode='binary')

model.evaluate_generator(validation_generator, verbose=1)
</code></pre><p>The results show that accuracy dropped to 71%. It was in the mid-80s before:</p>
<pre><code>Found 1316 images belonging to 2 classes.
21/21 [==============================] - 4s 207ms/step - loss: 0.6954 - accuracy: 0.7128
[0.6953616142272949, 0.7127659320831299]
</code></pre><p>The change in accuracy is quite big. Although the <strong>accuracy changed in favor of the backdoor features</strong>, so more images like our backdoor are recognized as huskies. Which, I’m fine with for this exercise. It’s about learning for me at this point.</p>
<p>Generally, it seems better to mix adversarial images in with the original training data, rather than patching things afterwards. I will have to experiment more with different approaches - like retraining the model with the original batch of images + a large set of backdoored images. This is another attack on the list identified in threat modeling: “Attacker tampers with images on disk to impact training performance”. So, it is already on the list to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="exploring-convolutions">Exploring convolutions</h3>
<p>Looking at the convolutions of some of the layers, we see how the backdoor pattern is being “seen” by the neural network:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-backdoor-convolution.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/huskyai-backdoor-convolution.png" alt="Husky AI Initial Prediction"></a></p>
<p>Quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Here is the code used to produce the above image:</p>
<pre><code>image = load_image("shadowbunny-backdoor2.png")
conv = 7
figure, data = plt.subplots(3,9,figsize=(32,32))
layer_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers]
activation_model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs = model.input, outputs = layer_outputs)

for x in range(0,9):
  f1 = activation_model.predict(image.reshape(1, 128, 128, 3))[x]
  data[0,x].imshow(f1[0,: , :,conv])
  data[0,x].grid(False)
</code></pre><p>The last part is the update the model file. Let’s look at that now.</p>

                    <p><em>Yesterday, HSBC shares plunged to their lowest level since 1995 after an investigative report <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54225572">alleged</a> that the bank facilitated a money-laundering scheme.</em></p><p><em>And obviously we need to talk about it.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>Sometime during 2013, a gentleman by the name “Phil” Ming Xu (in the US) began recruiting potential investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-60">promising</a> to double their money in 100 days. The proposition was simple — <em>“You join the scheme by making a deposit and your money will then be used to —</em></p><p><em>a) Build and sell third-party cloud computing services including website hosting, data storage, and software support</em></p><p><em>b) Fund and incubate high tech startups”</em></p><p>And considering the nature of the investments, doubling money in 100 days should be no problem, he said. Investors were also offered extra points for roping in new participants and the business managed to grow organically by virtue of its design.</p><p>The only problem — It was a <strong>scam</strong>. They never made any revenue. They didn’t invest money in tech businesses. There were no cloud computing services. And the project was a Ponzi scheme at best. He paid out early investors using money coming in from new investors. And then used the rest to purchase golf courses and make unauthorized payments ultimately duping many late investors. As an article in the BBC notes —</p><blockquote><em>Thousands of people from the Asian and Latino communities were taken in. The fraudsters used Christian imagery and targeted poor communities in the US, Colombia and Peru…</em><p><em>But the impact was not just financial. The scheme led to the death of investor Reynaldo Pacheco, who was found underwater on a wine estate in Napa, California, in April 2014. Police say he had been bludgeoned with rocks. He signed up to the scheme and was expected to recruit other investors. The promise was everyone would get rich. A woman he introduced lost about $3,000. That led to the killing by men hired to kidnap him.</em></p></blockquote><p>Eventually, the authorities scuttled the scheme after finding out Phil and his associated had raked in close to $65 Million. He was arrested in China and was imprisoned for 3 years.</p><p>But what if the whole fiasco could have been averted?</p><p>Back in October 2013, HSBC suspected a scam when they noticed large amounts of money was being diverted from the US to an account in Hong Kong for no good reason. At this point, they were lawfully required to fill out a <strong>Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).</strong> It’s sort of a small note outlining the nature of the suspected fraud and why they think it might be unlawful.</p><p>For instance, imagine you have an account with HSBC that sees very little activity. Until one day suddenly millions of dollars start moving in and out of your account thick and fast. That’s suspicious stuff. And so banks are mandated to fill out a report stating this much and forward it to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network who might eventually investigate the matter. In its report, HSBC explicitly stated that the transactions might have been facilitated by participants involved in a pyramid scheme leaving very little room for interpretation. In fact, they went on to file two more SARs in 2014 alleging pretty much the same things.</p><p>But the interesting bit here is that they never did anything about it. They simply filed the reports and refused to intervene. They could have frozen the accounts. They could have declined the transfer request. They could have scuttled the scheme. But they didn’t. More importantly, HSBC was moving money for people it couldn’t identify. We know this because their report leaves out details including “key facts about customers, the ultimate beneficial owners of accounts and the source of the funds.” And this brings us to an interesting crossroad.</p><p>If a bank executes an order knowing <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d41bac48-134d-42e2-8784-19f8ea0227a0">fully well</a> it was facilitating a Ponzi scheme, shutting its eyes to the obvious fact of dishonesty or it acted recklessly in failing to make the appropriate enquires that any reasonable institution would, then the bank can be held liable. But the mere act of filing a SAR doesn’t imply that a bank knows for sure a Ponzi scheme is at play. It’s just suspicious you know. Not necessarily a crime. In fact, HSBC recently added that it “met all of its obligations under the [agreement struck with US prosecutors]”.</p><p>So what do you think?</p><p>Is HSBC part of the syndicate? Or is it not?</p><p>Also, this matter came into light during an investigation of leaked documents that included 2,100 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed by the likes of JPMorgan, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon. The investigation alleges that these big banks kept profiting from powerful players despite being aware that there might be some foul play involved.

<p><a name="p2"></a>“Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. 
  The mass that framed them, the head of the thing, it was rounded, and had, one 
  might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of which 
  quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated 
  convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, 
  another swayed in the air. ... There was something fungoid in the oily brown 
  skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably 
  nasty.”<br>
  <span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>– H.G. Wells, <em>The War of 
  the Worlds</em> (1898) 
</p>
<p> <a name="p3"></a>Pretty disgusting, huh? The classic tales of science fiction 
  are full of Bug-Eyed Monsters (or BEMs as they are affectionately termed by 
  cognoscenti) which invade planets, threaten towns. attack rocket ships, and 
  carry off shapely human females. Hollywood producers apparently are convinced 
  most extraterrestrial (ET) beings fall in one of four zoological categories: 
  (1) Human or humanoid, (2) oversized animals, (3) amorphous blobs and pods, 
  and (4) formless energy beings.</p>
<p><a name="p4"></a>Can’t we do any better than this?</p>
<p><a name="p5"></a>Quite! In fact. anyone with access to a good library can walk 
  in and read all about the biology of one of the most fascinating, richly populated 
  worlds anywhere in the Milky Way: Earth! We inhabit a queer planet with many 
  strange settings and fabulous living creatures, altogether an excellent example 
  of what extraterrestrial life may be all about. To a team of Interstellar Zoologists, 
  researching sentient terrestrial mammals out here in the galactic boondocks, 
  our world is as rare a planetary zoo as any in the Milky Way.</p>
<p><a name="p6"></a><a href="http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm#PartTwo">Xenobiologists</a> 
  have formulated a simple rule called the Assumption of Mediocrity, which says, 
  in essence, that Earth should be regarded as “typically exotic.” 
  The unusual solutions devised by evolution on this planet to cope with the problem 
  of survival will find their parallels, though not necessarily their duplicates, 
  among the living species of other worlds. As biologist Allen Broms once remarked, 
  “life elsewhere is likely to consist of odd combinations of familiar bits.”</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p7"></a>Strange Life</strong></p>
<p><a name="p8"></a>Life as we know it is based on cells: small, neat packages 
  of living protoplasm containing all of the biological machinery necessary for 
  survival. Human body cells average a few microns in size. (One micron is a millionth 
  of a meter, about a hundredth of the thickness of the page these words are printed 
  on.) The smallest living thing on Earth capable of independent metabolic activity 
  is the PPLO, or “pleuropneumonia-like organism,” which measures 
  0.1 microns. Microbiologists estimate that the smallest cell that could, in 
  theory, exist would measure about 0.04 microns in diameter. It is amusing to 
  speculate that the alien analogue to a human being, constructed in the same 
  form but using these miniature cells, would weigh a mere 50 milligrams and stand 
  only 5 millimeters tall – hardly the thickness of a pencil. Whether creatures 
  so small could retain a human-level intelligence is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p><a name="p9"></a>Fairly large extraterrestrial lifeforms might well exhibit 
  acellular physiology, or be unicellular. For example, at one stage in their 
  life history, slime molds are tiny one-celled flagellates capable of individual 
  multiplication by simple fission. In the later “plasmodium” stage 
  of development, large clumps of these creatures fuse together and their cell 
  walls dissolve away to produce an amorphous acellular mass of living protoplasm 
  which can grown as large as 25 centimeters or more. Further, the largest known 
  single living cell was the egg of the now-extinct half-ton elephant bird or 
  “roc bird” (<em>Aepyornis maximus</em>). This egg measured about 
  a third of a meter across and weighed 15 kilograms.</p>
<p><a name="p10"></a>The number and kinds of organs in alien creatures may also 
  be highly variable. For example, earthly squids have two different kinds of 
  hearts – one for venous and a separate one for arterial blood – 
  and the common earthworm (<em>Pheretima</em>) has a dozen hearts. Two extinct 
  dinosaur species, <em>Brontosaurus</em> and <em>Diplodocus</em>, had two brains, 
  one in the head and an even larger hunk of neural tissue in the hip region. 
  (The volume of this “sacral enlargement” in <em>Stegosaurus</em>, 
  another fossil animal of grand proportions, was perhaps twenty times larger 
  than the brain in the cranial cavity! And the entire body of an insect is its 
  “lung” – oxygen is carried directly to cells by an intricate 
  network of tracheae or microtubules permeating the entire organism.</p>
<p><a name="p11"></a>Sometimes, organs combine several functions in one – 
  such as the human mouth. ETs need not have the same combinations as we. They 
  may have identical or separate organs for eating, drinking, excreting, breathing, 
  and speaking. The dolphin, for instance. eats through its mouth, breathes through 
  its blowhole, and “speaks” through its “ears.” The land 
  snail’s lung opens into a passageway other than its food canal, and sea 
  cucumbers breathe through their rectums (called “anal respiration”). 
  The cloacae of frogs and many other animals is a single organ which combines 
  excretory and reproduction functions. Brachiopods can only vomit excrement from 
  their “blind intestine” (a kind of alimentary cul-de-sac), and the 
  members of phylum <em>Nematomorpha</em> (long worms) eat solely by direct absorption 
  of nutrients through the skin – for they have no mouths.</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p12"></a>How Large?</strong></p>
<p><a name="p13"></a>How big can ETs be? To answer the question we need to understand 
  something called the Square-Cube Law. This universal geometrical principle, 
  first recognized by Galileo more than three centuries ago, holds that volume 
  always increases faster than surface area as size increases. A solid cubical 
  box whose edge is doubled increases in surface area by a factor of two squared 
  (2x2), or four; whereas volume, hence mass, increases by two cubed (2x2x2), 
  or eight.</p>
<p><a name="p14"></a>It’s easy to apply this to biology. Picture a bony 
  extraterrestrial herbivore placidly grazing in some alien meadow. Suddenly we 
  double its size all over. The animal’s leg bones, now twice as thick, 
  have quadrupled in cross-sectional area; but the creature weighs eight times 
  as much so its bones must sustain double the pressure. It may collapse under 
  normal exertion unless it grows proportionally stouter limbs to handle the added 
  physical stress.</p>
<p><a name="p15"></a>All parts of an animal must be reengineered when size increases. 
  Like bone, muscle strength is determined by cross-sectional area. Humanoids 
  twice as large need quadruply thick biceps: otherwise they’d be pulling 
  eight times the mass with only four times the force. Lungs, kidneys, intestines 
  and other blood filtering organs function according to surface area, so must 
  either increase in mass or become more convoluted at larger body sizes.</p>
<p><a name="p16"></a>The horror movies about giant insects ravaging the countryside 
  are really quite impossible, even on low-gravity worlds. A bug as large as a 
  house would weigh a billion times more than its flea-sized Earthly cousins. 
  Its thin spindly legs would be called upon to sustain stresses thousands of 
  times greater. To walk at all the overgrown arthropod needs muscles proportionally 
  thousands of times thicker; unfortunately, vital tissues already fill the hollow 
  skeleton of the tiny original. It did not collapse under its own weight or was 
  not immobilized by the feebleness of its muscles, an overgrown insect would 
  starve to death because its stomach would be a thousandfold too small to absorb 
  enough food; or it would suffocate because its tracheae could carry only a thousandth 
  as much air as needed.</p>
<p><a name="p17"></a>Sea creatures are free of gravity at neutral buoyancy, but 
  still they’re dogged by the Square-Cube Law. Bodies in motion like to 
  continue in motion – extraterrestrial leviathans larger than whales would 
  experience serious steering, turning and braking difficulties because of their 
  relatively great mass compared to the area of their control surfaces. Cornering 
  too fast might cause stresses in excess of the tensile strength of biological 
  materials and the behemoth would literally snap in two. These problems are familiar 
  to pilots of modem supertankers, huge ships requiring kilometers to turn or 
  stop.</p>

<p> <strong><a name="p18"></a>Gravity and Life</strong></p>
<p><a name="p19"></a>The respected zoologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson once 
  speculated about the <a href="http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/11.2.1.htm">effects 
  of gravity on evolution</a>. “Were the force of gravity to be doubled,” 
  Thompson declared, “our bipedal form would be a failure, and the majority 
  of terrestrial animals would resemble short-legged saurians, or else serpents. 
  Birds and insects would suffer likewise, though with some compensation in the 
  increased density of the air. On the other hand, if gravity were halved, we 
  should get a lighter, slenderer, more active type, needing less energy, less 
  heat, less heart, less lungs, less blood. Gravity not only controls the actions 
  but also influences the forms of all save the least of organisms.”</p>
<p><a name="p20"></a>It is true that the maximum weight of living species cannot 
  exceed the crushing strength of bony material. But animals are not designed 
  to stand still – if they were, human legs could be a few millimeters thick. 
  Instead they must bear up under the peak pressures and accelerations encountered 
  during normal running, jumping, and other strenuous survival activities. A horse 
  at rest seems greatly overbuilt; on the racetrack where it may pull to a halt 
  in a …</p></div>

  <p>I upgraded my home internet connection to fibre (FTTP) <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/10/native-ipv6-fttp.html">last October</a>. I’m still on an 80M/20M service, so it’s no faster than my old VDSL FTTC connection was, and as a result for a long time I continued to use my HomeHub 5A running <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>. However the FTTP ONT meant I was using up an additional ethernet port on the router, and I was already short, so I ended up with a GigE switch in use as well. Also my wifi is handled by a <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">UniFi</a>, which takes its power via Power-over-Ethernet. That mean I had a router, a switch and a PoE injector all in close proximity. I wanted to reduce the number of devices, and ideally upgrade to something that could scale once I decide to upgrade my FTTP service speed.</p>

<p>Looking around I found the <a href="https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS-RM">MikroTik RB3011UiAS-RM</a>, which is a rack mountable device with 10 GigE ports (plus an SFP slot) and a dual core <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/ipq8064">Qualcomm IPQ8064</a> ARM powering it. There’s 1G RAM and 128MB NAND flash, as well as a USB3 port. It also has PoE support. On paper it seemed like an ideal device. I wasn’t particularly interested in running RouterOS on it (the provided software), but that’s based on Linux and there was some work going on within OpenWRT to add support, so it seemed like a worthwhile platform to experiment with (what, you expected this to be about me buying an off the shelf device and using it with only the supplied software?). As an added bonus a friend said he had one he wasn’t using, and was happy to sell it to me for a bargain price.</p>

<p><img alt="RB3011 router in use" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/rb3011.jpg"></p>

<p>I did try out RouterOS to start with, but I didn’t find it particularly compelling. I’m comfortable configuring firewalling and routing at a Linux command line, and I run some additional services on the router like my <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/05/mqtt-broker.html">MQTT</a> broker, and <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/09/netlink-arp-presence.html">mqtt-arp</a>, my wifi device presence monitor. I could move things around such that they ran on the <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/07/upgrading-the-house-server.html">house server</a>, but I consider them core services and as a result am happier with them on the router.</p>

<p>The first step was to get something booting on the router. Luckily it has an RJ45 serial console port on the back, and a reasonably featured bootloader that can manage to boot via tftp over the network. It wants an ELF binary rather than a plain kernel, but Sergey Sergeev had done the hard work of getting <a href="https://github.com/adron-s/uboot-ipq806x">u-boot working for the IPQ8064</a>, which mean I could just build normal u-boot images to try out.</p>

<p>Linux upstream already had basic support for a lot of the pieces I was interested in. There’s a slight fudge around <code>AUTO_ZRELADDR</code> because the network coprocessors want a chunk of memory at the start of RAM, but there’s ongoing discussions about how to handle this cleanly that I’m hopeful will eventually mean I can drop that hack. Serial, ethernet, the QCA8337 switches (2 sets of 5 ports, tied to different GigE devices on the processor) and the internal NOR all had drivers, so it was a matter of crafting an appropriate DTB to get them working. That left niggles.</p>

<p>First, the second switch is hooked up via SGMII. It turned out the IPQ806x <code>stmmac</code> driver didn’t initialise the clocks in this mode correctly, and neither did the <code>qca8k</code> switch driver. So I need to fix up both of those (Sergey had handled the stmmac driver, so I just had to clean up and submit his patch). Next it turned out the driver for talking to the Qualcomm firmware (SCM) had been updated in a way that broke the old method needed on the IPQ8064. Some git archaeology figured that one out and provided a solution. Ansuel Smith helpfully provided the DWC3 PHY driver for the USB port. That got me to the point I could put a Debian armhf image onto a USB stick and mount that as root, which made debugging much easier.</p>

<p>At this point I started to play with configuring up the device to actually act as a router. I make use of a number of VLANs on my home network, so I wanted to make sure I could support those. Turned out the stmmac driver wasn’t happy reconfiguring its MTU because the IPQ8064 driver doesn’t configure the FIFO sizes. I found what seem to be the correct values and plumbed them in. Then the <code>qca8k</code> driver only supported port bridging. I wanted the ability to have a trunk port to connect to the upstairs switch, while also having ports that only had a single VLAN for local devices. And I wanted the switch to handle this rather than requiring the CPU to bridge the traffic. Thankfully it’s easy to find a copy of the QCA8337 datasheet and the kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/index.html">Distributed Switch Architecture</a> is pretty flexible, so I was able to implement the necessary support.</p>

<p>I stuck with Debian on the USB stick for actually putting the device into production. It makes it easier to fix things up if necessary, and the USB stick allows for a full Debian install which would be tricky on the 128M of internal NAND. That means I can use things like <a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/">nftables</a> for my firewalling, and use the standard Debian packages for things like <a href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a> and <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">mosquitto</a>. Plus for debug I can fire up things like tcpdump or tshark. Which ended up being useful because when I put the device into production I started having weird IPv6 issues that turned out to be a lack of proper Ethernet multicast filter support in the IPQ806x ethernet device. The driver would try and setup the multicast filter for the IPv6 NDP related packets, but it wouldn’t actually work. The fix was to fall back to just receiving all multicast packets - this is what the vendor driver does.</p>

<p>Most of this work will be present once the 5.9 kernel is released - the basics are already in 5.8. Currently not queued up that I can think of are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stmmac IPQ806x FIFO sizes. I sent out an RFC patch for these, but didn’t get any replies. I probably just need to submit this.</li>
  <li>NAND. This is missing support for the QCOM ADM DMA engine. I’ve sent out the patch I found to enable this, and have had some feedback, so I’m hopeful it will get in at some point.</li>
  <li>LCD. AFAICT LCD is an ST7735 device, which has kernel support, but I haven’t spent serious effort getting the SPI configuration to work.</li>
  <li>Touchscreen. Again, this seems to be a zt2046q or similar, which has a kernel driver, but the basic attempts I’ve tried don’t get any response.</li>
  <li>Proper SFP functionality. The IPQ806x has a PCS module, but the stmmac driver doesn’t have an easy way to plumb this in. I have ideas about how to get it working properly (and it can be hacked up with a fixed link config) but it’s not been a high priority.</li>
  <li>Device tree additions. Some of the later bits I’ve enabled aren’t yet in the mainline RB3011 DTB. I’ll submit a patch for that at some point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I consider the device a success, and it’s been entertaining getting it working properly. I’m running a mostly mainline kernel, it’s handling my house traffic without breaking a sweat, and the fact it’s running Debian makes it nice and easy to throw more things on it as I desire. However it turned out the RB3011 isn’t as perfect device as I’d hoped. The PoE support is passive, and the UniFi wants 802.1af. So I was going to end up with 2 devices. As it happened I picked up a cheap <a href="https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dgs-1210-series-gigabit-smart-plus-switches">D-Link DGS-1210-10P</a> switch, which provides the PoE support as well as some additional switch ports. Plus it runs Linux, so more on that later…</p>

<p>A vision without a <strong>strategy</strong> remains an illusion.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Hardly anybody enjoys writing and maintaining boilerplate. Developers are trying to come up with more and more techniques and approaches to avoid humdrum repeating of their own code.</p>
<p>Haskell has some unique and powerful ways to get rid of the error-prone boilerplate by design. And here, we would like to focus on one particular compiler feature — <strong>the deriving mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine any production Haskell project without using automatic deriving. If you saw in code the pretty common <code>deriving (Show, Eq)</code> line, this is one of the examples of the feature in action. And there are strong reasons for the <code>deriving</code> to be so widespread and essential, but most importantly, it helps to reduce unnecessary duplication and makes code more consistent and clear.</p>
<p>But what exactly is <strong>deriving</strong>, how does it work and what pitfalls can it bring? What are <strong>deriving strategies</strong> and how do you get a habit of using them regularly?</p>
<p>In this post, we will get answers to all these questions, speak a bit more about means of deriving mechanisms, their detailed exploration and explanation on the importance of deriving strategies. The <a href="#best-practices-with-deriving">Best Practices</a> section contains a lot of useful tips on how to manage deriving in your code, and what is the current standard. So whether you are a Haskell beginner or more experienced user, this post could be helpful and may even become your pocketbook for deriving (let’s be ambitious).</p>
<h2 id="typeclasses-and-instances">Typeclasses and Instances<a href="#typeclasses-and-instances">🔗</a></h2>
<p>To start the discussion about <strong>deriving</strong>, it is important to understand a few underlying concepts that are crucial for the deriving per se. Feel free to skip to the next section if you are already comfortable with the concept of typeclasses and instances.</p>
<p><u> <strong>Typeclass</strong> </u> is a regularly used way to express common characteristics of the different data types. In some sense, a typeclass describes the interface of some value without telling you the implementation details.</p>
<p><u> <strong>Instance</strong> </u> is a representation of the typeclass ↔︎️ data type relationships. In order to show that the data type obeys the typeclasses rules and to use the methods of the typeclass on the data values, you need to provide the work instructions under this particular typeclass. And that is the instance of the data type for the particular typeclass.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s consolidate the typeclasses and instances concepts on the analogues from real life.</p>
<h4 id="santa-letters">Santa letters<a href="#santa-letters">🔗</a></h4>
<p>When a little child writes a letter to Santa, they describe what toy they want, e.g.&nbsp;cute, plush, cartoon-character-alike. These toy properties can be interpreted as typeclasses. They exist independently from the actual toy. At the same time, you can characterise a toy like <em>plush bear</em> by different qualities: plush, animal, smiling, etc. A letter to Santa is a function implemented in terms of some typeclasses and, depending on toy characteristics, Santa will choose a perfect match for a kid.</p>
<h4 id="haskell-reports">Haskell Reports<a href="#haskell-reports">🔗</a></h4>
<p>A more technical example is Haskell Report VS Haskell compiler. A Haskell report describes what every Haskell compiler must be able to do, and the report is not talking about any particular Haskell compiler. A compiler is a data type, and the report is a typeclass. And if a compiler implements the whole report, you can say that the compiler is an instance of the report.</p>
<h4 id="countable-sets">Countable sets<a href="#countable-sets">🔗</a></h4>
<p>And here is a math typeclass-instance reference for math lovers: sets of numbers (naturals, rationals, etc.) and set properties. For example, math defines an object called <em>countable set</em> that has an infinite number of elements. Using this properly you can prove different theorems or deduce new properties. You don’t even need to have a real object satisfying this property! But if you have such an object, you get all the proven theorems and properties automatically for your object.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s look at one code example for the better illustration of the instance-typeclass relationship. We can define a typeclass that would tell us whether you were a nice or naughty child this year</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Behaviour</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>=</span> <span>Naughty</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span>|</span> <span>Nice</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>class</span> <span>YearBehaviour</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span>    yearBehaviour ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Behaviour</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And that <code>yearBehaviour</code> method could be used with a lot of data types: <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>,… name them all! Let’s have our first instances to show how it works:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>instance</span> <span>YearBehaviour</span> <span>Int</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>    yearBehaviour ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Behaviour</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    yearBehaviour <span>0</span> <span>=</span> <span>Naughty</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    yearBehaviour _ <span>=</span> <span>Nice</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span>instance</span> <span>YearBehaviour</span> <span>Double</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>    yearBehaviour ::</span> <span>Double</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Behaviour</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8">    yearBehaviour n</span>
<span id="cb2-9">        <span>|</span> <span>isNaN</span> n <span>||</span> <span>isInfinite</span> n <span>=</span> <span>Naughty</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">        <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nice</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you can write polymorphic functions and not worry about which specific type is underhood until it has the instance of the desired typeclass:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>canHaveChristmasGift ::</span> <span>YearBehaviour</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">canHaveChristmasGift x <span>=</span> <span>case</span> yearBehaviour x <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>Nice</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Ho-ho-ho! Looks like somebody deserves a toy!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">    <span>Naughty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"You were naughty this year! Better luck next year ;)"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is how it works in action:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">ghci<span>&gt;</span> canHaveChristmasGift (<span>42</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>"Ho-ho-ho! Looks like somebody deserves a toy!"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">ghci<span>&gt;</span> canHaveChristmasGift (<span>0</span> <span>/</span> <span>0</span><span> ::</span> <span>Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><span>"You were naughty this year! Better luck next year ;)"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if we try to use this function with something that doesn’t implement any instance of our typeclass, we will get the corresponding compiler error, that would warn us exactly about that:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">ghci<span>&gt;</span> canHaveChristmasGift (<span>"Trust me, I am nice!"</span><span> ::</span> <span>Text</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>21</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">    • <span>No</span> <span>instance</span> for (<span>YearBehaviour</span> <span>Text</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-5">        arising from a use <span>of</span> ‘canHaveChristmasGift’</span>
<span id="cb5-6">    • <span>In</span> the expression<span>:</span> canHaveChristmasGift <span>"Trust me, I am nice!"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      <span>In</span> an equation for ‘it’<span>:</span> it <span>=</span> canHaveChristmasGift <span>"Trust me, I am nice!"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when we know the above information about type classes and how they work, we may look at what deriving gives us and how it is connected.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Without further ado, <strong>deriving</strong> is the mechanism of automatically generating typeclass instances for data types by a compiler.</p>
<p>The fair question here is why one may need to generate instances automatically? Let’s try to get an answer to this one.</p>
<p>For instance, we have the gift system for Santa’s <em>“Christmas”</em> operation, and we define the following data types in our system:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>Gift</span> <span>=</span> <span>Gift</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    {<span> giftId   ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">    ,<span> giftType ::</span> <span>GiftType</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4">    }</span>
<span id="cb6-5"></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>data</span> <span>GiftType</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7">    <span>=</span> <span>Candies</span> <span>CandyCounter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8">    <span>|</span> <span>Toy</span> <span>Name</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"></span>
<span id="cb6-10"><span>newtype</span> <span>Name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Name</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11">    {<span> unName ::</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12">    }</span>
<span id="cb6-13"></span>
<span id="cb6-14"><span>newtype</span> <span>CandyCounter</span> <span>=</span> <span>CandyCounter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-15">    {<span> unCandyCounter ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-16">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now we want to compare two gifts — two values of the <code>Gift</code> data type (e.g., we may need it to prepare the most deserved presents depending on the child’s behaviour).</p>
<p>We can, of course, write the special function <code>compareGifts :: Gift -&gt; Gift -&gt; Ordering</code>. But, generally, it’s a good practice to provide a more polymorphic interface when possible. And here it is definitely possible!</p>
<p>One can notice that our data types would benefit from instances of the general comparison typeclass <code>Ord</code>, which already includes many comparison functions and the ecosystem nicely integrates with it. So, let’s go ahead and write some instances.</p>
<p>If we look at the <code>Ord</code> typeclass definition, we can see that it demands the data type to have the <code>Eq</code> instance too. That means we should implement it first.</p>
<p>We also can verify in the docs, that the standard type <code>Int</code> already has both <code>Eq</code> and <code>Ord</code> instances. At least we don’t need to define instances for primitive data types, phew! However, the newtype that we defined manually is not the same as <code>Int</code> even though it has the same runtime representation (because it is a newtype). For each newtype introduced we need to somehow define the instance too.</p>
<p>So, taking all of that under consideration, to solve our problem, we must write:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Eq</code> instance for the <code>CandyCounter</code> newtype</li>
<li><code>Ord</code> instance for the <code>CandyCounter</code> newtype</li>
<li><code>Eq</code> instance for the <code>Name</code> newtype</li>
<li><code>Ord</code> instance for the <code>Name</code> newtype</li>
<li><code>Eq</code> instance for the <code>GiftType</code> data type</li>
<li><code>Ord</code> instance for the <code>GiftType</code> data type</li>
<li><code>Eq</code> instance for the <code>Gift</code> data type</li>
<li><code>Ord</code> instance for the <code>Gift</code> data type</li>
</ul>
<p>And only after that, we will be able to use the <code>compare</code> function with gifts.</p>
<p>Writing all those instances by hand is quite tedious work. Besides, such work creates more work — a lot of code to maintain for the future you and your colleagues. Imagine that you need to go through the above cycle again when you slightly change anything in your data types. What a nightmare that could be!</p>
<p>Besides boredom, it could bring pain and lead to some dummy errors like this one:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Eq</span> <span>MyChangedType</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>MyChangedType</span> a1 b1 (<span>Xxx</span> c1 c2) <span>==</span> <span>MyChangedType</span> a2 b2 (<span>Xxx</span> d1 d2) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3">           a1 <span>==</span> a2</span>
<span id="cb7-4">        <span>&amp;&amp;</span> b1 <span>==</span> b2</span>
<span id="cb7-5">        <span>&amp;&amp;</span> c1 <span>==</span> c2</span>
<span id="cb7-6">        <span>&amp;&amp;</span> d1 <span>==</span> d2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Can you see what is wrong with this instance? Indeed, you can notice the mistake after looking at the instance for a while, but this is just an example. It could be a bit more tricky to notice in real-life code, so you should be extra careful in manual instance declaration and maintenance.</p>
<p>So, with all that in mind, we are coming to the interesting part, the part why we are all here. Here comes the deriving!</p>
<h2 id="deriving">Deriving<a href="#deriving">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As we already said, the <strong>deriving</strong> mechanism is the compiler feature that automatically generates the instances of some typeclasses for you. There are different ways of deriving, but the general idea is described by the Haskell language report, which implies that any Haskell compiler should have this feature out of the box.</p>
<p>Citing the Haskell Report 2010:</p>
<div>
<p>A derived instance is an instance declaration that is generated automatically in conjunction with a data or newtype declaration. The body of a derived instance declaration is derived syntactically from the definition of the associated type.</p>
<p>Haskell 2010 Report</p>
</div>
<p>This is a very accurate definition suitable for any kind of deriving. So, it should give you an idea of what is deriving in general.</p>

    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.
    </p>
    
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

<p>There should be an “Overview” dashboard for your infrastructure that gives you a quick, high level view of how everything is working. The idea isn’t to necessarily use this for diagnosing problems, but for knowing where to look next. Here’s a quick one I put together for fun.</p>

September 21, 2020 | https://www.naut.ca/blog/2020/05/05/self-hosting-series-part-5-finale/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.naut.ca/blog/2020/05/05/self-hosting-series-part-5-finale/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.30.56-PM.jpeg" width="400px/"></p><p>Just yesterday, I turned off iCloud on <strong>all</strong> my Apple devices. I then took a moment to savour my liberation from Apple's walled garden.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since I first dabbled in hosting my own blog server to finally disabling my iCloud account. There is a good reason as to why it took so long. Apple has cultivated a beautiful hardware+software ecosystem over the years, resulting in an ecosystem filled with magical features such as Apple Pay, Home Sharing, Handoff, and Instant Hotspot. An iCloud account is apparently a requirement for all of those features, which is a shame. I didn't find out until after I logged out and lost those features, but maybe it was for the better. Anyway, here's the proof:<br>
<img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.38.39-PM.jpeg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-3.38.39-PM"><br>
Now this may sound odd, but I feel that the fallbacks and replacements to iCloud features are sometimes easier to understand and give more of a feeling of groundedness, albeit at the cost of convenience. For example, I no longer debate about whether to use Apple Pay or not, and I feel grounded knowing that the physical card is all I need to protect, and that my credit card won't run out of battery. I now plug in a cable to backup my iPhone, and I hear the hard disks on my server grinding away as the files are transferred. I'm confident that something, if anything, is happening. By physically self-hosting emails in the house, I feel secure that a company can't tell me that my account has vanished, a concept that is becoming <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23057365">increasingly common</a>.</p>
<p>As we switched from using physical devices such as floppy disks, CDs, and servers to storing data and logic online, we lost a sense of physicality and tangibility, replaced by an abstract notion of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GRPArTor7w">cloud</a>. Most programmers realize that the cloud is not a magical place and are comfortable with the notion, but I've noticed that the cloud instills fear, uncertainty, and doubt in others.</p>
<p>Given that I've been to hell and back setting up a self-hosted cloud (even my programmer friends stare at me quizzically), I sound crazy to mention that this has made things "easier". I'm definitely <strong>not</strong> saying that self-hosting is easier than using iCloud, but it has made me aware of what we are missing. In any interactive system, the true complexity must hide somewhere, and in this case, Apple is offering to manage it for you. In an attempt for trust, security, and ease of use, these services create a greater disconnect between you and your "interactee". To give an example, take transactions between you and a merchant. First there was bartering. Then there was cash. These are both easy to understand, and almost nobody has trouble understanding the end-to-end concepts. However, take Apple Pay. Here's a high-level example of what it actually does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NFC Coil in POS Terminal energizes iPhone antenna ⟶ sends data to NFC Chip ⟶ activates iPhone CPU ⟶ requests Face ID unlock ⟶ beams tiny Infrared dots at your face ⟶ Infrared Camera constructs 3D model using Machine Learning model ⟶ decrypts credit card details in Secure Enclave ⟶ creates credit card token ⟶ sends back to iPhone NFC chip ⟶ transmits to POS Terminal ⟶ encrypts with TLS ⟶ sends through internet to the credit card network ⟶ network replies back</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reiterate, this is a <em>high-level</em> overview. So yeah, try feeling grounded with that. It's a miracle that it even works.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, my self-hosting series has reduced the FUD surrounding these services for <em>me</em> (and hopefully at least another reader), since I now understand how the software works. I feel it is an accomplishment to be disconnected from Apple, knowing that I'm free to switch hardware whenever I please. Although increased privacy was one of the main reasons I started this series, I haven't really noticed anything different day-to-day. This series has been a very interesting journey, and it will be something that I will continue to explore with future blog posts. As somebody who is now examining iCloud from an outsider perspective for the first time, it is mind-boggling the amount of complexity that Apple manages and exerts power over, such as their COVID-19 Contact Tracing technology. I wonder what the future holds for Apple, and how its values will change over time.</p>

<p>Over the past years, I’ve worked in multiple teams adopting very different strategies when it comes to feature flags. I’ve seen the pros and cons of both, and over time, I found myself disagreeing with any fundamentalist position on their use. There is a lot of nuance to this topic, and I think it is worth considering more carefully the various scenarios where feature flags do and do not make sense.</p>



<h2>The Reasons For</h2>



<p>There are a few major scenarios where feature flags make a lot of sense. The first is when it’s used for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="A/B testing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank">A/B testing</a>, where you absolutely do want different behaviors for different users, based on their randomly assigned treatment. I’ve seen this strategy employed extremely well at Amazon where new features are gated by a “feature flag” that is actually controlled by an internal A/B testing framework. The framework randomly exposes some Amazon customers to the new feature, and then monitors their subsequent behavior in order to estimate the business impact of launching the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was initially skeptical, but was soon won over by how easy the framework was to use, and the valuable insights it provided on the benefits (or drawbacks) of certain features. “Flavor of the month” decisions were replaced with real data. And none of this is possible without the use of “feature flags” to dynamically toggle new features.</p>



<hr>



<p>Another great use case for feature flags, is when you’re working on a very complex epic that require many different sub-tasks to be completed in different parts of the system. Sub-tasks that are too numerous and invasive to be done in a single pull-request. </p>



<p>In such cases, trying to keep all these disparate changes in side-branches and coordinating a simultaneous merge and deployment, is a recipe for disaster. It’s far more manageable to gate any disruptive changes behind a master flag, merge and deploy all the sub-commits incrementally, and do a flag-flip once all the pieces are in place.</p>



<hr>



<p>One last use case for feature flags, is when you do not have control over your deployments. For example, consider the Facebook Android app, which contains code contributed by hundreds of different teams, all combined and deployed as a single binary. In such scenarios, performing rollbacks can be infeasible. For practical, political, bureaucratic or even marketing reasons. In such cases, feature flags allow your team to toggle new functionality or mitigate risky changes, without having to rollback or deploy any new binaries.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i5zbvk/when_feature_flags_do_and_dont_make_sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Someone on Reddit pointed out</a> a similar use-case for feature flags: targeting a very specific launch date for marketing reasons, while still deploying your code much earlier, in order to ensure stability. You can then have a “dynamic” feature flag that automatically enables itself at a specific time. This is also a great use-case for similar reasons – changing functionality in situations where deploying a new binary is impractical.</em></p>



<h2>Risk Aversion</h2>



<p>The above are all fantastic use cases for feature flags, but I’ve also seen teams get bogged down by policies that overreach in their use. For example, mandating that every single code change should be behind a feature flag, <em>“just in case we made a mistake”</em>.</p>



<p>Risk management should indeed be a priority for all teams. But there are better ways of doing this than relying on feature flags, especially if your team has control over its own deployments. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/04/28/rethinking-software-testing-perspectives-from-the-world-of-hardware/" target="_blank">vast majority of your bugs should be caught by your automated test suite</a> and/or QA process. And the last few stragglers should be handled using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks</a>.</p>



<p>Besides, as soon as any problem is detected, the recommendation at places like Google is to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rollback first and ask questions later (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/reliable-releases-and-rollbacks-cre-life-lessons" target="_blank">rollback first and investigate the problem later</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>We have seen this at Google any number of times, where a hastily deployed roll-forward fix either fails to fix the original problem, or indeed makes things worse. Even if it fixes the problem it may then uncover other latent bugs in the system; you’re taking yourself further from a known-good state, into the wilds of a release that hasn’t been subject to the regular strenuous QA testing. At Google, our philosophy is that “rollbacks are normal.” When an error is found or reasonably suspected in a new release, the releasing team rolls back first and investigates the problem second</em></p></blockquote>



<p> When things are on fire, the last thing you want to do is root-cause the bug and figure out which flag-flip will safely fix the problem. And that may not even fix things – there’s no guarantee that even if your teammate tried to put his changes behind a feature flag, he didn’t inadvertently introduce a bug that cannot be solved by a flag-flip.</p>



<p>Feature flags are a poor man’s alternative to binary rollbacks, and they definitely aren’t a substitute for having a great automated test suite and a robust QA process. If you’re relying on feature flags to remedy production bugs, you should stop and evaluate your team’s practices. Risk aversion is often a smell of your team <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time</a>.</p>



<h2>Death By Feature Flags</h2>



<p>You may be wondering at this point why we shouldn’t use feature flags anyway. After all, <em>“defense in depth” …</em> and it never hurts to have more fine-grain flexibility right?</p>



<p>While feature flags are great in some cases, we should also keep in mind their costs. Software engineering is primarily an exercise in managing complexity. And each feature flag immediately doubles the universe of corner cases that your programmers have to understand, and your code is required to handle. <em>“But what would happen if Foo is enabled, Bar is disabled, and we do independent A/B tests on Baz and Kaz on the same day?”</em> In my experience, this combinatorial explosion in complexity can and <strong>will</strong> lead to bugs. Not to mention slowing down the speed at which your team can make any changes.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24549917" target="_blank">To quote an amusing anecdote shared online</a>: <em>“A flag that hasn’t been set to off in a year can be masking a major regression. At my last job we had two major outages in as many years from defunct flags defaulting to ‘off’ when the feature flag system failed to return flag states.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But these feature flags are only temporary. You should be removing them as soon as possible!”</em></p>



<p>Sure, and we should also not allow our tech debt to accumulate and we should follow every single best-practice religiously. Unfortunately, this never happens in any corporate environment. Even in great teams, tech debt often gets de-prioritized in the face of new requests. Newcomers to the team or those on their way out, aren’t always disciplined enough to clean up their flags after a successful rollout. And sometimes, these tasks simply slip through the cracks and get forgotten.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24549917" target="_blank">Someone on HackerNews has pointed out</a> that as of Sept-2020, the release version of Windows <em>“has roughly 2500 feature flags. Some are permanently jammed into the on position, some off position, and the rest are configurable by its experimentation frameworks and hackers”</em>.</p>



<p>There is no better illustration of this than the KCG debacle where a financial firm lost half a billion dollars and almost went bankrupt in 30 minutes, partly due to dead code that was behind a feature flag.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-460m-loss"><em>The cause of the failure</em></a><em> was due to multiple factors. However, one of the most important was that a flag which had previously been used to enable Power Peg… Power Peg had been obsolete since 2003, yet still remained in the codebase some eight years later.</em></p><p><em>In 2005, an alteration was made to the Power Peg code which inadvertently disabled safety-checks which would have prevented such a scenario. However, this update was deployed to a production system at the time, despite no effort having been made to verify that the Power Peg functionality still worked</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Feature flags are a powerful tool that can help you experiment with new features, manage the rollout of complex epics, and mitigate the problems associated with not controlling your team’s deployments. </p>



<p>But they come at a significant cost, in the form of code complexity, tech debt, slower development speeds, and inevitably, bugs. </p>



<p>As tempting as it may be, there is no silver bullet here. Weigh the pros against the cons, and use this tool judiciously when it makes sense to do so.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>
  <p>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.
My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren’t, so there’s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.
Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</p>
<p>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter.
What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</p>
<p>To start, an observation.
A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (<a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> being one example I can’t live without).
And these languages are objectively bad.
This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.
While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it’s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn’t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different <code>null</code>s).</p>
<p>This is a general rule — as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.
Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn’t seem super relevant.
It’s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</p>
<p>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.
If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.
If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.
Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</p>
<p>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.
The quality of the language itself is secondary.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let’s see some examples which can be “explained” by this theory.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>
<p>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.
First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.
It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.
Second, C is the language of Unix.
(And yes, I would put C into the “easily improved upon” category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</p>
</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.
A common explanation for Java’s popularity is “marketing by Sun”, and subsequent introduction of Java into University’s curricula.
This doesn’t seem convincing to me.
Let’s look at the 90’s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://matklad.github.io/assets/lang-pop.png" alt="lang pop">
</p>

</div>
<p>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.
That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).
This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go</dt>
<dd>
<p>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.
In a sense, Go is an upgrade over “memory safe &amp; reasonably fast” Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.
One is scripting languages.
A highly dynamic runtime with <code>eval</code> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.
However, it’s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</p>
<p>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don’t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make some bold predictions using the theory.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)
This needs some explanation — on the first, blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.
But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, I predict Julia to become more popular.
It’s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy">Ousterhout’s Dichotomy</a> and insisting that, yeah, we’ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dart grows.
On the one hand, it’s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.
But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.
Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.
Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won’t grow much outside of it, <em>despite</em> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</p>

<p>In Formula 1 racing, you can win a world championship as a driver with one team but then not even make the top 10 without that team’s car and infrastructure. Venture can often feel like this, too. Many top performing VCs would struggle if they weren’t on their firm’s platform. And similarly, a far greater number of VCs might be able to do well if they were just at a firm with a strong enough brand. Most special are those that are the source of their own success.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/">Making Uncommon Knowledge Common</a>, I wrote about Rich Barton because he’s one of the rare founders (or investors) with the demonstrated ability to create multiple billion dollar companies. Unpacking and learning from the few who have shown repeatable and internally compounding approaches to building companies is important.</p>



<p>Unlike consumer, traditional enterprise markets lend themselves more naturally to deterministic and repeatable success. There’s a small handful of VCs who have clearly shown they can succeed repeatedly and whose approaches and playbooks are legible enough to imply it’s not a fluke. Speiser is one of them.</p>



<p>Speiser’s portfolio includes companies like Pure Storage and Snowflake Computing. It’s worth noting that Snowflake not only IPO’d and is now at a market cap of over $60B but Speiser and Sutter Hill Ventures owned more than 20% of the company leading up to the IPO. When Pure Storage went public, Sutter Hill held more than 25%. Speiser may have the highest percentage of portfolio companies that have become multi-billion dollar companies—and that trend looks to continue with his newer companies.</p>



<p>But impressive returns are not solely what matters for the industry. It’s tempting to evaluate firms by their returns, and from the LP perspective that may be the correct metric. But another, and more important way to judge VC firms is by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player">value they add above replacement</a> to their portfolio companies. How much do they help their portfolio companies increase their likelihood and magnitude of success? Firms do this most notably by providing capital, but also by other methods like lending their brand or directly helping with operations.</p>



<p>For founders, this value added is what matters. The returns of a VC firm only matter to a startup insofar as they translate into improved brand, network, or access to capital for the startup. A firm’s financial performance is a reasonable signal that they may add real value and be worth partnering with, especially since some aspects like brand strength for recruiting, future financing, and customer development are a function of perceived firm success. But to prospective portfolio companies, a fund’s returns are important only as a means, not an end.</p>



<p>What makes Speiser intriguing is how distinct his approach is from other VCs. The tantalizing clues suggest that he has figured something out that nobody else has: the formula for creating successful companies from scratch.</p>

<h2>The Speiser playbook</h2>



<p>At the core of Speiser’s approach is incubating companies, or “originating companies” in <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/11/10/sam-pullara-entrepreneur-vc-firm/">Sutter Hill nomenclature</a>. Instead of investing in existing companies, Speiser stays solely focused on one thing: starting and building companies. Even among others who have been very successful at incubations, he is the most singularly focused on this.</p>

<p>Every year Speiser incubates around one company. The core of his model is to find 2-3 co-founders and be the founding investor. Often he takes on the interim CEO role himself for the first year or two. This has many advantages. The biggest is that it reshapes the ideal founding team profile. He can focus on getting the right top technical co-founders that will have strong views on what to build and the ability to build it—even if they are people who don’t generally view themselves as having a natural inclination to be founders. This is a significant talent arbitrage.</p>



<h3>A better package for founders</h3>



<p>There has been a dearth of coverage of Snowflake’s three cofounders, Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Zukowski in both the news and social media. Partially this is because they have not sought the spotlight. But partially, it is due to the veneration of a certain type of founder we have, those who seek the limelight of public presence and being in control of every aspect of the company.</p>



<p>Snowflake’s founders are cut from a different cloth. As Benoit Dageville put it “We never thought of it as building a company. We just wanted to build a cloud product. The company was an afterthought.” Yet, their product and technical decisions have been prescient in threading the narrow path to taking on Amazon and Google in the most important core markets of cloud computing.</p>



<p>There are people who often don’t <em>want</em> to be CEO, or even to start a company. They are driven by their conviction of what the future should look like, as well as their frustration with the internal dynamics they confront at legacy incumbents that prevent them from creating that reality. But they are still unlikely to start a company due to all the inertial cruft that comes with founding a company—and especially with being CEO. They want to build what matters, not set up a new corporate structure, manage fundraising, or build a sales team.</p>



<p>Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/zoom-founder-left-job-because-he-wasnt-happy-became-billionaire.html">has explained</a> this feeling of being held back at Webex. He knew what should be built and that the Webex team could do it, but given the dynamics of Webex as a subsidiary of Cisco he was unable to get the political capital to do it. And he’s proven himself right by leaving with his Webex teammates and building Zoom. Considering he was VP Engineering at Webex and still unable to build what he thought was important should be a very discomfiting reality shock to large companies about the very real economic harm the malaise of their internal processes have caused. However, for every Eric Yuan, there are countless others that never leave and start a company. The inertial barriers are too high. They can stay at their company and struggle to work on what they know should be built. Or leave and take on more uncertainty and risk than they want.</p>



<p>Speiser introduces a third model that breaks through this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis">Scylla and Charybdis</a> dilemma. Start a company with Speiser and stay focused on what you want: deciding what to build, hiring the team you need, and building it. Speiser will handle fundraising, handling the operations generally, and setting up the sales motion and machine. Founders get much of the autonomy and upside of starting a new company while also getting support and guardrails so they can stay focused while having confidence the business is being built well.</p>



<p>Speiser doesn’t just take on these roles because founders don’t want to do it. There are actually aspects of company building where he should be better than the founders. Sutter Hill Ventures has the capital already, so it’s easy for them to take on responsibility for fundraising and remove that as a blocker. Instead of having to burn a lot of cycles fundraising, Sutter Hill can provide the capital. And they often do, leading multiple rounds into their companies. Or they can bring in outside investors, with the confidence that Sutter Hill can lead the entire round as a backstop if the process becomes too much of a hassle. Also, like any VC firm, Sutter Hill builds a brand that compounds their companies’ ability to raise follow on funding. At this point there are multiple firms that have made their bread and butter following on after Sutter Hill, to great success.</p>



<p>Similarly, Speiser is likely to have more experience in setting up companies and the initial customer development process than the founders will. Perhaps most importantly, he has relationships with customers and an established reputation that can be used to bootstrap the initial pilot conversations, which may be the point of highest leverage for these new startups.</p>



<p>These advantages all <em>compound</em> with every incremental company Speiser originates, and not just because of the typical brand network effects that venture has broadly. In many tangible ways, the spread between Speiser’s process knowledge relative to a new founder should widen with every new company.</p>



<p>As an industry we seem to often want to see machismo and martyrdom in founders. A decade ago it was wanting founders to be willing to mortgage their house and their kids’ college fund. Now it is founders wanting to be in charge of every aspect of companies. If founders aren’t willing to put everything on the line for the company their companies will be worse is the thought. As an ecosystem it doesn’t appear the data bears this out. Everything we do that has expanded opportunity and decreased the friction to more people becoming founders has led to huge benefits for the industry.</p>



<p>Just as Eric Yuan should be a massive shot across the bow for all large tech incumbents, Snowflake’s founders should be a wakeup call to venture that we have much further to go to enable and support even more brilliant people who don’t think of themselves as CEOs to bring their vision of the world into existence.</p>



<h3>A better package for CEOs</h3>



<p>But this isn’t the only talent arbitrage Speiser’s playbook benefits from. The interim CEO model allows another one too. As the startup does well and figures out its product market fit, Speiser eventually rolls off as CEO and finds a full-time replacement to take on the role as he takes a step back into being solely a board member.</p>



<p>His companies are <em>very</em> advantaged in finding great CEOs to take the mantle. To understand why, look at it from the perspective of an executive looking to become the CEO of a company. Like the potential founders, these executives have their own Scylla and Charybdis dilemma. They want to be CEO of a company, but they also want to join a company that has already …</p></div></div>

<p>Networking can seem like <em>voodoo</em>; many of us take for granted how data transmits from one computer to the next. Recently, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a>, has attracted a lot of publicity for it’s inclusion into the Linux kernel &amp; for it’s stated goal of making setting up VPNs simpler.</p>

<p>Behind all the magic, is a very simple premise. Let’s shed some of the complexity and break it down to <em>first principles</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<blockquote>
  <p>A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/VPN_overview-en.svg" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>The definition seems <em>simple</em> enough. Bridge two discrete private networks &amp; make them look like they are <strong>one</strong>.</p>

<p>We will accomplish this task with a <em>tunnel</em>.</p>

<h3 id="network-reachability">Network Reachability</h3>

<p>Let’s consider a very simple example with two distinct private networks: <em>home</em> &amp; <em>office</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Home Network</strong>: Is the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet and has a laptop with the <em>private IP address</em> of 192.168.1.192.</p>

<p><strong>Office Network</strong>: Is the 172.31.0.1/20 subnet and has a server with <em>private IP address</em> of 172.31.9.116 &amp; a <em>public IP address</em> of 54.219.126.112.</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_simple_drawing.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I did not include the routers or gateways in the figure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty common to what most people might experience with their home setup.</p>

<p><em>private</em> IP addresses are those that can only be reached from other machines within the subnet.</p>

<p><em>public</em> IP addresses are those that are broadcasted to neighboring routers and exchanged via the BGP protocol.</p>

<p>The goal of the tunnel will be to join these two <em>distinct</em> subnets into a <em>virtual</em> one; a <em>virtual private network</em> (VPN).</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_simple_drawing_merge.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>Let’s choose a VPN CIDR range of 172.31.255.0/24. I don’t need a subnet so large, so let’s set a mask of /24 which gives us ~254 hosts.</p>

<p>We will then assign two IP addresses within that subnet to the two hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Server</strong>: 172.31.255.13</p>

<p><strong>Laptop</strong>: 172.31.255.7</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The private network address range is 172.16.0.0/12 according to <a href="https://www.arin.net/reference/research/statistics/address_filters/">https://www.arin.net/reference/research/statistics/address_filters/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tun-network-interface-device">TUN network interface device</h3>

<p>The first step in setting up our tunnel will be to create a <em>tun</em> network interface device<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. A <em>tun</em> device is a kernel virtual network device, they are not backed by a physical device.</p>

<p>Packets sent by the operating system via the <em>tun</em> device are delivered to a user space program which attaches itself to the device. A userspace program may also pass packets into a <em>tun</em> device. In this case the device delivers these packets to the operating-system network stack thus emulating as if it has arrived from an external source.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>tun</em> devices operate at the L3 layer (IP). There is an analogous <em>tap</em> device that operates at the L2 layer (Ethernet).</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span># on server &amp; laptop run the following</span>
<span># adding the user will allow userspace programs running as that user</span>
<span># to attach to it without needing `sudo`</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip tuntap add dev tun0 mode tun user <span>$USER</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip <span>link set </span>dev tun0 up

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We then need to assign the new <em>private IP addresses</em> for our new subnet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># on the laptop run the following</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip addr add 172.31.255.7/24 dev tun0
<span># on the server run the following</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip addr add 172.31.255.13/24 dev tun0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s create a general routing rule so that anything destined for that subnet routes to the desired <em>tun</em> device.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the following on both laptop &amp; server</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip route add 172.16.0.0/12 dev tun0

<span># Let's validate our route. Pick a machine and</span>
<span># test the route for the other one.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ip route get 172.31.255.8
172.31.255.8 dev tun0 src 172.31.255.7 uid 780412
    cache
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>We make sure to test the route with an IP address not present on either machine, otherwise it will match to the <em>lo</em> (loopback) device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! We have setup some network interfaces and routing rules, but what is actually transmitting the packets to give the <em>illusion</em> of a single network?</p>

<p>Our <strong>tunneling</strong> software.</p>

<h3 id="lametun">lametun</h3>

<p>The <em>heart</em> to setting up VPN is the software bridging the packets across the two networks. In our case, we will be using a userspace program and the <em>tun</em> device; however <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a> has included this capability within the kernel itself.</p>

<p>Since this will be a <em>toy</em> example, I’ve named the program <strong>lametun</strong>. It will be a single <em>golang</em> file with minimal dependencies to demonstrate how simple it is.</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/vpn_lametun_simple.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p><strong>lametun</strong> will read all incoming packets at a particular UDP port (i.e. <em>1234</em>) and write it to the <em>tun</em> device.</p>

<p><strong>lametun</strong> will read all outgoing packets from the <em>tun</em> device and write it back out the physical network device.</p>

<p>Both the <em>server</em> &amp; <em>laptop</em> will run <strong>lametun</strong> on UDP port <em>1234</em>, listening on the physical network device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure your firewall allows whatever port we are using for <strong>lametun</strong>.
I was using an EC2 host and had to also allow the UDP port through the SecurityGroup as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The TUN device however emits raw L3 packets (IP packets), and the IP address of the device is not-routable. Simply copying the packet to the physical device is not enough; it must be routable.</p>

<p>We will <em>encapsulate</em> the packet with a routable IP &amp; UDP header destined for the VPN peer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UDP is chosen since there is a lot of literature how TCP over TCP is a bad idea; TCP Meltdown.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>

<p>Encapsulation as a concept is straightforward. It is the act of embedding a protocol within the data/payload of another. Here we see an example of embedding TCP-IP within the payload of a UDP packet.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/foo-encap.png" alt="VPN graphic"></p>

<p>Using encapsulation, we can now have non-routable packets traverse the Internet. Once they arrive at the <strong>lametun</strong> destination, the inner packet is forwarded onto the <em>tun</em> device to continue routing.</p>

<h3 id="mtu">MTU</h3>

<p>Typically, in order to guarantee delivery across the Internet, network devices restrict the <em>maximum transmission unit</em> (MTU), which is the size of the Ethernet frame, to <em>1500</em> bytes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although IP protocol supports fragmentation, there is no guarantee that every link along the way does. It’s best to stay within the 1500 byte limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that we are embedding our transmission protocol within a IP-UDP datagram, we must account for this reserved headroom accordingly or risk breaking the 1500 byte boundary.</p>

<p>Given that the IP header is 20 bytes (minimum) and the UDP header is 8 bytes, our new MTU is <em>1472</em> bytes.</p>

<p>A simple demonstration will help.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Upper limit MTU is 1500 safely across the Internet</span>
<span># IPv4 header is 20 bytes (minimum)</span>
<span># UDP header is 8 bytes</span>
<span># ICMP header is 8 bytes</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1500 - 20 (IP) - 8 (UDP) =  1472 new maximum MTU</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1472 - 20 (IP) - 8 (ICMP) = 1444 maximum payload for ICMP payload</span>
<span># (We actually remove another 4 bytes due to metadata the TUN device includes)</span>
<span># = 1440 maximum payload</span>

<span># We will run the following on the laptop</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ping <span>-M</span> <span>do</span> <span>-s</span> 1440 172.31.255.13

<span># Use wireshark to check the packet</span>
<span>&gt;</span> tshark udp port 1234
1 0.000000000 76.242.91.200 → 172.31.9.116 UDP 1514 1234 → 1234 <span>Len</span><span>=</span>1472

<span># If we bump the ICMP payload by a single byte, it will fragment</span>
<span>&gt;</span> ping <span>-M</span> <span>do</span> <span>-s</span> 1441 172.31.255.13

<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>tshark udp port 1234
1 0.000000000 76.242.91.200 → 172.31.9.116 IPv4 1514 Fragmented IP protocol <span>(</span><span>proto</span><span>=</span>UDP 17, <span>off</span><span>=</span>0, <span>ID</span><span>=</span>3136<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we simply need to adjust the MTU on our TUN device accordingly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the following on both laptop and server</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>sudo </span>ip <span>link set </span>dev tun0 mtu 1472
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Sweet! Enough theory, show me the code!</p>

<p>I’ve kept the code to a single-file for demonstration purposes but you can also find it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/lametun">https://github.com/fzakaria/lametun</a>. It is heavily commented for learning purposes.</p>

              <p>In this article, we’re going to implement authentication and authorization for a gateway API application that routes to two different microservices. FusionAuth will be the auth server for the gateway.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>An API gateway with microservices is a common pattern for enterprise architectures. In this post, we’ll pretend we’re setting this up for an eCommerce enterprise. Our gateway application is a central API that will control access to a product catalog service and a product inventory service. We’ll allow customers to access public endpoints but require authentication for some of the product inventory endpoints.</p>

<p>For this article, we’re going to need a running FusionAuth instance and three simple Node/Express applications. You can download the <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node-services-gateway">example project</a> for this article and customize your FusionAuth configuration accordingly, or you can follow along conceptually.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, it will be very helpful to go through the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">5-Minute Setup Guide</a> first, as that will set up the needed users and roles in FusionAuth.</p>

<p>We’re going to have four applications running, on the following ports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FusionAuth: <code>9011</code></li>
  <li>Gateway Application: <code>3000</code></li>
  <li>Product Catalog Service: <code>3001</code></li>
  <li>Product Inventory Service: <code>3002</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re also going to be dealing with authentication and authorization quite a bit, so let’s briefly clarify what we mean by these terms.</p>

<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and authorization</h2>
<p>Authentication is the verification of a particular user. When a user is logged in, they’re saying to the application, “Hey, it’s the real John Doe, let me in.” The application validates their credentials, and they have access.</p>

<p>In our API gateway, we’re going to use FusionAuth, based on the 5-Minute Setup Guide as mentioned above. We’ll talk about specific details when we set up our API gateway application later.</p>

<p>Authorization is the process whereby we verify that a particular user (e.g. John Doe) has access to certain parts of our system (e.g. product inventory). In our eCommerce ecosystem, we’re going to require authorization for the product inventory API, but not for the basic product APIs, since we want everyone to access the latter. For the product inventory route, we’ll allow users with the “admin” role access.</p>

<h2 id="product-catalog-service">Product Catalog service</h2>

<p>We’ll return to authentication and authorization soon, but let’s start building our applications! We’re going to start with the services and work our way towards the gateway application.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-nodejs-product-catalog">Setting up the nodejs Product Catalog</h3>

<p>Before you get going, you’ll need node installed (code tested with version 14). If you don’t have it installed, grab it from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">the node website</a>.</p>

<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node-services-gateway">project</a> onto your local computer and <code>cd</code> into the directory.</p>

<p>You’ll notice three folders corresponding to our applications: <code>gateway</code>, <code>product-catalog</code>, and <code>product-inventory</code>. Go ahead and <code>cd</code> into the <code>product-catalog</code> application and do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install the dependencies.</li>
  <li>Start the application by running <code>npm start</code>. It should be running on port <code>3001</code>, which is defined in <code>bin/www</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that your application is up and running, you should be able to send a request to it and get a response. Run this <code>curl</code> command in a separate terminal window and you should get a successful response with an empty list of products (<code>products: []</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl http://localhost:3001/products
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s open up the hood on this and check out the <code>routes/index.js</code> file that gave us our <code>/products</code> route.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>

<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/products</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>products: []</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/products/:id</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>`product: </span><span>${</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>router</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve created two basic routes, <code>/products</code> and <code>/products/:id</code>, so we can get a list of products and a single product. Obviously, for a real microservice, these routes would request the product information from a datastore. For now, the former is returning an empty array <code>[]</code> and the latter returns the product id requested.</p>

<p>Try modifying your curl request to add a product ID, and notice that the response will indicate the specific ID you requested.</p>

<p>The Product Catalog service is ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="product-inventory-service">Product Inventory service</h2>

<p>Open up another terminal window and enter the <code>product-inventory</code> folder. Run <code>npm install</code> to install needed dependencies.</p>

<p>Here’s what our Product Inventory service looks like (in <code>routes/index.js</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>

<p>In this service, we’ve just got one route, to get products for a specific store or branch. Notice, however, that we’re allowing access (or denying it) based on the inclusion of an <code>admin</code> role in the <code>roles</code> header. The API gateway application will be responsible for passing this data to our Product Inventory service.</p>

<p>If you were to start the service (go ahead and do so with <code>npm start</code>) and send a request to <code>http://localhost:3002/branches/1/products</code>, you should receive a 403. You can simulate a successful response by adding a <code>roles</code> header with a value of <code>admin</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-i</span> <span>-H</span> <span>"Accept: application/json"</span> <span>-H</span> <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> <span>-H</span> <span>"roles: admin"</span> http://localhost:3002/branches/1/products
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve got our Product Inventory service up and running, with authorization to ensure that only admins can access a list of products for a branch. Doing an authorization check at the service level allows us to granularly implement authorization.</p>

<h3 id="api-level-authentication-for-your-microservices">API-level authentication for your microservices</h3>

<p>A quick note on API-level authentication. We’re implementing centralized authentication through the API gateway. Only that gateway should have access to these microservices. You could do this at the network level, or with some form of API-level authentication, like an <a href="https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/quality/qualityManagementAndGovernance/APIKey">API Key</a>. It’s a little much for us to cover in this article, but it’s definitely something you’ll want to implement before launching your microservices into production.</p>

<h2 id="the-gateway-application">The gateway application</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve got our Product Catalog and Product Inventory services running on ports <code>3001</code> and <code>3002</code>, we’re ready to tackle the API gateway application.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the code, let’s briefly discuss why we’re creating our own gateway as opposed to using something like <a href="https://apigee.com/about/cp/api-gateway">Apigee</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon’s API Gateway</a>. We certainly could go that route, but in creating our own gateway, we have ultimate flexibility. There’s an additional benefit of gaining an understanding of exactly what a gateway application is doing.</p>

<p>Our gateway application is straightforward and lightweight. It primarily functions as a router, directing requests to the appropriate service. But, because it’s a gateway to our distributed services, it’s the perfect spot for centralized user-level auth checks.</p>

<h3 id="centralized-authentication">Centralized authentication</h3>

<p>Centralizing authentication is a common pattern because authentication is primarily just a check to ensure the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user is logged in</li>
  <li>The user is who they say they are</li>
</ul>

<p>In the context of separate services in an eCommerce domain, we want to have this centralized authentication so one check in the gateway gives a user access to the services, assuming their credentials check out. We’ll use FusionAuth for authenticating each of our routes before we forward them over to the right service.</p>

<h3 id="fusionauth-setup">FusionAuth Setup</h3>

<p>Open up yet another terminal window, enter the <code>gateway</code> director, and run <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">5-Minute Setup Guide</a> for FusionAuth. During setup, the application that you configure will be linked to our gateway application, so you can name it “Gateway”. Note that while FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configurations, here you’re setting everything up in the default tenant.</p>

<p>Update the <code>routes/index.js</code> in the <code>gateway</code> directory with your FusionAuth application’s client ID and secret and <code>views/index.pug</code> with your client ID. Then start the application by running <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<p>This application will be our gateway (hence the name) to our services, so at this point, we should access our services only through the gateway application. Run the <code>curl</code> command for <code>/products</code>, but do so on port <code>3000</code>, which will hit our gateway application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl http://localhost:3000/products
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we’re funneling traffic through our gateway application and forwarding it over to the Product Catalog service. You can verify this by opening the terminal window for the running Product Catalog service and checking the logs. You should see the request we just sent hitting that server:</p>



<h3 id="routes">Routes</h3>

<p>Let’s go through the gateway application’s <code>routes/index.js</code> file step by step. We start by requiring necessary files and setting up a <code>FusionAuthClient</code>. We also include a handy authentication middleware, which we’ll use on our routes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// ...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>request</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>request</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span><span>FusionAuthClient</span><span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>@fusionauth/typescript-client</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>clientSecret</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET</span><span>];</span>

<span>// ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our gateway application, along with our services, are based on the <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node">fusionauth-example-node</a> project, which gives us a basic UI (at the root) for interacting with FusionAuth. We also have a route for our OAuth redirect:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt">Dolt</a> is a relational database with Git-like version control features. In particular the underlying data storage format is a commit graph, and each commit represents the complete state (schema and data) of the database at a point in time. <a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/doltpy">Doltpy</a>, our Python API, provides users with tools to easily move data between their existing databases and Dolt. This post covers adding support for Oracle. We wanted to support Oracle because several customers asked for it. Given how widely adopted it is as a database solution, this is not surprising. Supporting Oracle proved more complicated than the other databases. Most of that complexity comes from Oracle having a model that differs substantially from Postgres and MySQL, as well as how long the database takes to actually startup. We cover how to abstract away this complexity in a clean test fixture in the final section using Docker.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Let's start with the goal: we want to provide a simple API for moving data from Dolt to Oracle, or from Oracle to Dolt. Let's say we want to get data from the <code>revenue_estimates</code> table in Oracle into Dolt for versioning, we want to write code like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>etl<span>.</span>sql_sync <span>import</span> sync_from_dolt<span>,</span> get_dolt_target_writer<span>,</span> get_oracle_source_reader

sync_to_dolt<span>(</span>get_oracle_source_reader<span>(</span>oracle_engine<span>)</span><span>,</span>
             get_dolt_target_writer<span>(</span>dolt_repo<span>)</span><span>,</span>
             <span>{</span><span>'revenue_estimates'</span><span>:</span> <span>'revenue_estimates'</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We need some objects for managing database connections, which are defined as follows:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> doltpy<span>.</span>core <span>import</span> Dolt
<span>import</span> sqlalchemy <span>as</span> sa
<span>import</span> cx_Oracle


dolt <span>=</span> Dolt<span>.</span>init<span>(</span><span>'my-org/estiamtes'</span><span>)</span>
dolt<span>.</span>sql_server<span>(</span><span>)</span>

engine <span>=</span> create_engine<span>(</span><span>'oracle+cx_oracle://'</span><span>,</span> creator<span>=</span>_oracle_connection_helper<span>)</span>
<span>def</span> _oracle_connection_helper<span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> cx_Oracle<span>.</span>connect<span>(</span><span>'oracle_user'</span><span>,</span> <span>'oracle_pwd'</span><span>,</span> <span>'{}:{}/{}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>'oracle_host'</span><span>,</span> <span>1521</span><span>,</span> <span>'oracle_db'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order to incorporate Oracle into our SQL Sync tooling we need to verify that we can "round trip" data from Dolt to Oracle, and from Oracle to Dolt. We do the same for Postgres and MySQL. In practice this means we need instances of each of these databases running, and available to our test harness. The most repeatable and portable way we have found is to use <code>pytest-docker</code> to run a containerized instance of each database implementation. The architecture looks something like this:
<span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/379407ef35fdd1dadd387ba867a0ae9c/ef9e5/sql_sync_test_architecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>To achieve this we need three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a Docker image available that stands up an Oracle instance</li>
<li>augment our test harness to run that image, and populate it with a test table</li>
<li>code to execute and test the sync</li>
</ol>
<p>We will examine them in reverse order, starting with the implementation, as that's closest to the user value the feature delivers.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Once Oracle was incorporated into our test harness, actually reading and writing from it was straightforward, and done via SQL Alchemy. We focus on the issues caused by how SQL Alchemy maps between higher level types and Oracle types. One main benefit of SQL Alchemy is the <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/tutorial.html">SQL Expression Language</a> that abstracts over multiple database implementations, something we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-24-schema-support-in-sql-sync/">blogged</a> about. In most cases this takes care of translating between database implementation specific types by providing a higher level set of types. A concrete example is how this higher level expression language allows us to use a single definition of a test table, making our code cleaner and more readable, as well as reducing database implementation specific boilerplate:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> sqlalchemy<span>.</span>types <span>import</span> Integer<span>,</span> DateTime<span>,</span> String<span>,</span> Text<span>,</span> Float<span>,</span> Date

TEST_TABLE_METADATA <span>=</span> Table<span>(</span>TABLE_NAME<span>,</span>
                            MetaData<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'first_name'</span><span>,</span> String<span>(</span><span>256</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'last_name'</span><span>,</span> String<span>(</span><span>256</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'playing_style_desc'</span><span>,</span> Text<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'win_percentage'</span><span>,</span> Float<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'high_rank'</span><span>,</span> Integer<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'turned_pro'</span><span>,</span> DateTime<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                            Column<span>(</span><span>'date_of_birth'</span><span>,</span> Date<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the snippet above <code>engine</code> is a SQL Alchemy object that manages a database connection pool. Passing that engine to a call to create the table we just defined will execute the generated query against the corresponding database instance. This is exactly what we do to create a test table in our containerized Oracle instance:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>TEST_TABLE_METADATA.metadata.create_all(engine)</code></pre></div>
<p>The type mapping issue arises because SQL Alchemy translates both <code>sqlalchemy.types.Date</code> and <code>sqlalchemy.types.DateTime</code> to Oracle's <code>DATE</code> type. This is clearly a bug, as this amounts to "destructive" type coercion, and in fact the library should not permit writes of <code>datetime.datetime</code> Python objects to <code>DATE</code> without at least warning the user of information loss. We plan to implement fixes to SQL Alchemy, and push them back to that project as a wider benefit to the community.</p>
<p>For the purposes of using the data sync, however, this is not an issue. This code is purely for creating a test table, and we do not yet support schema sync in Oracle. We work around this in our test suite.</p>
<h3>Test Harness</h3>
<p>In order for us to execute the SQL Alchemy expressions above, we need to incorporate a running Docker image that exposes an Oracle instance to our test harness. We launch our containers via <code>pytest-docker</code>, a <code>pytest</code> plugin that wraps <code>docker-compose</code>. This allows us to define Docker services using dictionaries which are in turn translated into YAML:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span><span>(</span>scope<span>=</span><span>'session'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>docker_compose_file</span><span>(</span>tmpdir_factory<span>,</span> mysql_service_def<span>,</span> postgres_service_def<span>,</span> oracle_service_def<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    compose_file <span>=</span> tmpdir_factory<span>.</span>mktemp<span>(</span><span>'docker_files'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>'docker-compose.yml'</span><span>)</span>

    compose_conf <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'version'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'services'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>'mysql'</span><span>:</span> mysql_service_def<span>,</span>
            <span>'postgres'</span><span>:</span> postgres_service_def<span>,</span>
            <span>'oracle'</span><span>:</span> oracle_service_def
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>with</span> compose_file<span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'w'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> f<span>:</span>
        yaml<span>.</span>dump<span>(</span>compose_conf<span>,</span> stream<span>=</span>f<span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> compose_file<span>.</span>strpath</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this fixture itself depends on a test fixture called <code>oracle_service_def</code> which specifies how to launch the Oracle service definition. Again, this fixture returns a dictionary, which is incorporated into <code>docker_compose_file</code> as follows:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span><span>(</span>scope<span>=</span><span>'session'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>oracle_service_def</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'image'</span><span>:</span> <span>'oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'container_name'</span><span>:</span> ORACLE_CONTAINER_NAME<span>,</span>
        <span>'ports'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'{port}:{port}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>port<span>=</span>ORACLE_LISTENER_PORT<span>)</span><span>,</span>
                  <span>'{port}:{port}'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>port<span>=</span>ORACLE_OEM_EXPRESS_PORT<span>)</span><span>]</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following section we detail how to get an Oracle image that takes a reasonable amount of time to start (around a minute). That is still too slow for <code>pytest</code> which will throw errors when our fixtures for fetching a SQL Alchemy engine object run. We can put some retry logic around those calls to make the fixture swallow errors for some reasonable period of time until it obtains a connection:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span>

<p>Our test harness is now augmented to fire up a service running an instance of Oracle XE. In order to get this container running we needed to create the actual image, as unlike Postgres and MySQL, there was not a freely available on one on Docker Hub.</p>
<h2>Building an Image</h2>
<p>Up until this point we have assumed the instance of an Oracle image. This proved a little tricky in practice. We found a GitHub repository containing some tools for building images <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance">here</a>. We cloned the repo, and ran the following from the appropriate subdirectory:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ /buildDockerImage.sh -v 18.4.0 -x</code></pre></div>
<p>After about twenty minutes, this produced an image that we could then use to run a container in our development in environment, in this case locally on OSX:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ docker run --name test_oracle \
-p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PWD=oracle_password \
oracle/database:18.4.0-xe</code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, it takes about 15 minutes for the Oracle database to get into a state were it is accepting connections. This is far too slow for a test suite, as it would make a single test run take more than fifteen minutes. Slow tests discourage developers from using them, increasing the the likelihood of error. Fortunately, Docker provides functionality for creating an image from a running container (credit to <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-09-20-oracle-support-in-sql-sync/(https://medium.com/@ggajos/drop-db-startup-time-from-45-to-3-minutes-in-dockerized-oracle-19-3-0-552068593deb)%20for%20inspiration">this blog post</a>. The following command creates a snapshot of the container we fired up in our dev environment in the previous step:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ docker commit --author "Oscar Batori me@my-email.com" --message "Fast Oracle XE snapshot" oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick</code></pre></div>
<p>The image could then be started as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>docker run --name test_oracle \
-p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PWD=oracle_password \
oscarbatori/oracle-database:18.4.0-xe-quick</code></pre></div>
<p>We now had an image that could present stand up a running Oracle instance in under a minute, allowing us to build the test harness and tests detailed above on top of it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post we covered how we incorporated Oracle into our <code>doltpy.etl.sql_sync</code>, a module of the Dolt's Python API, Doltpy, that provides utilities to users who would like to use Dolt alongside existing relational database solutions. We hope that by supporting Oracle we will vastly increase the number of users who are able to capture the benefits for a version controlled SQL database while not having to abandon their existing tools. We have a full SQL Sync guide in our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/guides/sql-sync/">documentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>TikTok’s algorithm must have the best PR in all of tech: a prevalent view is that it’s the singular magic behind TikTok’s success:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Total disagreement on my timeline right now as to whether the value of TikTok is 100 percent in its algorithm, or 100 percent in its user base. Where do you land? (I'm more and more convinced that it's the user base) [POLL]</p>— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1305216706546225152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>With the news that the TikTok/Oracle <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3101362/tiktoks-algorithm-not-sale-bytedance-tells-us-source">won’t include the algorithm</a> and the possibility that Oracle will have to replace it, some have concluded that TikTok’s popularity will flatline, that it’s only a matter of time before Facebook eats their lunch via Instagram Reels. But despite Facebook’s previous success at cloning the competition, TikTok is a much more formidable challenge: they’ve built strong network effects on top of a unique graph that Facebook doesn’t have –&nbsp;one built on niche interests and esoterica rather than people you know or recognize. Historically, social products have been extremely durable to competition because of network effects, even more so when the graph is unique – Facebook being a prime example. Take the algorithm out of TikTok and it’ll certainly be hampered, but pure algorithmic advantages aren’t that strong of a moat: best practices dissipate through industry quickly, and most of what makes ML good in the first place is the underlying training data generated by user activity.</p>

<p>If network effects are what keeps TikTok on top today, is the algorithm responsible for getting TikTok here in the first place? The answer is a lot more complex than that.</p>

<h2 id="tiktoks-virtuous-cycle">TikTok’s Virtuous Cycle</h2>

<p>To understand TikTok’s strategy, Michael Porter’s framework is a useful guide. In his seminal <a href="https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy">“What Is Strategy?” paper</a> (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/hitnrun10/what-is-strategy-30278968">non-paywall slide summary</a>), he laid out a framework for what defines a successful strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strategy relies on unique activities</strong>: the essence of strategy is choosing to <em>do</em> different things and not just rely on general operational effectiveness, which is easily copyable.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic strength comes from the fit between unique activities:</strong> the unique activities need to be compatible, and ideally compound, such that the total value of all of them is larger than the sum of its parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Activities must require tradeoffs</strong>: some activities are incompatible with each other, while others are a large opportunity cost. If neither is true about the activities a company chooses, a competitor can engage in those same activities with little downside.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a strategy is successful, it often forms a virtuous cycle: the activities compound in a powerful feedback loop that causes the product to improve at a faster and faster rate. What is TikTok’s virtuous cycle? Understanding their core activities is a crucial first step:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Videos are short, making them easy to consume and to make</li>
  <li>Consumers mostly watch videos made by creators they don’t know in real life (family/friends) or recognize (influencers/brands)</li>
  <li>Videos are primarily distributed by an algorithm instead of by a follow graph</li>
  <li>TikTok’s UX (auto-playing videos watched one at a time) generates rich signal for every video watched, helping the algorithm learn a person’s preferences quickly (to be expanded on in a future post)</li>
  <li>Music is remixable and the main way trends get started and grow</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities aren’t all unique to TikTok –&nbsp;videos on Instagram are short, YouTube distributes videos algorithmically –&nbsp;but how they fit together and <em>compound</em> is unique to TikTok:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ML algorithms like TikTok’s suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(recommender_systems)">the cold start problem</a>: it’s difficult to make good predictions about what you will like before you use it. The videos on TikTok are short, so it’s easy for consumers to watch many of them at once, and their UX provides rich signal about every video.</li>
  <li>If the videos are short, you need a lot of it to fill the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90395898/is-tiktok-a-time-bomb">45 minutes per day the average person spends on TikTok</a>. Making consumers follow enough creators to fill up a feed would be extremely cumbersome, so instead TikTok pulls in creators from everywhere in the main “For You” page. This is only possible because the algorithm can quickly learn about consumer’s preferences via the rich signal from short videos.</li>
  <li>How do creators know what kinds of videos to make, and how will the find an audience? Remixable music provides a signal of demand about what consumers want to watch and provides context and an audience for a creator to riff off of, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Mi-Pan-Su-Sus-6833400908727061253">no matter how weird</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compounding strength of this strategy is made crystal clear when you consider how frictionless it is for both creators and consumers to have a great experience on TikTok, and how it gets better for both groups as TikTok gets bigger:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creators</strong>: make videos using music as context, audience, and signal without having to develop an audience first or risk alienation of people you know in real life; as more and more consumers use TikTok, the niches only get deeper and weirder, and the algorithm gets better and better at routing your videos to the right consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumers</strong>: get a great feed experience without having to do any work to find and follow accounts; your feed gets better and better as TikTok gets more data about what you like and creators make more videos for every conceivable niche.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://jmohsenin.com/assets/images/tiktok-cycle.png" alt="TikTok's Virtuous Cycle"></p>

<p>This is a strong strategy, but critically, <em>this needs a certain amount of scale to work.</em> When TikTok was much smaller, many of these effects were much weaker. Fewer creators leads to fewer videos to choose from, making TikTok less engaging to consumers. Fewer consumers leads to a smaller potential audience, making it less enticing for creators. How do you solve for this and get to scale quickly, in a landscape as saturated as consumer internet? Paid acquisition. TikTok spent $1b on it throughout 2018 alone, becoming <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue-downloads-2019">the second-most downloaded app in 2019</a>, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion">topping 2 billion downloads by April 2020</a>, and recently announcing they have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html">100 million MAUs in the US alone, 50% of those DAUs</a>. This is an enormous amount of money to spend on user acquisition and only makes sense if your ARPU exceeds your CAC (unclear for TikTok) and/or you have strong network effects. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bytedance-60-billion-tiktok-global-us-valuation-2020-9-1029606381">With a rumored valuation in the $60 billion range</a>, it seems that bet paid off.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-facebook">What This Means for Facebook</h2>

<p>Instagram Reels isn’t going to supplant TikTok by simply cloning a few of its key aspects. TikTok’s activities require tradeoffs that Instagram might not be ready to make. Pushing Instagram creators to make Reels comes at the cost of other content they could make. Pushing Reels in the Home and Explore feeds siphons off consumer attention that would otherwise go to the rest of Instagram. The resulting signals are much messier given the different and competing goals within Instagram, making it harder to train a great algorithm.</p>

<p>Even if Facebook is ready to eat that cost, the experience is still going to be worse than on TikTok: Instagram’s graph doesn’t overlap heavily with TikTok’s, so Instagram’s ability to leverage their graph to jumpstart Reels is limited. TikTok is successful in part because the content is different than Instagram, where you could make and watch weird, funny, unpolished videos you wouldn’t find elsewhere. This is the critical difference that makes the Snapchat/Instagram stories saga non-comparative: Snapchat and Instagram’s graph had very high overlap, such that people could start using Instagram stories with little loss. This is not true of TikTok/Instagram and makes me skeptical that Reels is going to easily displace TikTok. Network effects are just that powerful.</p>

<p>I’ve been escaping the COVID and election news cycles the same way many people have, by watching copious amounts of streaming television. I typically like to watch lighter fare, shows that remind me of better times, such as the dystopian alternate history show <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, where there is no hint of a pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4f4wqytvQRc/X2kZRxC3gZI/AAAAAAAFGfU/jFsndmwbl_oqqvZqfX3c8jURlOxql79WACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="675" data-original-width="1200" height="360" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4f4wqytvQRc/X2kZRxC3gZI/AAAAAAAFGfU/jFsndmwbl_oqqvZqfX3c8jURlOxql79WACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/image.png" width="640"></a></p><p>As I finished my second episode yesterday, it was twenty minutes after midnight. My remote control had evidently fallen in the cracks between the cushions of my couch, and before I could locate it the next episode auto-played. I was immediately sucked into the intriguing narrative and I ended up watching two more episodes. I went to bed around 2:30AM.</p>

<p>Netflix added the behavior to automatically play the next episode by default in 2016, when their revenue was already over seven billion dollars a year. Autoplay boosted their numbers by enticing customers into watching more hours of TV. While the viewer is technically free to turn off the screen at any time, the company’s carefully designed choice architecture strongly nudges people into watching just one more episode.</p>

<p>Netflix and other streaming companies don’t mind that customers will sometimes stay up too late watching their shows, and those same customers will sometimes end up bleary eyed the next morning, driving their Hyundais through twisting mountain roads, weaving slightly as they navigate the tight turns in dense but fast-moving traffic.</p>

<p>These corporations prioritize growth over the well-being of their customers because their primary obligation is increasing shareholder value. Despite the fact that many of the people running those companies presumably have families and children, and despite that fact that many of them are surely compassionate people, the company is structurally designed to produce growth at all costs, so that is what the company does.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ghKxJj3XB7E/X2kaqHT3TpI/AAAAAAAFGfg/qFEYcL0qGjUtlN74WtsZ-qcOU74Aw8exACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="383" data-original-width="614" height="400" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ghKxJj3XB7E/X2kaqHT3TpI/AAAAAAAFGfg/qFEYcL0qGjUtlN74WtsZ-qcOU74Aw8exACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h400/image.png" width="640"></a></p><p>It might surprise you to learn that the United States is not run by soulless profit seeking corporations. We still live in a democracy, but the problem is not everyone participates fully in the democratic process. Those who don’t participate are essentially turning on presidential autoplay; their next leader will be thrust upon them instead of chosen.</p>

<p>Based on Trump’s improbable incumbency, if enough citizens leave autoplay on, Trump will be our president for another four years. Imagine you are at a restaurant, and you’ve just had a four-year-long meal featuring an unending stream of chaos and hostility. The art on the walls has been torn, there’s smoke billowing out of the kitchen, a number of patrons and staff lie dead on the floor.</p>

<p>Wheeling through this scene of destruction comes the waiter with a dessert cart. Before you can say anything, he picks up one of the desserts and stuffs it into your mouth. If enough people do not vote in November, that is what’s going to happen, the nightmare meal will continue for four more years, maybe longer.</p>

<p>We’ve been stumbling through a brutal year of crises with no end in sight. Leading us is a man-child whose motives are completely unaligned with our current and future needs, and whose temperament would make it difficult for him to successfully manage a Taco Bell. We need to turn autoplay off, we need to vote.</p>

<p>It’s past midnight in America. If we do nothing, we will be watching Trump all night long. We don’t have time for this, we have to go to work in the morning, we have to get up early and start picking through the rubble. This November we need to flip over the dessert cart and storm right out of the restaurant. The country is not a corporation, the country is a democracy, and we need to vote to keep it that way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6be4fe9c454ee7097fd4"><div><p>I’ve been responsible for the UX and overall Product Design of several web applications that all faced the same issue: In order to improve our machine learning model, we need our users to label information and correct the ML’s output. How do we entice our users to label information in order to train our machine learning models within the user flow without making it feel like work? How do we balance the ML’s initially minimal output with getting users to manually label data?&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve seen this design problem with use cases varying from property management analytics dashboard, to a chatbot analytics dashboard, and most recently with a resume formatting tool for recruiters. This blog post will be a case study of the full design process for a resume formatting tool with a focus on the ML labeling design later in the process.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>This client came to me with an existing web application targeted towards agency recruiters and their support teams. The problem being solved by this web app is that recruiters need to reformat candidates’ resumes all into the same agency-branded template, and sometimes remove any of the candidate’s identifiable information. The status quo of how this is currently done is manually, with a lot of copy-paste from the candidate’s original resume over to the agency’s branded resume template and front-sheet template. Turns out that’s why recruiters who message you on LinkedIn also ask you to type up your resume in a docx format (am I the only one who thought that was weird and annoying?)</p><p>As part of the questions that I asked the client, I discovered that their fully functional existing web application only had users who were friends and family, none of which were active users. Forms of marketing had not been fruitful. As such, I identified the core problems as a lack of user retention, user engagement and therefore a low percentage of users training the ML models.</p><h2>Creative Process</h2><p>I communicated to the client that the approach I take will involve doing a redesign without any constraints to the development, but then will be followed with reeling back the designs to iterate on their existing designs with a focus on what dev work will have the highest impact. As a part of this process, I also emphasized that I won’t be looking at their existing designs until a later point, as I didn’t want it to limit or create a bias in my creative thinking.</p><p>As this was a specialized B2B use case that I fully didn’t understand, since I’ve never worked as a recruiter, I started with User Interviews as a means to gain a deep understanding of the problem the web app is trying to solve and to understand the motivations and goals of the target users.</p><h2>User Interviews</h2><p>The client, who was previously a recruiter and understood the market, naturally seemed confident that most recruiters think as he does and formats resumes like he does.&nbsp; I wanted to see the status quo of how users are solving the problem that the client was trying to automate. I’ve found that with User Discovery Interviews, there is diminishing returns in terms of new information gained after about the 5th interview from the same user segment. Below I’ve included the user interview questions that I asked on the Zoom calls.</p><h3>User Interview Questions and Why</h3><p>I’d like to understand your work-flow of a recruiter’s resume editing process. I will be asking you some questions and watching you perform some work on screen-share. For the questions I ask, I’m looking to understand your perspectives based on your personal experiences in the industry.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Can you show me a typical end to end work-flow of what you do with 1 job candidate, from receiving the email up until you submit it to a client? When you do this, can you please think out loud and narrate what you’re doing, I might interrupt with some questions. [<em>Why?</em> Trying to observe the tasks that may be overlooked or under-reported by the recruiter because they’re so used to it. Observing for key points of frustration or boredom communicated by human error or changes in their tone, rather than words. Digging deeper with questions about why they did certain things the way they did, and questions to lead to what’s important to them.]</p></li><li><p>What is the most frustrating part of this process? [<em>Why?</em> Trying to see if what they verbalize as the most frustrating part matches my observation from the previous steps, as it will reveal the deepest pain point]</p></li><li><p>Are there some parts of this process that you made up yourself, perhaps short cuts, or something to be more efficient? [<em>Why?</em> Usually, if there are any such “hacks”, it makes for a good product feature or selling point.]</p></li><li><p>What do you enjoy most about this process? [<em>Why?</em> This is generally what motivates them to do their job and reveals their motivation, further allowing design centered thinking.]</p></li><li><p>What is your biggest hurdle in achieving success in this process? [<em>Why?</em> This is a higher level question when compared to #2 and allows for further design centered thinking like #4. Success in this context is important to talk about since their status quo process is just a means to that end.]</p></li><li><p>What is your title, and responsibilities? [<em>Why?</em> To see if there are any correlations amongst such demographic data and insights found unique to each interview.]</p></li></ol><h3>Initial Sketches</h3><p>Based on watching these users show me their process and express their motivations I started sketching all of my ideas on how it could be better done within the confounds of a web application. It was particularly important to get these ideas out of my mind before moving on to the next step, where for the first time I look at the user’s current design and user flow. These designs were never sent to the client, they were for me to reference at a later point (hence the rough presentation).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_26906"><div><h2>UX Audit</h2><p>I have written extensively about my UX Audit process on this third party <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/guide-to-ux-analysis"><span>blog</span></a>, so I won’t get into too many details in this post.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the problem was identified as user retention and engagement, without which the ML will be completely useless, I focused on a new user’s experience uploading their first resume, making corrections and downloading the ML output in the form of a reformatted resume (the happy path).</p><p>I approached it as if I was doing a user test on myself and annotated all of the parts of the process, considering important UX heuristics.</p><p>Here is a small set of the issues I pointed out in the UX audit:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_32288"><div><h2>Redesign</h2><p>By going through the process as it was originally designed, I found myself constantly running into the question of “What do I do next?”. To fix this problem, part of the redesign required improving the user onboarding and navigation structure by fixing the visual hierarchy and limiting the choices the user has. A great analogy for this part is Turbotax. Step-by-step, drawing attention to things displayed when the user needs them. As a part of this, I proposed a very simple 3 step process: Upload &gt; Edit Labels &gt; Preview and download.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_36671"><div><h3>Machine Learning UX</h3><p>The important part of designing a way for the users to correct ML output, and label data from scratch, is designing for the edge cases and finding a happy medium. After speaking with the team’s deep learning AI specialist (the ML guy), I identified the following to design for:</p><p>-ML model labels nothing and the user needs to label everything</p><p>-ML model labels a few things and the user needs to label everything else</p><p>-ML model labels everything and the user needs to check them and make corrections</p><p>As a part of my newly proposed 3 step navigation structure, this would all be in the Edit Labels section. As a part of this section, a great analogy to communicate my thinking process was Duolingo’s interface. After a user creates their first label, gamification and positive reinforcement would be extremely important to encourage the user to create subsequent labels. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_41202"><div><p>As a part of it, a user should not be able to see a rough bare-bones template output (as was the case in the designs at the time) and instead, would need to label a certain amount before ‘unlocking’ a more satisfying, complete looking output. Of course, as time went on and the ML model got better, they would automatically see good outputs. But in order to get there, the designs must first incentivize users to make labels.</p><p>I identified that the mechanism of the ML labeling interface would need to communicate the following:</p><p>-what things were labelled by ML&nbsp;</p><p>-what to label (I.E. first name)</p><p>-how to label something</p><p>-how to correct a label (I.E. last name was labelled as first name)</p><p>-how to correct the highlighted text (I.E. Arvand Alviri is labelled as first name, but the user should be able to change the highlight to be only Arvand, instead of removing the label and re-highlighting it from scratch)</p><p>-how to remove a label</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_45764"><div><h3>Final Steps: User Analytics to Correct Machine Learning Models</h3><p>For the final steps, I gave the client a user analytics tracking plan, that would help them make future product decisions, as well as gather extra data for the ML model. Things that I suggested they track in their user analytics tool included:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600290170084_50169"><div><p>As an example, these two would help identify which labels are most commonly missed by the ML, and which are most commonly mislabeled by the ML.&nbsp;</p><p>Other user analytics events that focused on user retention and engagement over the overall product as well. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>Last touched <!-- -->September 20, 2020</p></header><p>So <a href="https://linktr.ee/Norod78">Doron Adler</a> and I recently released our toonification translation model at our Toonify Yourself website. It turned out to be pretty popular with tens of thousands people visiting in the 22 hours it was running for, submitting almost a quarter of a million images for toonification.</p><p>It got quite a bit of interest on social media, and picked up on a few websites. Unfortunately we had to turn off the toonification server before costs started to get out of hand, but we’re working on bringing it back so people can carry on playing with the model for free.</p><p>A lot of people have expressed interest in how the model work and how the website was run. So here’s a blog post with some details on the traffic and running costs, as well as the technical details of how to run a deep neural network in the cloud serving tens of thousands of requests an hour!</p><h2>Making an efficient Toonification model</h2><p><strong>If you want to know about the details of the original Toonification model, see <a href="https://www.justinpinkney.com/toonify-yourself">this blog post</a>.</strong></p><p>The original Toonification method involved an expensive optimisation process to encode a person’s face using the blended StyleGAN model which can take several minutes to run even on a GPU. Clearly this wasn’t going to cut it as a web app! A common pattern in deep learning is replacing expensive optimisations with more neural networks<sup id="fnref-style-transfer"><a href="#fn-style-transfer">style-transfer</a></sup>. We used the basic idea described in <em>StyleGAN2 Distillation for Feed-Forward Image Manipulation</em><sup id="fnref-distillation"><a href="#fn-distillation">distillation</a></sup>, i.e. training a pix2pixHD model to apply the transformation to any arbitrary image, rather than first having to perform the optimisation step.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>The novel part here is that the pairs of images we use for the training process are pairs produced by the original FFHQ model and the blended model<sup id="fnref-new-model"><a href="#fn-new-model">new-model</a></sup>. Although the pix2pixHD model is only trained on image generated by the two StyleGAN models, when it’s done we should be able to apply it to any image and get the same toonification result</p><figure>

  </figure><h2>Deploying the model</h2><p>So after the initial interest on Twitter about my experiments putting together a local web app for myself to run the Toonify model I decided to take a crack at putting up a website where anybody could run it on their own images.</p><p>First things first I wasn’t going to be running anything on a GPU, so I needed to get the pix2pixHD model runnable on a CPU. The original pix2pixHD repo has some bugs which prevent inference without a GPU and I fixed these <a href="https://www.justinpinkney.com/making-toonify/github.com/justinpinkney/pix2pixHD/">on my fork</a> if anyone is interested. In the end I actually decided to export the model to ONNX format so I could run it using the ONNX runtime. This makes the dependencies more lightweight than trying to run using PyTorch and (I hope) the ONNX runtime is built with performance in mind.</p><p>I went for Google Cloud Run as a means of deploying the web app. All the thing needs to do is accept an image, run inference, and return the result. It’s totally stateless so a good fit for the Cloud Run model. The use of Docker containers in Cloud Run meant that it was easy for me to bundle up any required dependencies, scalability was built right in and there is a generous free allowance (not generous enough it would turn out!).</p><p>So after a few evenings of putting together a small app using Flask and Bootstrap, things were ready to deploy!</p><h2>Toonification in the Wild</h2><p>So after some beta testing with friends I announced the release of the <a href="https://toonify.justinpinkney.com/">Toonify Yourself</a> website on Twitter. It quickly got some reasonable traffic and people seemed to be enjoying trying the model out on themselves.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Some were complaining that their faces were never detected no matter what they submitted, and I fairly quickly figured out (and many helpful people online started to point out) that it was an issue with image rotation on iPhones<sup id="fnref-transpose"><a href="#fn-transpose">transpose</a></sup>.</p><p>By the next morning traffic started to really pick up, partly due to getting on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24494377">Hacker News</a>. I was starting to get a little bit twitchy seeing the number of containers spun up on Cloud Run steadily increasing. As lunch time approached we were getting close to 25,000 page views an hour, at times this was requiring 100 containers to service the traffic, and thing were going up fast.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The measly number of free cpu and ram minutes had long since evaporated, and I was getting a little concerned about what the cloud bill was going to be after I came back from an afternoon out of the house. So rather than limit things to a level that most people would get a non-response from the site, I decided to turn off the model and switch to an apology message.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h2>The numbers</h2><p>In the end we had close to a quarter of a million page views before I shut down the toonification. Not every one of these corresponds to someone submitting an image, but it’s not far off, and each user submitted around 3 or 4 images for toonification.</p><p>So how much did this all cost? Not quite as much as I thought, I had set a personal limit of spending around $100 on this and I didn’t break that. But here are some details of what it costs to run a service like this.</p><p>The model takes about 5 seconds to run inference on whatever hardware Cloud Run uses, and occupies around 1.4 GB of memory whilst doing it. It also takes a slightly astonishing 20 seconds to load the model the first time a container is brought up (and this happens more than I’d like), and the memory peaks at well over 2GB during this period. All this meant that processing a thousand images probably costs around 30 cents (footnote: there are also some other smaller costs like network egress to think about, but that’s not much extra), which isn’t too bad, but when you’re trying to process 25,000 an hour, starts to add up fast!</p><p>I’m still pretty amazed that it was so easy to build a site which could service so much traffic and do some serious image processing in the cloud. I’ve never used any of this scalable serverless technology before, but it was incredibly easy to get going!</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>A lot of people commented that the images produced didn’t preserve enough of the original character of the person, that they ended up looking pretty generic, and that a human cartoonist could do a far better job. I fully agree, there is not way deep learning is going to outperform a skilled artist any time soon! But there is also no way you could get skilled human artists to make cartoon versions of people for 30 cents per thousand.</p><p>Despite me putting a line in the FAQ assuring people I was not storing or collecting their images (how on earth would I have afforded that!?) several people commented on it with scepticism, surely something free online must be harvesting your data somehow? But honestly once the toonification was done the original image and the result were gone forever (for me at least). Plus I don’t really see why people were worried, people have already happily uploaded millions of photos of themselves to the internet and social media sites, who explicitly do make money from your data. If companies want to collect face data, a silly website like mine is not the way to do it!</p><h2>The future</h2><p>We’re currently working on getting the website back up and running again. I’m not keen on the obvious (and suggested by many) strategy of just plastering ads everywhere. But the success of the website has sparked many interesting conversations for me, and I think one of them will lead to a solution pretty soon.</p><p><strong>So watch this space (or my Twitter feed) Toonify Yourself will be back!</strong></p><h2>Twitter</h2><p>Lots of people shared fun examples on Twitter, here are a few:</p><h2>Coverage</h2><p>Here are some links to the coverage this got.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/153848-how-to-toonify-yourself-see-what-you-d-look-like-in-a-cartoon-movie">Pocket lint - How to Toonify yourself: See what you’d look like in a cartoon movie</a></li><li><a href="https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20200917-toonify-yourself/">Gigazine - I tried using ‘Toonify Yourself!’ Which can convert your face into Disney animation style</a></li><li><a href="https://meduza.io/shapito/2020/09/17/meduza-ispytala-toonify-servis-kotoryy-prevraschaet-vas-v-personazhey-multfilmov-nu-ili-v-cheloveka-epohi-neolita">Meduza - Medusa tried Toonify, a service that turns you into cartoon characters.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main id="main-content-container"><article aria-label="New data on the RTB privacy crisis: people with AIDS profiled in Ireland, and Polish elections influenced."><div>
<p><br><strong><em>This note presents new evidence of the scale of the vast RTB data breach, and of the consequences of two years of failure to enforce.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>September 2020 is the two year anniversary of my formal complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission about the Real-Time Bidding privacy crisis. In these two years, RTB has been allowed to continue to infringe Article 5(1)f of the GDPR, which requires security of personal data. In fact, this vast data breach appears&nbsp;to have worsened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we at the ICCL submitted&nbsp;evidence to the DPC that show the consequence of failure to enforce the GDPR to stop the vast RTB data breach at the heart of the online advertising industry.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7xo77grl2mnb6b6/AAAlszXoQ_zM2kUSsSRqKJSqa?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This evidence includes a proven case of electoral influence, profiling of people with AIDS and cancer, and a list of 968 companies that&nbsp;Google sends information to about the private things that we do and&nbsp;watch online</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RTB-broadcast-from-website-DPC-2020.gif" alt=""></figure></div>















<h2>Key insights in the submission&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>Real-Time Bidding operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It constantly broadcasts the private things we do and watch online, and where we are in the real-world, to countless companies. As a result, we are all an open book to data broker companies, and others, who can build intimate dossiers about each of us. <strong>Google’s RTB system sends this data to 968 companies (see <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6.-The-964-companies-that-Google-sends-our-data-to-Appendix-F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appendix F for a 25&nbsp;page list of these companies</a>).&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>

</p></figure>



<ul><li>A data broker company that uses RTB data to profile people <strong>influenced the 2019 Polish Parliamentary Election </strong>by<strong> targeting LGBTQ+ people</strong>. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See page 5</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Google’s RTB system allows users to target 1,200 people in Ireland profiled in a “<strong>Substance abuse</strong>” category, based on a data broker profile built with RTB data. Other health condition profiles from the same data broker available via Google included “<strong>Diabetes</strong>”,&nbsp; “<strong>Chronic Pain</strong>”, and “<strong>Sleep Disorders</strong>”. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See page 6</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The IAB’s RTB system allows users to target 1,300 people in Ireland profiled in a “<strong>AIDS &amp; HIV</strong>” category, based on a data broker profile build with RTB data. Other categories from the same data broker include “<strong>Incest &amp; Abuse Support</strong>”, “<strong>Brain Tumor</strong>”, “<strong>Incontinence</strong>”, and “<strong>Depression</strong>”.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See page 6</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>A data broker that gathers RTB data tracked <strong>the movements of people in Italy</strong> to see if they observed the <strong>Covid-19 lockdown</strong>. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See page 11-12</a>.&nbsp;<br></li><li>A data broker that illicitly <strong>profiled Black Lives Matters protesters</strong> in the United States has also been allowed to gather <strong>RTB data about Europeans</strong>. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See page 9</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The industry template for profiles includes intimate personal characteristics such as “<strong>Infertility</strong>”, “<strong>STD</strong>”, and “<strong>Conservative</strong>” politics. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See pages 13-15</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>RTB is the most massive data breach yet recorded, involving millions of websites and apps, and hundreds of billions of individual data leaks per day. Google’s RTB system now <strong>sends people’s private data to more companies</strong>, and <strong>from more websites than when the DPC was notified two years ago</strong>. A single ad exchange using the IAB RTB system now sends 120 billion RTB broadcasts in a day, an <strong>increase of 140% over two years ago when the DPC was notified</strong>. <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1.-Submission-to-Data-Protection-Commissioner.pdf#page=16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See pages 16-18</a>.</li></ul>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

</nav>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/index.html">used and defended Eshell</a> for years.  Sadly, Eshell has some long
standing issues that I grew tired of in the long run.  So I’ve decided to switch
to <code>M-x shell</code> and see how much of my Eshell workflow I could port.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3f85974">
<h2 id="org3f85974">Language and the underlying shell program</h2>
<div id="text-org3f85974">
<p>
The benefit of using Bash is that it’s the <i>de facto</i> standard for sharing shell
commands on the Internet.  As such, <code>M-x shell</code> can run any of those shell
snippets out there without extra modification.
</p>

<p>
Eshell constantly requires modifications to the syntax, for instance turning
<code>$(...)</code> to <code>${...}</code> or the input redirection <code>&lt;</code> to a pipe.
</p>

<p>
You might complain that Bash is a terrible language and Eshell’s Elisp is vastly
superior.  But even at the language level, <code>M-x shell</code> beats Eshell since it
lets the user choose which underlying program to run (with <code>C-u M-x shell</code>).  So
the same mode can run <code>psql</code>, <code>bash</code>, or <a href="https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash"><code>rash</code></a> if you fancy a Racket-powered
shell.  And Racket is a much more interesting language than Eshell in my
opinion&nbsp;:)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0600f56">
<h2 id="org0600f56">Virtualenv and <code>guix environment</code></h2>
<div id="text-org0600f56">
<p>
<code>virtualenv</code> and other environment managers don’t work well with Eshell.
Maybe it would be possible to leverage the <code>direnv</code> Emacs package, but I haven’t
looked into it yet.
</p>

<p>
I’ve heard that <code>nix-env</code> has support for Eshell, so I suppose it would be
equally possible to add Eshell support to <code>guix environment</code>.
</p>

<p>
Until then, <code>M-x shell</code> has better support for environment managers than Eshell.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9a1e927">
<h2 id="org9a1e927">Completion</h2>
<div id="text-org9a1e927">
<p>
Eshell only offers poor completion by default.
<code>M-x shell</code> can do slightly better if the underlying shell is Bash, but the
latter does not always provide great completion.
</p>

<p>
It’s possible to greatly enhance completion with support from the Fish shell.
The <code>fish-completion</code> package supports both <code>M-x shell</code> and Eshell.
</p>

<p>
You can even display the Fish inline documentation with the
<code>helm-fish-completion</code> package.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org85b8c80">
<h2 id="org85b8c80">Performance</h2>
<div id="text-org85b8c80">
<p>
<code>M-x shell</code> is significantly faster than Eshell at processing long outputs.
To the point that performance is rarely an issue (never was for me at least).
In Eshell, it is not uncommon to see Emacs grind to a halt because of too long
an output.
</p>

<p>
<code>M-x shell</code> is still an order of magnitude slower than, say, <code>emacs-vterm</code>.  The
performance issue is significantly reduced when <code>font-lock-mode</code> is off.  There
may be a few other tricks to boost <code>M-x shell</code> performance.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8b7abaf">
<h2 id="org8b7abaf">Command duration</h2>
<div id="text-org8b7abaf">
<p>
In Eshell, I implemented a special prompt that reports the duration of the previous
command.  This is very useful because I don’t have to think <i>beforehand</i> whether
I should prefix my command with <code>time</code>.  And I typically don’t want to run a
slow command twice just to know how much time it took.
</p>

<p>
This Eshell prompt is available in the <code>eshell-prompt-extras</code> package:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(setq eshell-prompt-function #'epe-theme-multiline-with-status)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sadly, there is no equivalent to <code>eshell-post-command-hook</code> for <code>M-x shell</code>
which makes it impossible to implement using the same (sane) logic.
</p>

<p>
So I had to resort to a hack.  I added the following to my <code>.bashrc</code>
</p>

<div>
<pre>PS1='\e[1;37m[\e[1;32m\w\e[1;37m]\e[m \e[0;34m\D{%F %T}\e[m\n\e[1;37m\$\e[m '
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to get a prompt looking like this:
</p>

<div>
<pre>[~/dotfiles] 2020-06-26 16:36:30
$ echo Hi!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With a bit of Elisp, I was able to write a <a href="https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/dotfiles/-/blob/adce533dc244f3e4fd5c146172eb48981c73b5b2/.emacs.d/lisp/init-shell.el#L68"><code>ambrevar/shell-command-duration</code></a>
command that parses the prompt and reports the time a command took.
It’s far from perfect but it’s a start.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org50c741d">
<h2 id="org50c741d">Helm-system-packages</h2>
<p>
As mentioned above, <code>M-x shell</code> does not have an equivalent to
<code>eshell-post-command-hook</code> which makes it impossible to use it for
<code>helm-system-package</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d67552">
<h2 id="org4d67552">Extra syntax highlighting (fontification)</h2>
<div id="text-org4d67552">
<p>
Comint-mode, the major mode behind <code>M-x shell</code>, supports extra fontification by
default.  For instance, running
</p>



<p>
prints the network interfaces in a different colour.  Neat, isn’t it?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9f48a0b">
<h2 id="org9f48a0b">Helm “Switch to shell”</h2>
<div id="text-org9f48a0b">
<p>
One of the features I use the most is the “Switch to to Eshell” action from
<code>helm-find-files</code>.  Until recently, it only supported Eshell.
</p>

<p>
This is now fixed in <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/commit/6061a3af5139491d7811c86d7c9cd5fec8f5fb40">Helm 3.6.3</a> and I just had to add this to my initialization
file:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(setq helm-ff-preferred-shell-mode 'shell-mode)
</pre>

<p>
A very convenient Emacs command is <code>narrow-to-defun</code> (<code>C-x n d</code>): it focuses the
buffer on a single function definition and all buffer-global commands are
restricted to it.  For instance, if I want to replace all occurrences of <code>foo</code>
in a given function, without altering the other <code>foo</code> in the rest of the buffer,
I can first narrow to the function, then run <code>query-replace</code> over all visible
occurrences.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to do the same with shells.  Indeed, it’s very useful to be able to
restrict commands to the output of a given command, say, to search an output
without hitting matches from other outputs in the same buffer.
</p>

<p>
I wrote an implementation both for <a href="https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/dotfiles/-/blob/adce533dc244f3e4fd5c146172eb48981c73b5b2/.emacs.d/lisp/init-eshell.el#L312">Eshell</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/dotfiles/-/blob/adce533dc244f3e4fd5c146172eb48981c73b5b2/.emacs.d/lisp/init-shell.el#L84"><code>M-x shell</code></a>.

<p>
It’s useful to search prompts, maybe to copy a command or to consult its output
again.
</p>

<p>
Helm can fuzzy-search and browse the prompts of all shell (including Eshell)

<h2 id="orgf33f22a">Global, filtered history</h2>
<div id="text-orgf33f22a">
<p>
More often than not, we use multiple shells.  By default, the shell history is
not synchronized between the shells and, worse, it gets overwritten by the <code>M-x
shell</code> that was last closed, which means that all previously closed shell
histories are gone.
</p>

<p>
It’s possible to fix this issue with the right shell setup (e.g. see
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/preserve-bash-history-in-multiple-terminal-windows">this discussion</a> for Bash) but it’s limited and it’s not general enough since it
must be done for all shell sub-programs, when supported at all.
</p>

<p>
A better approach is to ignore the underlying shell history and use Emacs
capabilities.  Eshell has the same limitations by default which I had fixed with
some custom Elisp, so I just ported it to <code>comint-mode</code> and voilà!
</p>

<p>
While I was at it, I’ve also applied history filtering such as removing <i>all</i>
duplicates (not just when last command matches the last history entry) and other
undesirable commands, such as <code>cd ...</code> or commands starting with a space.

<h2 id="org9e4cab1">Emacs integration</h2>
<div id="text-org9e4cab1">
<p>
One of the benefits of Eshell is that it integrates shell commands with Emacs.
For instance, running <code>grep</code> will display an interactive result in an Emacs
buffer.
</p>

<p>
It’s possible to write an <code>emacsclient</code> wrapper that evaluates the command
passed as argument in an Emacs buffer to, so it’s possible to mimic this feature
of Eshell rather closely.
</p>

<p>
Still, this is not as closely integrated to Emacs as it could get.  Indeed,
Eshell can intertwine its shell language with Elisp.  It’s thus able to run any
Elisp function.
</p>

<p>
Maybe a good direction to explore is <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">piper</a>.

<p>
I’m happy with <code>M-x shell</code>, the everyday use is much smoother than that of
Eshell.  Performance being one of the biggest selling point in my experience.
</p>

<p>
Overall, with the support of few packages such as Helm and <code>helm-fish-completion</code>
I get a stellar shell experience.  I miss very few features, such as support for
“visual” commands, modifiers and predicates which I rarely use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Recently, we launched k-NN similarity search feature on Open Distro for Elasticsearch. We are excited for the community to try out this feature and welcome you to come join in and contribute in building additional capabilities into Open Distro for Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>A k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a technique for performing similarity search: given a query data point, what are the k data points in an index that are most similar to the query? k-NN is largely popular for its use in content-based recommendation systems. For example, in a music streaming service, when a user generates an on-demand playlist, the recommendation system adds the songs that match the attributes of that playlist using k-NN. In a k-NN search algorithm, the elements of a data set are represented by vectors. Each song is a vector, containing several dimensions (attributes) like artist, album, genre, year of release, etc. The search assumes you have a defined distance function between the data elements (vectors) and returns most similar items to the one provided as input, where closest distance translates to item similarity. Other use cases with similarity search include fraud detection, image recognition, and semantic document retrieval.</p>

<p>We evaluated four primary dimensions to measure the effectiveness of a k-NN algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong> - How quickly does the algorithm return the approximate k-nearest neighbors, measured in latency of a single or batch query?</li>
  <li><strong>Recall</strong> - How accurate are the results, measured by ratio of the returned k-nearest neighbors indeed in the list of the actual k nearest neighbors to the value of k?</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong> - Can the algorithm handle data sets with millions or billions of vectors and thousands of dimensions?</li>
  <li><strong>Updates</strong> - Does the algorithm allow addition, deletion, and updating points without having to rebuild an index, a process that can take hours or more?</li>
</ol>

<p>We selected “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320.pdf"><strong>Hierarchical Navigable Small World</strong></a>” (HNSW) graphs developed under the open source library “<strong>Non-Metric Space Library</strong>” (<a href="https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib">NMSLIB</a>) as it aligned with our architectural requirements and met most of our evaluation criteria. Given a dataset, the algorithm constructs a graph on the data such that the greedy search algorithm finds the approximate nearest neighbor to a query in logarithmic time. HSNW consistently outperforms other libraries in this space based on <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks">ANN benchmark</a> metrics. HNSW excels at speed, recall, and cost, though it is restricted in scalability and updates. While the HNSW algorithm allows incremental addition of points, it forbids deletion and modification of indexed points. We offset the scalability and updates challenges by leveraging Elasticsearch’s distributed architecture, which scales with large data sets and inherently supports incremental updates to the data sets that become available in the search results in near real-time. The rest of this post discusses the integration of NMSLIB with Elasticsearch and the customizations made to support the feature in Elasticsearch.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-navigable-small-world-algorithm-hnsw">Hierarchical Navigable Small World Algorithm (HNSW)</h2>

<p>The HNSW graph algorithm is a fast and accurate solution to the approximate k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search problem.</p>

<p>A straightforward, yet naive solution to the k-NN problem is to first compute the distances from a given query point to every data point within an index and then select the data points with the smallest k distances to the query. While this approach is effective when the index contains ten thousand or fewer data points, it does not scale to the sizes of datasets used by our customers. An approximate k-NN (ANN) algorithm may greatly reduce search latency at the cost of precision. When designing an ANN algorithm there are two general approaches to improve latency:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compute fewer distances and</li>
  <li>Make distance computations cheaper</li>
</ol>

<p>The HNSW algorithm focuses on the first of these approaches by building a graph data structure on the constituent points of the data set.</p>

<p>With a graph data structure on the data set, approximate nearest neighbors can be found using graph traversal methods. Given a query point, we find its nearest neighbors by starting at a random point in the graph and computing its distance to the query point. From this entry point, we explore the graph, computing the distance to the query of each newly visited data point until the traversal can find no closer data points. To compute fewer distances while still retaining high accuracy, the HNSW algorithm builds on top of previous work on Navigable Small World (NSW) graphs. The NSW algorithm builds a graph with two key properties. The “small world” property is such that the number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of points grows poly-logarithmically with the number of points in the graph. The “navigable” property asserts that the greedy algorithm is likely to stay on this shortest path. Combining these two properties results in a graph structure so the greedy algorithm is likely to find the nearest data point to a query in logarithmic time.</p>

<p><img src="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/assets/media/blog-images/knn_graph_1.png" alt="k-NN Graph Figure 1"></p>
<p>
<i>Figure 1: A depiction of an NSW graph built on blue data points. The dark blue edges represent long-range connections that help ensure the small-world property. Starting at the entry point, at each iteration the greedy algorithm will move to the neighbor closest to the query point. The chosen path from the entry point to the query’s nearest neighbor is highlighted in magenta and, by the “navigable” property, is likely to be the shortest path from the entry point to the query’s nearest neighbor.
</i></p>

<p>HNSW extends the NSW algorithm by building multiple layers of interconnected NSW-like graphs. The top layer is a coarse graph built on a small subset of the data points in the index. Each lower layer incorporates more points in its graph until reaching the bottom layer, which consists of an NSW-like graph on every data point. To find the approximate nearest neighbors to a query, the search process finds the nearest neighbors in the graph at the top layer and uses these points as the entry points to the subsequent layer. This strategy results in a nearest neighbors search algorithm which runs logarithmically with respect to the number of data points in the index.</p>

<h3 id="non-metric-space-library-nmslib">Non Metric Space Library (NMSLIB)</h3>

<p>NMSLIB, an Apache 2 licensed library, is the open source implementation of HNSW. It is lightweight and works particularly well for our use cases that that requires minimal impact on the Elasticsearch application workloads. To index the vectors and to query the nearest neighbors for the given query vector, our k-NN plugin makes calls to the NMSLIB implementation of HNSW. We use the Java Native Interface (JNI) to bridge between Elasticsearch written in Java and C++ libraries in NMSLIB.  Although we use Euclidean distance vector to calculate the proximity, NMSLIB can be easily extended to add new search methods and distance functions (like cosine similarity) in the future.</p>

<h2 id="elasticsearch-integration-with-approximate-k-nn-search">Elasticsearch Integration with Approximate k-NN Search</h2>

<p>Elasticsearch’s distributed engine allows us to distribute the millions of vectors across multiple shards spread across multiple nodes within a cluster and scales horizontally as the data grows. Users can also take advantage of Elasticsearch’s support for index updates to make any modifications to the data set and reflect the changes in the results in near real-time. While Elasticsearch’s plugin-based architecture makes it easy to add extensions, we had to make some customizations to support the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search.</p>

<p>First, we added a new field type, <strong>knn_vector</strong>, using the Mapper plugin, to represent the vectors as a an array of floating point numbers in a document. ANN requires support for storing high cardinality vectors. The <strong>knn_vector</strong> field support vectors up to 10k dimensions. We also introduced a new Apache Lucene codec, <strong>KNNCodec</strong>, to add a new index file format for storing and retrieving the vectors and make Apache Lucene aware of the graphs built by NMSLIB. These file formats co-exist with the other Apache Lucene file formats and are immutable just like the other Apache Lucene files, making them file system cache friendly and thread safe.</p>

<p>Let’s create a KNN index <strong>myindex</strong> and add data of type knn_vector to the field my_vector. You could then index your documents as you would normally do using any of Elasticsearch index APIs.</p>

September 21, 2020 | https://www.entreprenerd.blog/live-streams/how-to-launch-an-agency | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.entreprenerd.blog/live-streams/how-to-launch-an-agency">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the beginning, an agency is incredibly simple. There are only two things you need: A website and marketable skills.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because an agency is a service-based business - so you're essentially trading time, and your expertise, for payment. It's just freelancing - the only difference I can find is that there's a legal business entity, or there's a number of people greater than 1 involved.</p><p>But, in the beginning, you just need yourself, a small way to show people you exist, and your skillset.</p><p>So, let's build that website. To start, give your agency a name, you can change it later if you make it big.&nbsp;<strong>Your name doesn't matter.&nbsp;</strong>Mine is "UnnamedAgency.com" because I thought it was funny, and we've already worked with a client. Don't overthink it.</p><p>Now make a logo. I spent 6 minutes in <a href="http://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> making mine, then put it through <a href="http://www.remove.bg/">remove.bg</a> to remove the background -&nbsp;<strong>you can change it later.</strong>&nbsp;I typed out the word "Unnamed", moved the letters up and down, and added a base shadow effect. Don't overthink it.</p><p>Now you need to establish what you're offering. It does not need to be unique. It likely will not be, and that is fine, but you still need to solve a problem like any other business.&nbsp;</p><p>So - I live stream. I noticed a lot of live streamers in my network weren't using and clips of their live streams on social media, even though all their live streams are awesome pieces of long-form material. Most of the successful live streamers would do it, but other, usually smaller ones wouldn't. I personally have an editor chop up my live streams, because watching through them, finding the best parts, and clipping them together takes hours and hours. It's not hard, it's just very time consuming, and you need to know a little bit about what works on social media. But that's the problem we're going to solve.</p><p>Our agency will help live streamers by finding quality content in their long-form streams and then by breaking it up into digestible clips. Great. I spent half an hour boiling down the tagline to "we transform live streams and podcasts into engaging clips". I figured we should include podcasts - as they're just as easy to edit and the content format is similarly long-form.</p><p>There are probably thousands of other freelancers or agencies that do this, but it doesn't matter. They don't have my network.</p><p>Now you need a section of the website that discusses the problem, and how you can help. I can't tell you how to do this, but it shouldn't take you long. I used a stock social media graphic and I designed a crummy little diagram in Canva to add to this section.</p><p>Now, if you've done some work for a client already, add an example or screenshot to show it exists. Awesome - now just a small professionally branded email and a "schedule a call" button linked to a <a href="http://www.calendly.com/">Calendly</a> or whatever else you use.</p><p>FYI, I used <a href="http://www.carrd.co/">Carrd</a>, a super cheap, simple one-page website builder. You don't need extra functionality. You can change your website later. Don't overthink it.</p><p>You're done. That's the easy part. Now you have to find clients. That's the hard part, and it depends a lot on the service you provide. But for my agency, I'm going to message every live streamer I see that isn't clipping their long-form content. I'm going to ask if I can do one or two live stream edits for free if the streamer has a decent network and is willing to promote what I'm building. I'm going to call similar agency owners and ask for their advice. (why not?)</p><p>Don't do free work for long, if you have to do it at all. Price yourself based on the market - for instance, I would ask live streamers that already outsource their editing how much they're already paying. You don't have to be cheaper, you just have to do a good job and not wildly overprice your work. You can customize payment to each client you find, and you likely will to start. You'll eventually standardize later, don't worry about it right now.</p><p>Link your agency to your social profiles, make a LinkedIn page for it, tell all your friends and your LinkedIn network that you've set it up, and start reaching out to potential clients to see if you can find anyone that might be a fit.</p><p>That's it. The initial setup process shouldn't take you more than a day. I almost finished it on a 90-minute live stream. Finding clients will be an ongoing process, but you don't have to rush it. Set a reminder every day to find one new person to reach out to, or one new sales tactic to try. Be consistent and steady. Once you get your first client and your first testimonial, you'll be able to begin scaling up - just don't stress about the setup.</p><p>‍</p><p>I hope you learned something. :) If you think this was valuable, a retweet helps me spread the word, and I would super appreciate it.</p></div></div>]]>

  </p>

  <p>This is my Rust 2021 post. I believe that Rust has shown that “bending the curve” is
both possible and fruitful in programming language design. We also have a strong set
of values as a community, enshrined both in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and the example of
various high-profile rustaceans.</p>

<p>For 2021 I really couldn’t care less what features go into the next edition. Don’t
get me wrong, I want the next edition to be awesome, but I believe this is table
stakes by now. I want us to take on the harder problems.</p>

<p>I want us to grow as a community, and I don’t mean that in a population count sense.
This is what I meant when I snarkily wrote “Less doing the wrong thing, safely”. The
keyword here is <em>ethical development</em>. Just like the Rust programming language has a
set of vaues, a set of tradeoffs between them, and a set of bent curves where we
found a place in the design space that lets us have our cake and eat it where this
was a formerly accepted tradeoff, I want the Rust community to have a shared set of
values, a shared set of tradeoffs between them, and as much bent curves as possible.</p>

<p>Now what I mean by ‘values’ obviously differs when I talk about programming language
design or a programming language community. For language design, the values can
contain execution speed, productivity, safety, learnability and so on. For software
ethics values may be inclusion and diversity, welfare for all people, privacy,
freedom, lawfulness, friendlyness and hospitality, integrity, humor, and a lot more.
Some of them are by now well-known and have seen implementations, for example
privacy. But how might we hope to encode e.g. hospitality?</p>

<p>There are a few hard questions to ask, and I won’t cover everything here, but I’ll
give you a few examples of things the Rust community will have to face at some
point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have heard reports of companies treating their Rust developers badly. As if
using Rust should make up for abuse by an employer. This is obviously unacceptable,
and we should call out instances wherever we find them. Such employers should not
be considered part of the community (Names withheld to protect the innocent)</li>
  <li>Rust is still hosted on github, a company that has a contract with ICE, a
institution that has proven to act out genocide against immigrants in the US. For
now, we act as if this doesn’t affect us and have the mod team quell all
discussion. I’m having a hard time bringing this up after having personally
removed discussion about it on /r/rust. But while we don’t want the drama to
continue, and expressly wish this point not to debated in the replies, we as a
community need to tackle this problem</li>
  <li>I’m still not writing that “why we shouldn’t write more blockchains in Rust”
article just yet, but as I’ve written before, Blockchain tech hasn’t showed much
benefit to society just yet while binding a lot of resources and burning through a
lot of electricity (obviously proof of stake is better than proof of work in that
regard, but being better than the worst thing doesn’t make something good), thus
hastening the climate crisis</li>
</ul>

<p>So here’s my suggestions: I want an Ethics WG, tasked with both researching and
teaching Rustic Software Ethics. With the above examples, I hope to have given a
useful set of initial work items for that group.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I stumbled upon a blog post written by <a href="https://twitter.com/vogti" target="_blank">Christophe Voigt</a> about how he managed to scale out a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster to the cloud with Tailscale.</p>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>He grabbed a couple of Raspberry Pis and created a k3s cluster by following the instructions of Alex Ellis.</li>
<li>After learning about <a href="https://tailscale.com/" target="_blank">Tailscale</a>, a “no config” private networking solution based on Wireguard, allowing encrypted P2P communication between hosts, across NAT, firewalls, and other networking hurdles, he saw entirely new possibilities. Every machine capable of running k3s and Tailscale can join his k3s cluster, no matter where it’s location is.</li>
<li>He was able to build a setup to add and remove nodes of various cloud providers - all via configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do recommend reading his <a href="https://blog.nativecloud.dev/scale-out-your-raspberry-pi-k3s-cluster-to-the-cloud/" target="_blank">full stories</a> as it explains in details how he achieved his goals.</p>

<p>Now, as I also fancy some Raspberry Pis and happen to have a <a href="https://johansiebens.dev/posts/2020/08/building-a-nomad-cluster-on-raspberry-pi-running-ubuntu-server/" target="_blank">cluster running HashiCorp Consul and Nomad</a>, I was wondering what it would take to scale out my Nomad cluster to the cloud using the same techniques.</p>

<h2 id="what-options-do-we-have">What options do we have?</h2>

<p>Our requirements are equally simple: we need some kind of operator that will automatically create VMs of a cloud vendor. Those machines need to start Tailscale, join the network, set up Consul and Nomad, and of course eventually join the cluster.</p>

<p>As explained by Christophe, in the Kubernetes ecosystem are some operators available that will meet those requirements (e.g. Kubermatic Machine Controller or Gardener Machine Controller Manager). But unfortunately, those tools have no support for HashiCorp Nomad.</p>

<p>Then I realized that one of the latest announcement of HashiCorp was the availability of a Nomad Autoscaler. Not only can it scale Nomad jobs, but it has also support to scale cluster nodes if required. Could this tool, also brought forward by HashiCorp, mean something for my use case?</p>

<p>It turned out that it is a perfect fit for what I was looking for.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-raspberry-pi-cluster">Preparing the Raspberry Pi cluster</h2>

<p>The first thing to do was making some changes to the Consul and Nomad cluster I had already running on the Raspberry Pis. Because other external VMs will join this cluster through Tailscale, it is quite evident that it needs to be installed on the machines in the home lab as well.</p>

<p>In my case, the Pis are running Ubuntu 20.04, which is like many other Linux distributions supported by Tailscale. Installing this software is just a matter of executing some commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>set -e

TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY<span>=</span>&lt;your tailscale auth key&gt;

echo <span>"Installing Tailscale"</span>

curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tailscale

sudo tailscale up --authkey $TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY

echo <span>"Tailscale installation finished."</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that all these nodes have joined the Tailscale network, the next task is configuring Consul and Nomad with this the newly available network interface <code>tailscale0</code>. When Consul and Nomad are advertising the Tailscale IP address to other peers in the group, we are sure they can join each other.</p>

<p>Changing the configuration of Consul and Nomad a little bit did the trick.</p>

<p>Have a look at the following snippet of the configuration of the Consul and Nomad client agents (not everything is displayed, other parts of the config are left out for brevity)</p>

<p>consul.hcl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">bind_addr      = "{{ GetInterfaceIP \"tailscale0\" }}"
advertise_addr = "{{ GetInterfaceIP \"tailscale0\" }}"
client_addr    = "0.0.0.0"
retry_join     = ["100.88.118.99"] // the address in the Tailscale network of our server node</code></pre></div>
<p>nomad.hcl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">advertise {
  http = "{{ GetInterfaceIP \"tailscale0\" }}"
  rpc  = "{{ GetInterfaceIP \"tailscale0\" }}"
  serf = "{{ GetInterfaceIP \"tailscale0\" }}"
}
client {
  enabled           = true
  node_class        = "hashistack-rpi"
  network_interface = "tailscale0"
  network_speed     = 1000
}</code></pre></div>
<p>After restarting all the services, the private cluster is now ready to accept nodes running in the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="nomad-autoscaler">Nomad Autoscaler</h2>

<p>In the first quarter of this year, HashiCorp announced a Tech Preview of the HashiCorp Nomad Autoscaler and in the meanwhile, a beta version is already available for use. While the tech preview brought us horizontal application autoscaling features, the beta release also included the capability to horizontally scaling the cluster. With this feature, you can automatically add or remove clients from the Nomad cluster as the load changes. At the time of writing, they only support Autoscaling Groups on AWS, but I’m pretty sure other cloud providers will be available sooner or later.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the Nomad Autoscaler provides a plugin system:</p>

<ul>
<li>ARM plugins to gather metrics to make scaling decisions</li>
<li>Target plugins to perform the actual scaling actions</li>
<li>Strategy plugins implement the logic dictating when and how to scale a particular target</li>
</ul>

<p>The interaction between those plugins is illustrated in this figure:</p>

<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>So, what does it takes to scale our private Nomad cluster to the cloud?</p>

<h3 id="setup-the-aws-autoscaling-group">Setup the AWS Autoscaling Group</h3>

<p>First, we need to create an Autoscaling Group on AWS. I prefer Terraform to create those necessary cloud resources. You can find the Terraform manifests in my <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/rpi-nomad-scale-to-cloud" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>After applying those Terraform manifests, we will have the following AWS resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>credentials for a technical user including a sufficient set of IAM permissions</li>
<li>security groups for our Nomad clients</li>
<li>a launch template for our instances</li>
<li>the actual Autoscaling Group</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ec2-user-data">EC2 User data</h4>

<p>As the Nomad Autoscaler will only add or remove nodes by manipulating the AWS Autoscaling Group, it doesn’t mean it will automatically join our Consul and Nomad cluster. The make sure new nodes will become fully functional Nomad clients, the required agents need to be started when an instance is booted.</p>

<p>The user data in the launch template contains all the necessary steps to install Tailscale and the Consul and Nomad clients, including joining the Tailscale network and the cluster. <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/rpi-nomad-scale-to-cloud/blob/master/terraform/templates/user-data.sh" target="_blank">The script I use is available in the Github repository</a>. At this moment, I chose to put all those steps in the user data; an improvement here could be using Packer to build a new AMI with all the software installed. Such a pre-baked image could reduce the startup time of the new nodes.</p>

<p>Just like Christophe, I currently write the Tailscale auth key in plain text in the user data. Proper secret management should be put in place here. Vault perhaps?</p>

<h3 id="preparing-a-secret-in-vault">Preparing a secret in Vault</h3>

<p>Besides Consul and Nomad, I’m also running Vault on the Raspberry Pis home lab. As a result, the Nomad jobs can pull secret from Vault when they start. The Nomad Autoscaler will need the AWS credentials, created by Terraform, to access the AWS API when manipulating the AWS Autoscaling Group. The secret will contain the AWS Access Key ID and the AWS Access Key Secret.</p>

<p>Authenticate with the Vault CLI and create the secret:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">jsiebens@orion$ vault secrets enable -version<span>=</span><span>2</span> kv
Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: kv/
jsiebens@orion$ vault kv put kv/autoscaler aws_access_key_id<span>=</span>&lt;your id&gt; aws_secret_access_key<span>=</span>&lt;your secret&gt;
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     <span>2020</span>-08-12T15:33:33.041118515Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          <span>1</span>
jsiebens@orion$ </code></pre></div>
<p>Next, create a policy for the job that will allow it to read the credentials:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">path "kv/data/autoscaler" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">jsiebens@orion$ vault policy write autoscaler autoscaler-policy.hcl 
Success! Uploaded policy: autoscaler
jsiebens@orion$ </code></pre></div>
<h3 id="running-the-nomad-autoscaler">Running the Nomad Autoscaler</h3>

<p>Now that our Autoscaling Group is available, we can set up the Nomad Autoscaler.</p>

<p>First, deploy a Prometheus instance that we will use as the APM plugin for the scaler. Prometheus is configured in such a way, that it will scrape all Nomad clients metrics. Those metrics are used to decide of nodes should be added or removed. Makes sense, right?</p>

<p>As the Nomad clients on AWS can come and go while scaling up and down, I want to make sure that the autoscaling jobs are running on my Raspberry Pis. By giving the Nomad clients in the home lab and on AWS a different <code>node_class</code>, and adding a constraint in the job definitions, we tell the Nomad scheduler on which nodes the jobs can be scheduled.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">job "autoscaler" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  constraint {
    attribute = "${node.class}"
    value     = "hashistack-rpi"
  }

  ...
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we will start the Autoscaler as a Nomad job too. Unfortunately, a Docker image of the Nomad Autoscaler is not (yet) available for the arm64 architecture. But, as you might know, Nomad is also able to run non-containerized applications, and the scaler is already cross-compiled for multiple platforms, such as arm64.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">job "autoscaler" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "autoscaler" {
    
    task "autoscaler" {
      driver = "exec"

      artifact {
        source = "https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad-autoscaler/0.1.0/nomad-autoscaler_0.1.0_linux_arm64.zip"
      }

      config {
        command = "nomad-autoscaler"

        args = [
          "agent",
          "-config",
          "${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}/config.hcl",
          "-http-bind-address",
          "0.0.0.0",
          "-policy-dir",
          "${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}/policies/",
        ]
      }

      ...

    }
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Apply the autoscaler Nomad job, and there you have it! As soon the job is started, you see it will check the configured metrics regularly and validate if it should add or remove new clients.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">jsiebens@orion$ nomad run nomad/autoscaler.nomad 
<span>==</span>&gt; Monitoring evaluation <span>"124b4a8a"</span>
    Evaluation triggered by job <span>"autoscaler"</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I upgraded my home internet connection to fibre (FTTP) <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/10/native-ipv6-fttp.html">last October</a>. I’m still on an 80M/20M service, so it’s no faster than my old VDSL FTTC connection was, and as a result for a long time I continued to use my HomeHub 5A running <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>. However the FTTP ONT meant I was using up an additional ethernet port on the router, and I was already short, so I ended up with a GigE switch in use as well. Also my wifi is handled by a <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">UniFi</a>, which takes its power via Power-over-Ethernet. That mean I had a router, a switch and a PoE injector all in close proximity. I wanted to reduce the number of devices, and ideally upgrade to something that could scale once I decide to upgrade my FTTP service speed.</p>

<p>Looking around I found the <a href="https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS-RM">MikroTik RB3011UiAS-RM</a>, which is a rack mountable device with 10 GigE ports (plus an SFP slot) and a dual core <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/ipq8064">Qualcomm IPQ8064</a> ARM powering it. There’s 1G RAM and 128MB NAND flash, as well as a USB3 port. It also has PoE support. On paper it seemed like an ideal device. I wasn’t particularly interested in running RouterOS on it (the provided software), but that’s based on Linux and there was some work going on within OpenWRT to add support, so it seemed like a worthwhile platform to experiment with (what, you expected this to be about me buying an off the shelf device and using it with only the supplied software?). As an added bonus a friend said he had one he wasn’t using, and was happy to sell it to me for a bargain price.</p>

<p><img alt="RB3011 router in use" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/rb3011.jpg"></p>

<p>I did try out RouterOS to start with, but I didn’t find it particularly compelling. I’m comfortable configuring firewalling and routing at a Linux command line, and I run some additional services on the router like my <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/05/mqtt-broker.html">MQTT</a> broker, and <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2018/09/netlink-arp-presence.html">mqtt-arp</a>, my wifi device presence monitor. I could move things around such that they ran on the <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/07/upgrading-the-house-server.html">house server</a>, but I consider them core services and as a result am happier with them on the router.</p>

<p>The first step was to get something booting on the router. Luckily it has an RJ45 serial console port on the back, and a reasonably featured bootloader that can manage to boot via tftp over the network. It wants an ELF binary rather than a plain kernel, but Sergey Sergeev had done the hard work of getting <a href="https://github.com/adron-s/uboot-ipq806x">u-boot working for the IPQ8064</a>, which mean I could just build normal u-boot images to try out.</p>

<p>Linux upstream already had basic support for a lot of the pieces I was interested in. There’s a slight fudge around <code>AUTO_ZRELADDR</code> because the network coprocessors want a chunk of memory at the start of RAM, but there’s ongoing discussions about how to handle this cleanly that I’m hopeful will eventually mean I can drop that hack. Serial, ethernet, the QCA8337 switches (2 sets of 5 ports, tied to different GigE devices on the processor) and the internal NOR all had drivers, so it was a matter of crafting an appropriate DTB to get them working. That left niggles.</p>

<p>First, the second switch is hooked up via SGMII. It turned out the IPQ806x <code>stmmac</code> driver didn’t initialise the clocks in this mode correctly, and neither did the <code>qca8k</code> switch driver. So I need to fix up both of those (Sergey had handled the stmmac driver, so I just had to clean up and submit his patch). Next it turned out the driver for talking to the Qualcomm firmware (SCM) had been updated in a way that broke the old method needed on the IPQ8064. Some git archaeology figured that one out and provided a solution. Ansuel Smith helpfully provided the DWC3 PHY driver for the USB port. That got me to the point I could put a Debian armhf image onto a USB stick and mount that as root, which made debugging much easier.</p>

<p>At this point I started to play with configuring up the device to actually act as a router. I make use of a number of VLANs on my home network, so I wanted to make sure I could support those. Turned out the stmmac driver wasn’t happy reconfiguring its MTU because the IPQ8064 driver doesn’t configure the FIFO sizes. I found what seem to be the correct values and plumbed them in. Then the <code>qca8k</code> driver only supported port bridging. I wanted the ability to have a trunk port to connect to the upstairs switch, while also having ports that only had a single VLAN for local devices. And I wanted the switch to handle this rather than requiring the CPU to bridge the traffic. Thankfully it’s easy to find a copy of the QCA8337 datasheet and the kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/dsa/index.html">Distributed Switch Architecture</a> is pretty flexible, so I was able to implement the necessary support.</p>

<p>I stuck with Debian on the USB stick for actually putting the device into production. It makes it easier to fix things up if necessary, and the USB stick allows for a full Debian install which would be tricky on the 128M of internal NAND. That means I can use things like <a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/">nftables</a> for my firewalling, and use the standard Debian packages for things like <a href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a> and <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">mosquitto</a>. Plus for debug I can fire up things like tcpdump or tshark. Which ended up being useful because when I put the device into production I started having weird IPv6 issues that turned out to be a lack of proper Ethernet multicast filter support in the IPQ806x ethernet device. The driver would try and setup the multicast filter for the IPv6 NDP related packets, but it wouldn’t actually work. The fix was to fall back to just receiving all multicast packets - this is what the vendor driver does.</p>

<p>Most of this work will be present once the 5.9 kernel is released - the basics are already in 5.8. Currently not queued up that I can think of are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stmmac IPQ806x FIFO sizes. I sent out an RFC patch for these, but didn’t get any replies. I probably just need to submit this.</li>
  <li>NAND. This is missing support for the QCOM ADM DMA engine. I’ve sent out the patch I found to enable this, and have had some feedback, so I’m hopeful it will get in at some point.</li>
  <li>LCD. AFAICT LCD is an ST7735 device, which has kernel support, but I haven’t spent serious effort getting the SPI configuration to work.</li>
  <li>Touchscreen. Again, this seems to be a zt2046q or similar, which has a kernel driver, but the basic attempts I’ve tried don’t get any response.</li>
  <li>Proper SFP functionality. The IPQ806x has a PCS module, but the stmmac driver doesn’t have an easy way to plumb this in. I have ideas about how to get it working properly (and it can be hacked up with a fixed link config) but it’s not been a high priority.</li>
  <li>Device tree additions. Some of the later bits I’ve enabled aren’t yet in the mainline RB3011 DTB. I’ll submit a patch for that at some point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I consider the device a success, and it’s been entertaining getting it working properly. I’m running a mostly mainline kernel, it’s handling my house traffic without breaking a sweat, and the fact it’s running Debian makes it nice and easy to throw more things on it as I desire. However it turned out the RB3011 isn’t as perfect device as I’d hoped. The PoE support is passive, and the UniFi wants 802.1af. So I was going to end up with 2 devices. As it happened I picked up a cheap <a href="https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dgs-1210-series-gigabit-smart-plus-switches">D-Link DGS-1210-10P</a> switch, which provides the PoE support as well as some additional switch ports. Plus it runs Linux, so more on that later…</p>

2000 by Steve Jobs<sup><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup>. Since then,
including the Public Beta of version 10.0, there have been 17 different releases
till now. The next one, version 11.0, titled Big Sur, is coming later this year.</p><p>In the intervening two decades, a lot has changed. In 2002, Steve Jobs famously
dropped support for OS 9 by staging a funeral at WWDC. Macs transitioned from
PowerPC to Intel chips and later to 64-bit only. Apple switched from naming
releases after big cats like Panther and Jaguar to naming releases after
California locations. It also renamed Mac OS X to macOS to conform better with
iOS and later iPadOS.</p><p>The interface started glassy and skeuomorphic, mimicking the materials used on
Macs. Over the decades, it went through significant
revisions<sup><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>One thing that seems to have remained relatively unchanged over the years is the
System Preferences screen.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/457568483?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>But, at a closer glance, we’ll see that this mundane part of the operating

10.0 release, an optical sensor’s red glow was added to reflect how the mouse
looks when in use. Following that is the white iteration of that mouse, the
short-lived Mighty Mouse, and then finally the Magic Mouse, which has undergone
only minor updates till today.</p><p><span>

combined into one, but then in 10.6, they were split up again.</p><h3 id="displays">Displays</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, the Displays icon has always reflected the latest Apple display
starting with the transparent polycarbonate Cinema Displays until today’s Pro
Display XDR. The small size allocated to the icons has meant that they usually
look a little cartoonish and out of proportion, but still consistent with the
rest of the icon set. However, in Big Sur, the display icon’s proportions were
adjusted much closer to how Pro Display XDR looks in reality.</p><p><span>

<p>Writing is…hard. Like most aspiring bloggers, my folders of drafts and my dreams of future prolificness outweigh my actual output.</p>

<p>I’ve found a curious trick for getting over this hurdle, though: writing tweet threads. I’ve published many little bursts of tweets about topics I’m curious about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1272542423001022467">connections between change in physical architecture and software</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1250443671020986368">pondering Airtable’s macro system</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1177607448682582016">the danger of “app-ifying” spreadsheets</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1258769298862100483">digging into the history of Applescript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are exactly the kinds of things I’d like to blog about! But somehow, I’ve found it 10 times easier to publish the tweet threads.</p>

<p>I can hear you groaning already. Of course tweeting is easier than writing, you dummy! Our minds are being driven into the meat grinder 280 characters at a time, as we replace deep logical thought with aphorisms and memes. Twitter is PowerPoint thinking on steroids.</p>

<p>But I think this dismissive response misses the point. We can’t really understand Twitter by treating it as a mediocre replacement for essays and research papers. We need to see it as a new medium on its own terms. In particular, <strong>Twitter is a medium for <em>sketching</em></strong>—for playing with ideas, on the fly. Twitter is more similar to scribbling on a whiteboard or tossing ideas around at the cafe than writing a book. (By sketching I don’t mean literally just drawing; I mean any lightweight early expression of a thought.)</p>

<p>Why does Twitter work so well for this? Here are some of my theories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The right constraints</strong>: Good sketching tools provide the right limits on what you can do. Twitter’s constraints go beyond the obvious character count.</li>
<li><strong>Low barriers</strong>: Twitter makes it easy to get started. But, crucially, it also makes it easy to <em>finish</em>!</li>
<li><strong>A social context</strong>: Twitter provides a highly interconnected context for thinking. Should we be worried it takes it too far?</li>
</ul>

<p>By reflecting on these properties, I think we can gain some insight not just into Twiter specifically, but also the broader landscape of tools for thinking. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-constraints">The right constraints</h2>

<p>Thinking about big new things is hard, and our brains are good at finding ways to weasel out of the job by finding something easier to do, but still plausibly productive. Unfortunately, in the early stages of sketching out an idea, such distractions abound: worrying about word choice in the last paragraph instead of writing the next one, futzing with the font size, making a new blog system instead of writing the damn blog post.</p>

<p>We can try to avoid these temptations, but an easier route is to simply find tools that don’t allow have the temptations in the first place. <strong>This is a key property of good sketching tools: they provide the right constraints.</strong></p>

<h3 id="tiny-linear-atomic-outlines">Tiny, linear, atomic outlines</h3>

<p>Let’s examine a few of Twitter’s valuable constraints.</p>

<p>Start with the obvious one: <strong>the 280 character limit</strong>. Twitter’s main constraint is encouraging concision. It’s hard to dwell on word choice when you have so little space to work with. Twitter’s conversational tone also helps here—I can just <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html">write like I talk</a>, and any fancy words would seem out of place. And of course, I can’t tweak fonts and margins, which cuts off a distraction vector.</p>

<p>But threads complicate the story of character limits a bit. The limit isn’t really that your entire point must fit into one tweet—it’s that <strong><em>each</em> of your individual points must squeeze under the limit</strong>. This provides a different useful constraint: each idea has to be wrapped in a little atomic package. I find this helpful for figuring out the boundaries between my thoughts and clarifying the discrete units of an argument.</p>

<p>That constraint sort of resembles the benefits of an outlining tool. But Twitter has another constraint: <strong>a thread is linear</strong>! No indenting allowed. This forces a brisk straightline through the argument, instead of getting mired in the fine points of the sub-sub-sub-arguments of the first idea. Very limiting, but simultaneously freeing.</p>

<p>Taken together, these constraints frame the pros and cons of the medium, its appropriate range of usage. Obviously, writing a book in a single-level outline would be foolish, but it works for a rough sketch. More interestingly, I think Twitter is useless for persuading a skeptical reader; there’s simply not space for providing enough detail and context. This is a common property of media for sketching: the initial mockup isn’t impressive enough to sway a user, even if it’s a useful tool for the internal team. I prefer to use Twitter as a way to workshop ideas with sympathetic parties who already have enough context to share my excitement about the ideas.</p>

<p>Perhaps there’s a general principle here: Twitter is good for sketching ideas for the same reasons it’s bad for fully developing them. You can’t accidentally start writing a book in Twitter, and that’s kind of the point.</p>

<h3 id="the-puzzle-of-constraints">The puzzle of constraints</h3>

<p>In general, what are the <em>right</em> constraints for a sketching tool? I think this question is deeper than it seems at first glance.</p>

<p>You might say something like “only offer the minimum fidelity needed to convey the point,” but I think it’s not obvious how to define that minimum level. <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#fat-marker-sketches">Sketching with a fat marker</a> can prevent us from getting too detailed with our drawings; <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>, which I’ve been using for iPad sketching recently, intentionally limits your ink choices to just a few colors.</p>

<p>This works great for certain kinds of thinking and mockups. But for designing new interactions with animation and physics, we need <a href="http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/Prototypingtools.html">a totally different class of tools</a> with more capabilities! The line between essential and spurious depends on the goal.</p>

<p>Providing the right constraints isn’t always a matter of removing. It can require adding advanced capabiliites too, like this <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">typeface design tool</a> that uses fancy machine learning to provide a few simple knobs for controlling things like “bold.” It doesn’t let you move individual vector points, but instead lets you operate at a more natural level of abstraction.</p>

<p>If you’re not careful, constraints can easily damage fluidity—as <a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Engelbart showed</a>, tying a brick to a pencil does not yield a productive tool.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/images/article_images/engelbart-brick-pencil.jpg?1600706839">
<figcaption>Surprise, surprise: writing with a “brick pencil” makes it harder to think big thoughts</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Overall, it seems that we want constraints that help keep us on track with fluid thought, but don’t rule out too many interesting possibilities. Considering both of these criteria together is a subtle balancing act, and I don’t see easy answers.</p>

<h2 id="low-barriers">Low barriers</h2>

<p>There’s a <strong>low barrier to starting</strong> on Twitter. Just click a button, type a thought, no need to spend a minute remembering how to start my blog server. Often, that first minute of friction is enough to prevent me from getting into the flow of writing.</p>

<p>But the more interesting phenomenon is the <strong>low barrier to finishing</strong>. On Twitter, a single sentence is a completely acceptable unit of publication. Anything beyond that is sort of a bonus. In contrast, most of my blog posts go unpublished because I fear they’re not complete, or not good enough in some dimension. These unpublished drafts are obviously far more complete than a single tweet, but because they’re on a blog, they don’t feel “done,” and it’s hard to overcome the fear of sharing.</p>

<p>This seems like a crucial part of sketching tools: when you make a sketch, it should be understood that your idea is immature, and feel safe to share it in that state. <strong>There’s a time and a place for polished, deeply thorough artifacts… and it’s not Twitter!</strong> Everyone knows you just did a quick sketch.</p>

<p>I believe that quantity leads to quality. <a href="https://kottke.org/09/02/art-and-fear">The students who make more pots in ceramics class improve faster than the students who obsess over making a single perfect pot</a>. A tool with a built-in low barrier to finishing makes it easier to overcome the fear, do more work, and share it at an earlier stage.</p>



<p>In my experience, sketching always requires a delicate dance between individual thought and collaboration. You sketch to clarify something for yourself, but also to communicate with others. I think a good sketching medium should account for both halves of the process.</p>

<p>Writing a blog can feel like a lonely one-way mirror: release something into the world, maybe get a few comments back and some Hacker News snark. In contrast, <strong>Twitter is a bazaar, buzzing with activity</strong>. The engagement ratio is totally different. You can easily have micro-conversations around individual points in a thread. When the same people start showing up time after time, it starts to feel like <a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1270744181313503234">seeing acquaintances in a village</a>. On Twitter, I write for my Twitter friends, not for some amorphous crowd.</p>

<p>At its best, this engagement leads to the kind of back-and-forth that characterizes my favorite kinds of sketching sessions. Ideas are in the air, it’s not clear where they came from really, they combine to form new ones in realtime. For me, Twitter does an oddly good job at simulating the thrilling creative energy of a whiteboarding session. People pop in and out of the conversation offering insights; trees and sub-trees form riffing off of earlier points.</p>

<p>Of course, my feeling of safety here presumes healthy engagement from other parties, a privilege not enjoyed by all. I suppose it’s kind of odd that such a globally public medium is suitable at all for sketching—it seems only possible because I’ve found safe, trusting mini-communities, defined by informal and permeable boundaries. Perhaps a more private Twitter would be even better for sketching, although it might cut out new people from entering the conversation?</p>



<p>In an attempt to <em>sketch</em> more in the blog medium, I just whipped up this blog post in a couple hours, so I don’t really have a grand conclusion. And yet I’m still hitting …</p></div></div>

<p>The time may be ripe for a new Python implementation.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITksU31c1WY">lot</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDXhu4rxTNY">of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftP5BQh1-YM">keynotes</a> lately have called for one anyway. They are joined — informally, not speaking in an official capacity — by Python core developers in issuing a wakeup call: where is Python in the browser? Where is Python on mobile devices? How could Python be 2x faster?</p>
<p>Barry Warsaw at the <a href="https://youtu.be/8dDp-UHBJ_A?t=2288">PyCon 2019 Python Steering Council Panel Keynote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language is pretty awesome.
[…]
The interpreter, in a sense, is 28 years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a new Python implementation might be faster, work on different platforms, or have a smaller end deliverable.</p>
<p>It might accomplish these goals with a just-in-time or ahead-of-time compiler.</p>
<p>WebAssembly might significantly influence its implementation.</p>
<p>And critically, it might implement a different specification of Python.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wait, what? Will this still be Python?</p>
<p>If the new implementation is useful enough and has a level of compatibility with CPython that the community can deal with, (Brett Cannon said <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/213/webassembly-and-cpython">something like this on a podcast</a> a few months ago) then it might somehow be canonized.</p>
<p>This “Optimizable Python” or “Restricted Python” or “Fast Python” or “Static Python” or “Boring Python,” subset could, once agreed upon, have its semantics shadowed in CPython in an optional mode.</p>
<p>What might be up for debate? A few suggestions from <a href="https://youtu.be/KDXhu4rxTNY?t=1168">Łukasz’s talk</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>eval / exec (compiled in an environment that doesn’t allow setting regions as executable, like iOS or (perhaps? I haven’t looked) the webassembly spec.</li>
<li>the complexities and dynamism of the import system.</li>
<li>metaclasses - I don’t know what this enables, but it seems like a concession parts of the community might be willing to make</li>
<li>descriptors</li>
<li>dynamic attribute access</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So now that the Python 2 to 3 transition is wrapping up and the Python language’s governance issues have been dealt with, it’s time for some dramatic initiatives: let’s grab some stakeholders and come up with the parts of the Python spec to mark optional and get this into CPython so we can start porting code again! I propose <code>python -z</code> for zoom — there we go, ZoomPython! — because I don’t see <code>-z</code> in python or IPython command line tools. We’ll need some syntax like JavaScript’s <code>use strict</code> to mark code this way, I propose the magic string <code># this code zooms</code>. Can the committee just tell us what the new spec is already?</p>
<p>No! Or as Łukasz Langa says <a href="https://youtu.be/KDXhu4rxTNY?t=2470">in response to a a better question after his keynote</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yes, but the way you get there is to have an alternative platform that informs you what the constrained version of the language should be. If you try to predict the future of what are people are going to need, you’re likely to end up with a design that is artificial and not necessarily useful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we’re back to the hoping and waiting and wondering: where will the implementation proposal for FastPython come from?</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://youtu.be/ftP5BQh1-YM?t=2898">calls for financially support of such an effort</a> it seems that leading the prototyping of a new language implementation is not at the top of the priority list for committee. Core developers and language steering committee members seem to believe that this kind of experimental project should come from the outside. (try searching for the word Community in the transcript of <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/213/webassembly-and-cpython">the podcast Brett was on</a>) This makes sense to me.</p>
<p>PyPy is the second-most popular Python implementation. It’s “bug-compatible” with CPython, including the C extension interface, making it a viable drop-in, faster replacement for many CPython programs. It’s an incredible engineering effort, perhaps comparable in scope to the work optimizing JavaScript engines that made that language the fasted dynamically typed language in wide use. If dedicated graduate student and individual hackers, academic funding, and governments grants could make a Python so compliant and fast a Python implementation once, maybe that’s where the next implementation will come from too!</p>
<p>MicroPython is closer in design to an imagined implementation of the future: its behavior is <a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/genrst/index.html">different than CPython in a variety of cases</a> and includes <a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/speed_python.html#the-native-code-emitter">the ability to compile individual functions</a> that do not use features like context managers and generators. MicroPython was initially a Kickstarter-backed effort, then later supported by the Python Software Foundation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython">as part of its inclusion on the BBC Micro Bit</a>. The development of MicroPython provides an example of how an alternate implementation might be started by a single individual.</p>
<p>But I think the most likely place for a new implementation to come from is a large company that uses Python and has a specific need for a new interpreter. This belief comes from my time at Dropbox, where I’ve seen how projects to improve languages can happen at a company of that size: since we had so many programmers working on so much Python code, better Python tooling would be so useful a case could be made for doing it ourselves. At Dropbox this project has been the Mypy Python static type checker, but I could imagine similar projects to write language implementations. (I’m not imagining too hard; Dropbox is also supporting work on mypyc, a Python compiler I’ll discuss more in a future post.)</p>
<p>If you are employed at such a company, it’s hard for me to know how to help you make the business case, but know that it has been done before! Please consider it.</p>
<p>Where would that be? A lot of companies! Some of my favorite corporate contributions to the Python community have come from Dropbox and Instagram, but Python isn’t a niche thing anymore and there must be dozens? hundreds? of companies with idiosyncratic business interests such that a Python implementation that ran in the browser, or ran faster, or ran sandboxed, would save them millions of dollars.</p>
<hr>
<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/KDXhu4rxTNY?t=962">his inspirational keynote</a>, Łukasz phrased this as a call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where you come in. Truly tremendous impact awaits!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’ll be one the call-answerers here, but I wish these implementers the best!</p>
<p>I think I support the apparent decision for the search for the next implementation not to be centrally directed; I agree that this can come from the community, and the proof of its usefulness can too. But there is something I think we can do centrally.</p>
<p>Without pre-emptively deprecating Python language features or designating them as optional, Python can be made a more attractive implementation target by making it smaller in a another way: separating the language from standard library.</p>

<p>Have you ever consider using Machine Learning and wasn't sure about it? Would you like to know when using Machine Learning is justified? Would you like to know how to check if there is a 'signal' in your data? I've trained <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">AutoML</a> on random data an present results here to help you get a better ML understanding when to use ML and how good is your data. </p>
<p>All experiments results and code is available at <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-examples/tree/master/Random_Data">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-experiment">The experiment<a href="#the-experiment" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I've generated 3 datasets with random data. Each has 10 columns and 1k, 5k, 10k of rows. The target for each dataset is a random vector of <code>{0, 1}</code> - so a binary classification problem. I've used <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">mljar-supervised</a> AutoML python package. I run AutoML in <code>Explain</code> mode and <code>feature_selection=True</code>. The AutoML will train:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Baseline</code> (returns the most frequent class as prediction),</li>
<li><code>Decision Tree</code>,</li>
<li><code>Linear</code> model (aka Logistic Regression),</li>
<li><code>Random Forest</code>,</li>
<li><code>Xgboost</code>,</li>
<li><code>Neural Network</code>,</li>
<li><code>Ensemble</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoML will train above algorithms with default hyperparameters on <code>75%/25%</code> train/test data split. Additionally, full explanations will be produced for all models.</p>
<h2 id="the-code">The code<a href="#the-code" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code to run the experiment is simple:</p>

<p>The first <strong>red flag</strong> <img alt="🚩" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f6a9.svg" title=":triangular_flag_on_post:"> - the <code>Baseline</code> model is much better than <code>Decision Tree</code>, <code>Linear</code>, <code>Neural Network</code> and <code>Radnom Forest</code>! The constant prediction is better than complex Machine Learning algorithms. Something is wrong ...</p>
<h3 id="the-percentage-improvement">The percentage improvement<a href="#the-percentage-improvement" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>

<div><pre><span></span><code>% difference = (0.6926 - 0.6837) / 0.6926 * 100.0 = 1.28%
</code></pre></div>
<p>The best ML model is only <code>1.28%</code> better than simple baseline which predicts always the most frequent class (for example, always returns <code>1</code>). The second <strong>red flag</strong> <img alt="🚩" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f6a9.svg" title=":triangular_flag_on_post:"> - the performance improvement of best model over <code>Baseline</code> is very small.

<h3 id="learning-curves">Learning curves<a href="#learning-curves" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at learning curves of the <code>Xgboost</code> (model name <code>5_Default_Xgboost</code>):</p>

The train <code>logloss</code> is going down and test <code>logloss</code> is going in the opposite direction. The model is starting to overfit very fast (<code>5</code> trees in the <code>Xgboost</code>) - the third <strong>red flag</strong> <img alt="🚩" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f6a9.svg" title=":triangular_flag_on_post:"> (fast overfitting).</p>

<h2 id="result-for-5k-random-data">Result for 5k random data<a href="#result-for-5k-random-data" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>

<h2>An old memory resurfaces</h2>

<p>The other day I encountered the following lines of code during a review.</p>

<pre><code>if curr_page + 1 &gt;= total_pages:
   # curr_page is out of bounds, do something about it.
</code></pre>

<p>It took me a few seconds of mentally compiling and running through the code
before I could agree that it was correct. That moment of effort felt unfamiliar,
though faintly nostalgic, like hearing a song that was popular during high
school on the public address in a supermarket. And just like a one-hit wonder
from the nineties, range checks or conditionals ordered like these had vanished
from my personal landscape until this chance encounter.</p>

<p>When we first start programming, simply learning the concepts of loops and
stopping conditions is daunting enough. The skills required to optimize our code
for readability and long-term maintainability are not explicitly taught at this
point, and nor should they be, for risk of overburdening the student. A lucky
few of us might be exposed to well-crafted code, and pick up some of these
practices through copying the patterns we see. Even then, such practical
knowledge lacks the depth to convey why these patterns are useful. This means
that many programmers begin their professional life producing less-than-readable
code.</p>

<h2>Prevent Fencepost Errors with This One Weird Trick</h2>

<p>Over time, I had unconsciously learned that my code was less buggy and more
readable when I formatted my range conditionals a certain way. The right way, I
had found, was to spell them:</p>

<pre><code>start &lt;= index &lt; capacity
</code></pre>

<p>The foregoing snippet is in Python, and takes advantage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons">comparison
chaining</a>. In
Go, this may look like:</p>

<pre><code>start &lt;= index &amp;&amp; index &lt; capacity
</code></pre>

<p>The key points are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The comparands are ordered from left to right, in non-decreasing order, and</li>
<li>(for zero-based numbering): the check with the lower bound is always
less-than-equals, while the check with the upper bound is strictly-less-than.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these snippets, <code>start</code>, <code>index</code> and <code>capacity</code> are all meta-syntactic
variables, or stand-ins for the actual variable names in your own code.
Additionally, you may not need to have both sides of the range check. Your own
conditionals might look like:</p>

<pre><code>assert 0 &lt;= index # Checks that the index is at,
                  # or exceeds, the lower bound.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>for (i = 0;
    i &lt; 10;  \\ There is the high bound check.
      	     \\ We loop if the index is below it.
    i++) {
</code></pre>

<pre><code>while (pager.getCurrentPage() &lt; pager.getTotalPages()) {
</code></pre>

<pre><code>if !(start &lt;= i) {
   return nil, errors.New("i index too low.")
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The Benefits</h2>

<p>Why pay the effort of memorizing and applying a rule like this? Because, by
standardizing on this spelling, you can be more confident about the code you
write, and debug it at a glance.</p>

<p>The goal of formatting code the right way is to make mistakes look obvious.
Through repetition, you train your eyes to parse the code at a higher level than
just the individual tokens. <code>&lt;= i</code> and <code>i &lt;</code> become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_%28psychology%29">chunks</a> that you look
for, and any deviation from that pattern becomes something to be investigated
further, and/or commented upon.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the alternative. These are all valid ways, though less
readable, ways to spell <code>0 &lt;= i</code>:</p>

<pre><code>0 &lt;= i
-1 &lt; i
i + 1 &gt; 0
i &gt;= 0
!(i &lt; 0)
i &gt; -1
</code></pre>

<p>By failing to format this code in a standard way, we rob the reader of the
ability to pattern-match. Every reader then needs to parse each different
arrangment of a range check anew, both to make sense of the code, and to verify
that there are no errors. Testing the code that checks the bounds of loops is
notoriously difficult, and so we need all the help we can get in this regard.</p>

<h2>If i == done; break</h2>

<p>In conclusion,</p>

<ul>
<li>the spelling of the inequalities of your range conditionals has implications
for the readability and correctness of your code.</li>
<li>Always order your checks so that the lowest is to the left, and the largest is
to the right</li>
<li>Assuming zero-based indexing, use <code>&lt;=</code> on the low side</li>
<li>Assuming zero-based indexing, use <code>&lt;</code> on the high side</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I'll leave you with <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html">this article by E. W. Dijkstra, which makes use of these range conventions, and argues that numbering should start at 0</a>.</p>

        <blockquote><p>You want top-quality software, sure. But when is it time to increase the size of the testing team, so that you can deliver said top-quality software? Glad you asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>QA testers are part investigative reporter, part janitor—and all important to the user experience. That’s because the testers’ role is to hunt for untidy coding and to ensure that any user interaction with your software is free from error. As a result, every company worth its engineering chops knows it needs QA testers to do this crucial, sometimes dirty, work. The issue is: When do you bring on new people? How do you know it’s time to hire another QA professional?</p>
<p>In a perfect world, there would be a formula, like “hire one software tester for every five developers,” that is, runs <code>numQATesters = (numDevs+numFeatures)/(5+weWroteTests)</code>. But as life (and code) is imperfect, I came up with a few simple guidelines to justify your budget request.</p>
<p>Don’t thank me. A streamlined user experience is thanks enough.&nbsp;Particularly when it’s <em>your</em> software that I’m using.</p>
<h3>When your software is buggy</h3>
<p>Bugs are annoying yet inevitable errors that range from low priority (font change, alignment issues in text) to “Call the crisis PR team, stat!” (such as loss or exposure of data). And as we all know, a single critical flaw can result in customer dissatisfaction and a high bill from your crisis PR team. Or from the lawyers.</p>
<p>Jennifer Willy, editor of <a href="https://etia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etia.com</a>, considers bug complaints and customer issues a call to action, where the action is hiring a new QA tester. “User experience is vital. When you are faced with a situation like this, it is important to rely on good testers.” Hiring excellent testing staff both helps you <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">unravel the buggy situation</a> and also brings about a positive change in the software development process, Willy says.</p>
<p>(Of course, the lack of testers is one possible reason the software got into that sorry state. But that’s another discussion.)</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A careful QA tester who can find bugs and other errors that the development team has overlooked. A QA with the patience of a saint, specifically Saint Monica, the saint most associated with patience.</p>
<h3>When your QA team is backlogged</h3>
<p>Christian Lavender, chief product officer of vehicle refinancing platform <a href="https://www.rategenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RateGenius</a>, says that it’s time to take on a new team member when QA can’t keep up with developer output. “You can hire more engineers to get projects built faster, but if your team doesn’t have the bandwidth to test releases, they’ll just sit in the QA backlog.”</p>
<p>If your developers produce more code than you can thoroughly test in a reasonable amount of time before your QA team drowns in <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-icky-sticky-tale-of-test-case-management/">a sea of test cases</a>, it’s time to consider pinging HR. Do so sooner rather than later, because as Lavender says, “When there’s a bottleneck in QA, it ripples across the company.”</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: An octopus. During crunch time, eight hands are better than two.</p>
<h3>When your QA staff is overworked</h3>
<p>If your QA department is working overtime, on weekends, and are called in during holidays, it means they’re handling an unusually heavy load. And if you overwork your QA staff, there’s no telling if your application’s name fields will accept <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-elon-musk-pronounces-x-ae-a-12-his-new-sons-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user names like “X Æ A-12.”</a></p>
<p>“If you find that you’re spending more and more time testing than necessary, then you know it might be worth considering hiring a new QA tester,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinlma/">Colin Ma</a>, founder of Makujin Media and a former director of engineering.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A QA tester who knows how to tap out when pinned to a wrestling mat.&nbsp;A QA who would never name their child X AE A-12.</p>
<h3>When you expand your application platforms</h3>
<p>Your QA team excels at what it does, and what it does is testing desktop software. But what happens <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">when your users access your site on their cell phones</a>?</p>
<p>Your customer base should drive your next hire, says Lavender. “What devices do they use? What browser versions are they on? Are they on tablet, mobile, or desktop? Looking at all those breakdowns would drive you to the methods your QA team would use and what the specialties they would need.”</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who specializes in banking apps on iOS devices from versions 10 to 13 using Firefox versions 78 through 82, but only on Tuesdays during a full moon. Someone who <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">specializes in every other testing scenario</a>, too.</p>
<h3>When your QA team asks you to</h3>
<p>You’re in the software planning phase, and the project manager is laying out the scope of work. Joining you in the room is your QA team lead. Looking at the project, they say it straight up: “We need to hire more testers.”</p>
<p>Egor Bulyhin, project manager and team lead at consulting firm <a href="https://smart-it.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart IT</a>, says a good QA professional lets you know when work is beyond even their leet skillz. Part of a professional’s skill set is knowing their own limitations, including when they need more people to maintain a steady flow of approved features. It’s up to you to see that they get what they need (unless they need an early retirement).</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: A QA tester who isn’t afraid to tell you that you need a new hire. A QA tester who isn’t afraid to tell you that your fly is unzipped.</p>
<h3>When you need to keep your customer’s data secure</h3>
<p>Some testing specialties are less about platforms than reliability – including software security. Do you have someone qualified to find application vulnerabilities during testing?</p>
<p>When it comes to sensitive information, you need a higher level of either data or application integrity, Ma says. “One issue could be costly.” Issues include breach of trust or regulatory infractions that result in fines. If your product requires rock-solid data integrity, such as banking applications, you need a tester with relevant experience.</p>
<p>Even if you’re outside a regulatory regime, like the EU’s GDPR, you may still need to comply with it if you support EU customers. Also, have you ever read the term “data breach” in a feel-good piece? No, I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who knows what the acronym <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR</a> stands for. Someone who winces when you say “<a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/whats-really-changed-three-years-after-equifax-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equifax</a>.”</p>
<h3>When you need someone in a leadership position</h3>
<p>Let’s say your QA team has been working together for months, and each member excels at the job they’ve always done. But the work is piecemeal, with no cohesion or strategy. It’s time to hire someone with leadership abilities.</p>
<p>Jessica Salter, people operations manager of <a href="https://www.bestresponsemedia.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Response Media</a>, needed someone who could create guidelines for future best practices. In making the hire, the key attribute was finding someone in a leadership position “to help us establish a strategy and implement new ways of working.” This particular hire should have management experience, to mentor the current QA team and set them up for future success.</p>
<p><em>Recommended hire</em>: Someone who has a plan for future strategies. And might know future lottery numbers.</p>
<h3>When your business is growing</h3>
<p>Maybe your application is getting new functionality. Or perhaps you’re developing an entire new product line. Or your business is among those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/style/guitar-sales-fender-gibson.html?fbclid=IwAR39kZlhJCKPqaUmzO9Ix18hFklDs-dnN1M7-yytGPT7EPD6Z4e4drgUY7E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting a sales boost due to the pandemic</a>, which means it’s time to take on long-delayed projects.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason: On your to-hire list are several new developers. Make sure you add to this list a new QA professional, or you may experience that deadline-slaying backlog mentioned above.</p>
<p>Bulyhin likes to hire QA staff members before a new project begins, so he can onboard them before work ramps up in earnest. More importantly, he works with them to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-best-qa-job-interview-questions-for-managers-to-ask/">make sure the new QA hire</a> has the skills they need for this particular job. This way, they both can achieve their work goals.</p>
<p>Recommended hire: Someone who has been there, done that, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%2522quality+assurance%2522+t-shirts&amp;atb=v63-1&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has the t-shirts</a>. Very likely, the t-shirt reads, “A QA tester walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 3.33 beers. Orders null beers. Orders &amp;@% beers.”</p>

This isn't happening. Please use more discernment.'"</p>    <p>QAnon&nbsp;is a conspiracy theory that&nbsp;posits that&nbsp;U.S. President Donald Trump is secretly fighting an international&nbsp;cabal of Satan-worshipping, leftist elites&nbsp;who are&nbsp;running a global child sex trafficking&nbsp;ring.</p>  <p>It tends to overlap with conspiracy theories that involve anti-vaccination and anti-mask beliefs, and has roots in anti-Semitism and white supremacy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Once relegated to the fringes of the internet, QAnon has&nbsp;recently made its way into more mainstream spaces. QAnon supporter&nbsp;Marjorie Taylor Greene recently<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-primaries-greene-omar-1.5683022a"> won the Republican nomination in Georgia's primary race</a>, and the president himself has referred to the conspiracy theory's followers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/trump-qanon-conspiracy-theories.html">as people who "love our country."</a></p>    <p>But it's also started gaining&nbsp;significant traction among people who are into wellness,&nbsp;yoga, spirituality&nbsp;and alternative medicine.</p>  <p><em>Conspirituality,</em> a podcast that examines the links between wellness and conspiracy, has curated a list&nbsp;<a href="https://conspirituality.net/redpilled/">of more than two dozen wellness influencers</a> who have alluded to QAnon in their posts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corn says she started to notice it creeping into her social media feed at the start of the pandemic, with its followers&nbsp;using "yoga speak" and wellness branding to radicalize people online.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The colours might be pastel. The fonts are very specific. There's maybe one post of someone doing yoga. Then the next day it's their food. The next day, it's a lifestyle shot," she said.</p>  <p>"But on maybe the fourth day, there's going to be a post that says, you know, very prettily "COVID is a hoax" and then a bunch of slides that keep giving misinformation and invite you to another link that then gives you more misinformation."</p>  <h2>'Magical thinking'&nbsp;</h2>  <p>For Corn, the conspiracy theory's proliferation in her community is not all that surprising.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"In the wellness community, there's often a lot of magical thinking," she said.</p>  <p>For example, she says people may turn to&nbsp;crystals or prayer as a Band-Aid solution for their life's problems, without engaging with those problems on a deeper level.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think that some of the messaging in QAnon&nbsp;is appealing to magical thinking. People are afraid. Their instincts are telling them that there's something else going on, but 'I just don't know what it is. I think I'm being lied to,'" she said.</p>  <p>"Someone is coming in and saying, 'Actually, you are,' and taking them down this rabbit hole."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/qanon-in-quebec.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5727102.1600292087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/qanon-in-quebec.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Protesters hold a sign with a QAnon slogan at an anti-mask protest in Montreal. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Ali Breland,&nbsp;a reporter for Mother Jones who has been covering the overlap between QAnon and wellness, agrees.</p>  <p>He <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/funding-confusion-for-first-nations-schools-qanon-wellness-the-mulan-legend-bring-it-on-turns-20-and-more-1.5711574/qanon-has-found-a-home-among-wellness-influencers-and-new-audiences-says-reporter-1.5711585">told&nbsp;CBC Radio's<em> Day 6 </em>earlier this month</a>&nbsp;that wellness communities were already rife with anti-vaccination sentiment.</p>  <p>"[It's the idea that] these big powerful interests — these external interests that are beyond us, like Big Pharma, that we can't conceptualize, are trying to hurt our children ... and we need to protect them because no one else will," she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"That's the prevailing belief of QAnon."</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>There's a lot of women in this community who are sensitive and empathic.

And so you bring in, you know, victimized children and you're going to appeal to that part of them that wants to do something, that wants to engage," Corn said.</p>  <h2>Risks of speaking out&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Corn, with her 100,000 Instagram followers, is trying to stem the tide by sharing posts that attempt to neutralize the disinformation.</p>  <p>Others are also heeding the call. Shannon Algeo, a&nbsp;L.A. yoga and meditation teacher with 25,000 followers, is one of several influencers who shared an Instagram post&nbsp;taking&nbsp;stand against the QAnon movement.</p>  <p>"I have a community that stands behind me, or rather stands with me," Corn said.&nbsp;"I'm not alone in this effort."</p>    <p>It's the kind of stance that could, at best, cost them some of their followers and income, and at worst, invite harassment and even violence.</p>  <p>Last week, a Texas&nbsp;woman was charged with&nbsp;aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after she&nbsp;<a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/affidavit-drunk-driver-who-rammed-car-claimed-to-be-chasing-pedophile/article_5989fa98-49fb-5db1-a5f2-2cef7a42e009.html">struck two strangers with her car</a>. According to the arrest affidavits, she believed they were pedophiles. Two people who knew her <a href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/texas-qanon-car-attack-cecilia-fulbright/">told the website Right Wing Watch</a> she followed&nbsp;QAnon&nbsp;content&nbsp;online and sent them pro-QAnon&nbsp;messages.</p>  <p>Still, Corn says she has to speak out. She's already done interviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/technology/yoga-teachers-take-on-qanon.html">with the New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/qanon-wellness-influencers-seane-corn-yoga-1059856/">Rolling Stone </a>and more.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I would feel worse being silent. That would make me complicit, and I just can't live with myself in that way,"&nbsp;she said. "So, hopefully, I'll remain safe and we'll see what happens."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear. Interview produced by Chloe Shantz-Hilkes.&nbsp;</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you work with Legacy Code, things can quickly get out-of-hand.</p><p>Sometimes you dive into the code with a clear goal in mind… 3 hours later you’re still trying to break a problematic dependency and have completely lost track of why you were here in the first place!</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/assets/lost-in-field.jpg"></p><p>I recently experienced such a situation. Fortunately, I was mindful enough to apply the great advice I learned from others. It saved me a lot of time. I thought it would be a good story to share 🍷</p><h2 id="have-a-plan"><a href="#have-a-plan" aria-label="have a plan permalink"></a>Have a plan</h2><p>I’m working at <a href="https://busbud.com/">Busbud</a>. Every quarter or so, we have what we call our “Sustainability Week”.</p><p>During this week, engineers from all teams work together. We do maintenance tasks. We pay off some Technical Debt. Ideally, things that are cross-teams concerns. It’s a moment for engineers to just focus on improving their environment, while product managers discuss the next great ideas for the company.</p><p><strong>It’s great, I recommend doing something similar</strong> 👍</p><p>This week was a <em>short</em> week: the Monday was off, and I took my Wednesday off to organize <a href="https://twitter.com/nicoespeon/status/1303656226698539008">a remote conference on Legacy Code</a>. Demos were on Friday, so that gave me around 2 days to find, fix, and ship something.</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/37f584dcb85dabd5cbafe6833c5b237f/gonna-be-fine.gif" alt="It's gonna be fine!"></p><p>Hopefully, I keep track of things I want to improve as I work on our codebase every day. A good candidate at the top of my list was:</p><blockquote><p>“Clean up the DB between each test”</p></blockquote><p>We have roughly 5,200 integrated tests for this codebase. Most of them involve the database. I realized that developers had to think about cleaning up the database after tests execute, so the next ones wouldn’t be impacted by previous test data.</p><p>Cleaning up the database can be tricky because of foreign key constraints: you have to clean up the tables in a specific order. I noticed that each developer was trying to figure it out for the tests they wrote. What a waste of time!</p><p>My plan was simple: <strong>automatically clean up the database between each test</strong>. That would have 3 benefits:</p><ol><li>People wouldn’t have to think about it, faster development!</li><li>Each test would be independent, less time spent in debugging failures!</li><li>There would be only one place to maintain for cleaning up tables in the correct order.</li></ol><p>I knew that execution shouldn’t be too hard: we’re using <a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> and we can run hooks before each test.</p><p>I had a plan. It was great. I presented it and everybody was excited to see the results 🌈</p><h2 id="everybody-has-a-plan-until-they-get-punched-in-the-mouth"><a href="#everybody-has-a-plan-until-they-get-punched-in-the-mouth" aria-label="everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth permalink"></a>“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”</h2><p>On the first day, I started executing my plan. Everything went fine:</p><ul><li>I created the hook</li><li>I resolved the order in which tables should be cleaned</li><li>I tried the hooks and it worked!</li><li>I started deleting some (now useless) code from tests</li></ul><p>Then, I ran the whole test suite.</p><p><strong>Around 2,700 tests fail 💥</strong></p><p>It turns out that more than half of our tests <em>depend</em> on the data being persisted between tests. Clean up the database in between and they will start falling like dominos!</p><p><undefined>

I should start decoupling them first!</p></blockquote><p>And I actually started to do that. But I started a 1h timer for this.</p><p>After 1h, I stopped and I reflected on my progress. It turned out that cleaning up the tests wasn’t an easy task — who could have guessed…</p><p>I realized that <strong>I wouldn’t be able to achieve this in 2 days!</strong></p><p>So I stopped, reverted my work, and thought about the problem again.</p><p>Sure, getting all of these tests decoupled would be ideal. But doing that would take too much time. So much time that it wouldn’t make it up for the time it would save to developers! The fact is: we don’t touch <em>all of these tests</em> most of the time (although I don’t know which tests we’ll need to touch in the future).</p><p>At some point, we decided to use this pattern. Now, it’s costing us, slowing us down a bit every day. But recovering from that would take too much time. This refactoring would only start paying off in a few years (maybe).</p><p>Thinking about the problem again, I tried to determine if I could apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">the Pareto principle</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Roughly 80% of the benefits come from 20% of the efforts.</p></blockquote><p>Time’s wasted today because:</p><ol><li>Developers have to think about cleaning up the database themselves</li><li>Developers have to figure out how to clean up their data</li></ol><p>In fact, providing a helper function to simply “clean up the database” would solve a good part of the problem!</p><p>Sure, developers will still have to think about cleaning up the DB themselves. But doing so would be easy. Also, there would be only one function to maintain if the database structure ever changes.</p><h2 id="happy-ending"><a href="#happy-ending" aria-label="happy ending permalink"></a>Happy ending</h2><p>I was able to ship this change before the deadline and even tackle other topics in the remaining time. The end result wasn’t the one I announced, but I explained my findings and the decisions I had taken. I also <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/earn-maintainers-esteem-with-adrs">documented all that in an ADR</a>, so we can easily revisit this decision in the future.</p><p>Was it wasted time? I think not:</p><ul><li>I shipped something that will save time to developers nevertheless</li><li>I learned something along the way</li><li>I documented that learning somewhere reliable, so we can change our mind later</li><li>I moved to other refactoring opportunities</li></ul><p>I think that was a good week, and I wish to have more wins like this 💪</p><h2 id="lessons-to-be-learned"><a href="#lessons-to-be-learned" aria-label="lessons to be learned permalink"></a>Lessons to be learned</h2><p>To be honest, this could have easily turned into a nightmare if it wasn’t for the good habits I developed over time.</p><p>Here’s my recap’ of the things that helped me win the day when the odds were against me. They can help you too:</p><ol><li><strong>Have a clear goal in mind before starting refactoring</strong>. I like using <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase">the Mikado Method</a> for that. Or simply dropping my thoughts on a piece of paper, to keep track of what I’m doing.</li><li><strong>Timebox yourself</strong>. Especially when you’re not familiar with what you’re about to do. Decide to go for one hour. Then stop, go have a drink, and think about your problem again. Are you heading in a good direction? What if you retried? Would you have a better way?</li><li><strong>Don’t be afraid to throw away what you did and start over</strong>. Timebox helps with that!</li><li><strong>Do the best you can in the allocated time</strong>. Be mindful of your deadline.</li><li><strong>Communicate with your team</strong>. Share your findings. Document your decisions.</li><li><strong>Know when to stop</strong>. Especially if you’ve already invested long hours. This is when you need to take a step back and think again. Can you bring 80% of the value in time, even if it’s not perfect?</li><li><strong>Some refactorings don’t worth it</strong>. Legacy Code isn’t perfect and that’s fine. The game is about making it better, even if it’s just a little bit.</li></ol><p>Being able to work with Legacy Code when you have a short deadline isn’t easy, it takes practice. That’s why I’m crafting a kit that would guide you to refactor your Legacy codebase in no time.</p><p><strong>Interested?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>I'm not sure people realize what a boon the Apple Watch's oximeter (blood oxygen app) may be to one's tracking of personal health, so I thought I'd provide some example data to provide a feel for what you'll be able to monitor. Of course, a lot will depend on what people discover about the watch's oxygen monitoring: Accuracy, the granularity of data, etc. But I think it's going to be a great help for people who want to understand better the relationship between blood oxygen levels and heart health. Additionally, some people use oximeters to measure their oxygen out of concern for hypoxia that is induced by the novel coronavirus.</p> <p>The TL;DR on this is that with oximeter readings and metrics for heart rate variability, you can get some insights into possible sleep apnea that can increase heart rate variability and potentially cause atrial fibrillation (which can in turn provoke stroke or heart failure).</p> <p>All graphs and charts are shared with the permission of the person who originated the data.</p> <p>So the first image shows the overnight blood oxygen this person has on a typical night using a CPAP machine. This looks good. All SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) values are above 90%. The person's pulse is low. <a href="https://7fff.com/2020/09/does-the-apple-watch-6-oximeter-matter/(https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulse-oximetry-test)">WebMD</a> says: "A blood oxygen level lower than 89% means you may not have enough oxygen in your blood to meet your body's needs. This could be because there’s a problem with your heart or lungs." These values were collected with a <a href="https://getwellue.com/pages/o2ring-oxygen-monitor">Wellue O2Ring</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://7fff.com/assets/images/pulseox1-6d1be445.jpg" title="Normal pulse ox readings" alt="pulseox1" width="750" height="1334"></p> <p>Now, one way you might be starving your brain and body for oxygen is if you have sleep apnea. This person uses a CPAP device every night, but recently when traveling did not have the CPAP. Here's what can go wrong.</p> <p><img src="https://7fff.com/assets/images/pulseox2-d625e53c.jpg" title="pulse ox readings slowing sleep apnea" alt="pulseox2" width="750" height="1334"></p> <p>As you can see in the second image, during sleep apnea, one's blood oxygen level can spike way down.</p> <p>Prolonged episodes of sleep apnea can cause a lot of problems. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">Mayo Clinic</a> says: "Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. Having obstructive sleep apnea increases your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). Obstructive sleep apnea might also increase your risk of recurrent heart attack, stroke and abnormal heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. If you have heart disease, multiple episodes of low blood oxygen (hypoxia or hypoxemia) can lead to sudden death from an irregular heartbeat."</p> <p>I'm not a doctor, but there are articles (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306298/">example</a>) suggesting that prolonged sleep apnea with its impact on blood oxygen can affect heart rate variability (HRV), which would seem to be a leading indicator for issues such as atrial fibrillation (afib) which is a form of cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to a stroke or heart failure. The Apple Watch can track this. Here are three examples of HRV readings from the Apple Health app. The first one shows relatively normal HRV for this person; the second shows elevate readings; and then the third image shows HRV leading up to the onset of afib.</p> <p>Once this person started using a CPAP, the HRV settled down, and the heart reverted from afib to normal "sinus" rhythm.</p> <p>In short, had this person known his or her oxygen levels, there might have been an earlier conversation with a physician leading to some controls (such as better diet, reduced caffiene and alcohol consumption, more exercise, the use of a CPAP machine . . .) that might have reduced the likelihood of afib occurring.</p> <p><img src="https://7fff.com/assets/images/hrv1-916829e7.png" title="normal heart rate variability for this person" alt="hrv1" width="742" height="830"></p> <p><img src="https://7fff.com/assets/images/hrv2-017b02c9.png" title="increased heart rate variability for this person" alt="hrv2" width="742" height="833"></p> <p><img src="https://7fff.com/assets/images/hrv3-eaa53feb.png" title="heart rate variability leading up to afib" alt="hrv3" width="745" height="832"></p>    <p><a href="http://disqus.com/">comments powered by </a>  </p></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s become less common to hear people referred to as “resources” in recent times. There’s more trendy <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f89ce89e-3450-417e-a8de-5783353e3d85">“official vocab guidelines”</a>, but what’s really changed? There’s still phrases in common use that sound good but betray the same mindset.</p>



<p>I often hear people striving to <em>“</em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22hire%22+and+%22retain%22+%22best+talent%22"><em>hire and retain the best talent</em></a><em>“</em> as if that is a strategy for success, or as if talent is a limited resource we must <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_for_talent">fight over.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another common one is to describe employees as your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22employees%22+%22asset%22"><em>“greatest asset”</em></a>.</p>



<p>I’d like to believe both phrases come from the good intentions of valuing people. Valuing individuals as per the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>. I think these phrases betray a lack of consideration of the <em>“…and&nbsp; interactions”</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implication is organisations are in a battle to win and then protect as big a chunk as they can of a finite resource called <em>“talent”</em>. It’s positioned as a zero-sum game. There’s an implication that the impact of an organisation is a pure function of the <em>“talent”</em> it has accumulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are not Talent. An organisation can amplify or stifle the brilliance of people.&nbsp;It can grow skills or curtail talent.</p>



<p>Talent is not skill. Talent gets you so far but skills can be grown. Does the team take the output that the people in it have the skill to produce? Or does the team provide an environment in which everyone can increase their skills and get more done than they could alone?&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://deming.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/a-bad-system-will-10091-2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>We might hire the people with the most pre-existing talent, and achieve nothing if we stifle them with a bureaucracy that prevents them from getting anything done. Organizational <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/dont-scar-on-the-first-cut/">scar tissue</a> that gets in the way; policies that demotivate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even without the weight of bureaucracy many teams are really just collections of individuals with a common manager. The outcomes of such groups <em>are</em> limited by the talent and preexisting skill of the people in them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrast this with a team into which you can hire brilliant people who’ve <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2020/09/06/reasons-to-hire-inexperienced-engineers/">yet to have the opportunity</a> of being part of a team that grows them into highly skilled individuals. A team that gives everyone space to learn, provides challenges to stretch everyone, provides an environment where it’s safe to fail. Teams that have practices and habits that enable them to achieve great things <em>despite</em> the fallibility and limitations of the talent of each of the people in the team.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“when you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you find sometimes that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it.”</em>—AA Milne&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>While I’m a bear of very little brain, I’ve had the opportunity to be part of great teams that have taught me habits that help me achieve more than I can alone. </p>



<p>Habits like giving and receiving feedback. Like working <em><a href="https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/inclusive-benefits-of-mob-programming/">together</a></em> to balance each others weaknesses and learn from each other faster. Like making predictions and observing the results. Like investing in keeping <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">things simple</a> so they can fit into my brain. Like working in <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2020/02/12/do-you-ci/">small steps</a>. Like scheduled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=tImsExfrTPA">reflection points</a> to consider how to improve <a href="https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Agile_Retrospective_Resource_Wiki"><em>how</em> we’re working</a>. Like occasionally <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2018/03/17/hack-days-removing-the-rules/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2018/03/17/hack-days-removing-the-rules/">throwing away the rules</a> and seeing what happens.</p>



<p>Habits like <a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/tdd/geekery-pro-tip-think-less-sense-more/">thinking less and sensing more.&nbsp;</a></p>

September 21, 2020 | https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I read a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">Why Not Rust?</a> article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: <strong>security</strong>. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and security, yet I still have some pain points that will make me recommend <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> over Rust sometimes. Keep in mind that I have also spent my whole career looking for bugs in applications written in dozens of different languages, so my post might be highly controversial but it has to be looked from these lenses.</p>
<h2>Shallow standard library</h2>
<p>Working with Rust is like working with Javascript in many ways. While the package manager Cargo is truly awesome, the fact that the standard library misses most features will have you import many third-party dependencies. These dependencies in turn import other third-party dependencies, that import other third-party dependencies, and so on. This blow up of dependencies can quickly become a nightmare, and this is of course a perfect vector of attack for backdoors, like we've seen happen before in javascript land (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor">https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor</a>/, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds</a>/).</p>
<p>Not only this, but if you're a newcomer to Rust, how do you even pick the right library? I can't even fathom how anyone writing a project in Rust gets to pick a good library for generating cryptographic random numbers, or for doing any type of crypto like encrypting or hashing, or for decoding hex strings, or for decoding JSON, or for using TCP, or even for using TLS! On the other hand Golang has all of that in its standard library, that means that when you use Golang you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can't pick the wrong algorithm (e.g. DES instead of AES)</li>
<li>can't pick a bad implementation (the standard library is known to be high quality) </li>
<li>can't pick a dependency that ends up importing plenty of other third-party dependencies (unlike Rust, the Golang standard library never imports third-party libraries)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about version updates (you're just updating your version of Golang instead of the versions of many dependencies)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about transitive dependencies that you can't update (again, Golang standard library doesn't rely on third-party dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://libra.org/">Libra</a> we've used a number of techniques in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies we use. This included figuring out when we used different dependencies that did the same thing, or figuring out what obscure dependencies we should avoid, we even re-wrote a large number of dependencies to avoid dependencies that ended up exploding the number of transitive third-party dependencies we imported. One useful tool we used for some of that is <a href="https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell">dephell</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy">guppy</a>.</p>
<h2>Rustfmt is imperfect</h2>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is great, but <code>rustfmt</code> sucks. Why does it suck? Two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not mandatory</li>
<li>it's configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Golang's compiler is very strict and will yell at you early on if you have dead code, unused dependencies, badly formatted code, and so on. It doesn't replace <code>gofmt</code>, but it's much more opinionated and is much more effective at making Golang's codebases more readable (especially if they forget to run <code>gofmt</code>). In addition, if you do use <code>gofmt</code>, you can't configure it! This is very apparent when you read Golang code, it always looks the same! And it is pretty fucking fantastic if you ask me, because not only Golang is easy to learn, but you can quickly get used to any Golang codebase due to the consistent formatting of the language.</p>
<h2>Too many ways to do things</h2>
<p>Rust has a somewhat different syntax from other languages of its genre, and you sometimes see things that you might not be used to see (statement as expression, match statements, lifetimes, etc.) I couldn't care less about these, these are things you can learn, and you end up getting used to them. What I can't get used to is the sheer number of ways to do something. There are so many keywords in Rust, and there's so many ways to end up bike shedding on the best way to write the exact same statement, that I consider it a waste of time. It's a waste of time for the developers, but also for the reviewers who will often run into keywords that they've never seen before. For example, there are too many ways to panic on purpose: <code>panic!()</code>, <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>except()</code>, <code>unreachable!()</code>, <code>todo!()</code>, <code>unimplemented!()</code>, <code>assert!()</code>, and so on. </p>
<h2>Generics and macros</h2>
<p>Rust is too expressive. This is of course great for some use-cases, but holy shit if a developer wants to be too clever, they can create the most unintelligible codebase that you'll ever seen. This is probably the most controversial point, but security is not just safety, it's also readability. As we say "complexity is the enemy of security", and generics undeniably add complexity. This is of course up to the developers to abuse them, but the great thing about Golang is that there aren't many things to abuse, codebases are often straight forward and you can quickly understand what is happening.</p>
<h2>Ok, you're being unreasonable David</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm omitting a lot of good Rust things in here, but this is a post about the security downsides of Rust, not the upsides, which let's be clear still make Rust the perfect language to write a sensitive application in. You just need to know what you're doing. This also means that Rust has a lot of room to mature, while generics are here to stay, there is no excuse to keep slipping the shallow stdlib under the rug.</p>

    </span></p><p>Financial gurus talk about having multiple streams of income. The idea is to have income from several sources, rather than relying on a single one. We ought to embody a similar principle when learning programming topics and building programming skills.</p><p>My recommendation is to apply an approach that I like to call “multiple streams of learning,” or MSL. It means to actively study a field or build a skill from multiple perspectives.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>This is in contrast to the more common approach to learning, which I think of as a “siloed” approach to learning. It’s when you focus exclusively on a single form of learning, say a course or project, for example, and only that course or project.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>MSL may seem obvious. But few people follow it. More often than not, people take the siloed approach to learning. They zero in on a single form of learning and let everything else fall to the wayside.</p><p>Some examples of familiar excuses include:</p><ul><li>Get feedback? There’s no time for it.</li><li>Read technical books? Maybe sometime in the future.</li><li>Meet with peers to discuss programming topics and ask questions? Perhaps in an ideal world.</li><li>Read and study the code of others who’ve solved the same problem, and apply what you learn? Not now.</li></ul><p>In this blog post I argue that MSL is the approach to use when it comes to learning and skill-building.</p><p>A programmer I know is learning computer science. He’s enrolled in an online curriculum, which includes the standard lectures and assignments.</p><p>For most people, the learning would stop there. They’d focus entirely on the course, and only the course. They unconsciously opt for the siloed approach to learning.</p><p>Not this programmer. His coursework is one avenue for learning computer science—but definitely not the only one.</p><p>He spends a significant amount of time working on other related projects and problems. He and two classmates meet virtually once per week to talk about computer science topics and ask questions. He also meets virtually with a classmate to work through problems and get feedback. And, until recently, he led a reading group that discussed and analyzed technical books.</p><p>This programmer exemplifies MSL. He’s actively attacking computer science from multiple angles. This helps to foster connections, solidify concepts, and increase the learning rate.</p><p>So he’s learning the material, to be sure. But there’s something more.</p><p>He’s also seeing the field of computer science from many perspectives—the instructors, classmates, authors of technical books, and peers—instead of a single one. This plurality of viewpoints not only helps foster an open mind. But it also helps you pick up on the details: what’s overlooked or confusing in one context is made concrete in another.</p><p>This is MSL in action.</p><p>The idea of MSL was born out of necessity during my mid-twenties, when I decided to go to graduate school to study art history.</p><p>There was a challenge, however. I had no industry experience in the arts and, other than a few classes in college, I had very little knowledge of the field. I had a lot of work to do just to get <em>into</em> graduate school.</p><p>To get up to speed, I took some classes. But a significant part of my education took place <em>outside</em> of the classroom where I was actively engaged in the art world.</p><p>I became a docent at the local museum, where I gave tours about the museum’s art collection and current exhibitions; experienced art in the flesh (which is far better than seeing it on a slide projected on a flat wall); and learned the ins and outs of museum life.</p><p>I also became a research assistant for an art history professor. This experience helped to sharpen my researching and writing skills, and gave me an academic’s perspective of the art world. Then, there was the art history reading group, where about ten of my classmates (from the university where I took supplemental classes) engaged in intense conversations on dense theoretical texts.</p><p>Art was constantly on my mind in many different ways. As a result, my knowledge soared.</p><p>Of course, at the time, I didn’t have a name for my learning approach. I was just trying to learn as much as possible, and actively engaging in a variety of pursuits from multiple angles seemed like a way to do it.</p><p>So I continued this approach once I was enrolled in graduate school. This time I decided to launch a blog about the arts.</p><p>I took it as an opportunity to interview gallerists, curators, and artists, who were more than willing to talk and answer my questions. I attended art exhibitions by the dozens, and traveled to art studios. Then, I’d come back to my apartment and write a blog post.</p><p>Once again, my knowledge soared. This is how I learned about curating an art show and how artists work and think. It’s also how I got my start as a writer.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and I began another self-study pursuit: learning to program. You may think I began my journey with MSL.</p><p>But that’s not what happened.</p><p>I can’t explain <em>why</em> I didn’t begin learning to program with the approach that served me well in learning the art field. It simply escapes me.</p><p>Instead, I began my self-taught programming journey with the siloed approach to learning. It didn’t work.</p><p>Three months in, I did a complete reboot and restarted my programming journey from scratch. That’s because my first attempt was not effective, due to poor learning techniques and an inadequate learning strategy.</p><p>During round two of learning to program, I took time to learn how to learn, that way I had the strategies at hand to learn technical topics better. I also developed an overall learning strategy that involved MSL.</p><h2>How to Make it a Reality</h2><p>You can apply MSL to a particular field, like the programmer who’s learning computer science. You can also apply it to a concept or technology you’re trying to learn, or skill you’re trying to build.</p><p>Either way, the idea is the same: identify what you want to learn or get better at. Then, actively attack it from multiple angles.</p><p>When I first began to program, I followed the oft-cited advice for getting better at problem-solving: solve lots of problems. So I took the siloed approach toward problem-solving and only focused on solving as many problems as possible.</p><p>But repetition is only part of the story, as I came to find out. Repetition alone won’t get you there. You’ve got to be <em>intentional</em> about your practice, which I explain in my article about <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/how-to-get-better-at-solving-programming-problems">how to get better at problem-solving</a>.</p><p>Now my problem-solving approach is multifaceted.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Undoubtedly, solving problems is essential in order to get better at problem-solving. You’ve got to do the thing you want to get better at.</p><p>But we can’t discount other forms of knowledge that can accelerate your learning, like getting feedback and studying the code of others who've solved the same problem.</p><p>MSL forces you to apply your knowledge in different ways. Solving a problem in Python and then JavaScript forces me to think differently—even if it’s the same problem. It’s a reason why I’m a huge advocate for solving math problems as well.</p><p>The challenge becomes making what are typically conceived of as passive forms of knowledge active.</p><h2>Make It Active</h2><p>A cornerstone of MSL is to make the streams of learning active, and for good reason: you’ll remember it better.</p><p>Take feedback, for example. I aim to get feedback in real-time (which can easily be done via video conferencing in today’s remote-working world), instead of relying on written comments from a pull request. This makes the process active.</p><p>Reading through comments is passive, whereas real-time conversations force you to be mentally engaged by thinking on the fly, asking follow-up questions, and responding to the information at hand.</p><p>Then, put what you learn into action.</p><p>I once got feedback from a programmer who said I needed to <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/improve-your-code-by-writing-better-variable-names.mdx">write better variable names</a>. So I read about them in the book <em>Code Complete</em>, and made a “variable name” checklist. It hangs on the wall in front of my desk. Now there’s no excuse: writing variable names is constantly on my mind.</p><p>Or consider reading technical books. At first blush, this also sounds like a passive activity.</p><p>But there are ways to make it active. For one, “<a href="https://amymhaddad.com/four-ways-to-learn-programming-topics">spot check</a>” your learning: after you read a short section, stop and summarize to yourself what you just learned.</p><p>Another is to focus on one topic that you read about and apply it in your daily work. I type notes in Evernote for each technical book I read. To get better at writing tests, for example, I pull up my notes about test-driven development so I’m reminded to put my knowledge into action.</p><p>MSL is not a hack. It’s not a quick fix. Learning and building skills still take time and a lot of work.</p><p>But given my experience with both the siloed approach to learning and MSL, I can tell you first-hand that the latter is far superior of the two.</p><p>This is not only because MSL is more effective. But the variety also makes the learning process more enjoyable. And there’s something to be said for that. After all, learning to program isn’t a one-time thing. It’s a <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/learning-to-program-is-a-lifelong-pursuit">lifetime pursuit</a>. Enjoy the journey.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Real developers use the CLI, or so I’m told. That probably explains why I mostly use the portal experiences of the major cloud providers. But judging from the portal experiences offered by most clouds, they prefer you use the CLI too. <strong>So let’s look at the CLIs.</strong></p>



<p>Specifically, I evaluated the cloud CLIs with an eye on five different areas:</p>



<ol><li><strong>API surface and patterns.</strong> How much of the cloud was exposed via CLI, and is there a consistent way to interact with each service?</li><li><strong>Authentication.</strong> How do users identify themselves to the CLI, and can you maintain different user profiles?</li><li><strong>Creating and viewing services.</strong> What does it feel like to provision instances, and then browse those provisioned instances?</li><li><strong>CLI sweeteners.</strong> Are there things the CLI offers to make using it more delightful?</li><li><strong>Utilities. </strong>Does the CLI offer additional tooling that helps developers build or test their software?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s dig in.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>You have a few ways to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">install the AWS CLI</a>. You can use a Docker image, or install directly on your machine. If you’re installing directly, you can download from AWS, or use your favorite package manager. AWS warns you that third party repos may not be up to date. I went ahead and installed the CLI on my Mac using <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli#default">Homebrew</a>.</p>



<h3>API surface and patterns</h3>



<p>As you’d expect, the AWS CLI has <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/index.html">wide coverage</a>. Really wide. I think there’s an API in there to retrieve the name of Andy Jassy’s favorite jungle cat. The <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/index.html">EC2 commands</a> alone could fill a book. The documentation is comprehensive, with detailed summaries of parameters, and example invocations.</p>



<p>The command patterns are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-commandstructure.html">relatively consistent</a>, with some disparities between older services and newer ones. Most service commands look like:</p>



<pre>aws [service name] [action] [parameters]</pre>



<p>Most “actions” start with create, delete, describe, get, list, or update.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>aws elasticache create-cache-cluster --engine redis
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name seroter-stream
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name seroter-stream
aws qldb delete-ledger --name seroterledger
aws sqs list-queues</pre>



<p>S3 is one of the original AWS services, and <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html">its API is different</a>. It uses commands like <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>rm</code>. Some services have <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/elasticache/index.html">modify</a> commands, others use <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/eks/index.html">update</a>. For the most part, it’s intuitive, but I’d imagine most people can’t guess the commands.</p>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p>There isn’t one way to authenticate to the AWS CLI. You might <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html">use SSO</a>, an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html">external file</a>, or inline <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">access key and ID</a>, like I do below.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8394" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-01/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png" data-orig-size="600,166" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-01.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The CLI supports “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-profiles">profiles</a>” which seems important when you may have different access to default values based on what you’re working on.</p>



<h3>Creating and viewing service instances</h3>



<p>By default, everything the CLI does occurs in the region of the active profile. You can override the default region by passing in a region flag to each command. See below that I created a new SQS queue without providing a region, and it dropped it into my default one (us-west-2). By explicitly passing in a target region, I created the second queue elsewhere.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8397" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-02/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png" data-orig-size="600,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-02.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The AWS Console shows you resources for a selected region. I don’t see obvious ways to get an all-up view. A few services, like S3, aren’t bound by region, and you see all resources at once. The CLI behaves the same. I can’t view all my SQS queues, or databases, or whatever, from around the world. I can “list” the items, region by region. Deletion behaves the same. I can’t delete the above SQS queue without providing a region flag, even though the URL is region-specific. </p>



<p>Overall, it’s fast and straightforward to provision, update, and list AWS services using the CLI. Just keep the region-by-region perspective in mind!</p>



<h3>CLI sweeteners</h3>



<p>The AWS CLI gives you control over the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.html">output format</a>. I set the default for my profile to json, but you can also do yaml, text, and table. You can toggle this on a request by request basis.</p>



<p>You can also take advantage of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html">command completion</a>. This is handy, given how tricky it may be to guess the exact syntax of a command. Similarly, I really like you can be <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html">prompted for parameters</a>. Instead of guessing, or creating giant strings, you can go parameter by parameter in a guided manner.</p>



<p>The AWS CLI also offers select opportunities to interact with the resources themselves. I can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sqs/send-message.html">send and receive</a> SQS messages. Or <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/dynamodb/put-item.html">put an item</a> directly into a DynamoDB table. There are a handful of services that let you create/update/delete data in the resource, but many are focused solely on the lifecycle of the resource itself.</p>



<p>Finally, I don’t see a way to self-update from within the CLI itself. It looks like you rely on your package manager or re-download to refresh it. If I’m wrong, tell me!</p>



<h3>Utilities</h3>



<p>It doesn’t look like the CLI ships with other tools that developers might use to build apps for AWS.</p>







<p>The Microsoft Azure CLI also has broad coverage and is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest">well documented</a>. There’s no shortage of examples, and it clearly explains how to use each command.</p>



<p>Like AWS, Microsoft offers their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker?view=azure-cli-latest">CLI in a Docker image</a>. They also offer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">direct downloads</a>, or access via a package manager. I grabbed mine from <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli#default">Homebrew</a>.</p>



<h3>API surface and patterns</h3>



<p>The CLI supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">almost every major Azure service.</a> Some, like Logic Apps or Blockchain, only show up in their experimental sandbox. </p>



<p>Commands follow a particular syntax:</p>



<pre>az [service name] [object] create | list | delete | update [parameters]</pre>



<p>Let’s look at a few examples:</p>



<pre>az ad app create --display-name my-ad-app
az cosmosdb list --resource-group group1
az postgres db show --name mydb --resource-group group1 --server-name myserver
az service bus queue delete --name myqueue --namespace-name mynamespace --resource-group group1</pre>



<p>I haven’t observed much inconsistency in the CLI commands. They all seem to follow the same basic patterns.</p>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_login">Logging into the CLI </a>is easy. You can simply do <code>az login</code> as I did below—this opens a browser window and has you sign into your Azure account to retrieve a token—or you can pass in credentials. Those credentials may be a username/password, service principal with a secret, or service principal with a client certificate.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="8399" data-permalink="https://seroter.com/2020-09-15-cli-03/" data-orig-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png" data-orig-size="600,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2020.09.15-cli-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=600" src="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=600" alt="" srcset="https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png 600w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=150 150w, https://seroter.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/2020.09.15-cli-03.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>Once you log in, you see all your Azure subscriptions. You can parse the JSON to see which one is active, and will be used as the default. If you wish to change the default, you can use <code>az account set --subscription [name]</code> to pick a different one. </p>



<p>There doesn’t appear to be a way to create different local profiles.</p>



<h3>Creating and viewing service instances</h3>



<p>It seems that most everything you create in Azure goes into a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview">resource group</a>. While a resource group has a “location” property, that’s related to the metadata, not a restriction on what gets deployed into it. You can set a default resource group (<code>az configure --defaults group=[name]</code>) or provide the relevant input parameter on each request.</p>



<p>Unlike other clouds, <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/aws-azure-gcp-resource-hierarchies-25b829127511">Azure has a lot of nesting</a>. You have a root account, then a subscription, and then a resource group. And most resources also have parent-child relationships you must define before you can actually build the thing you want. </p>



<p>For example, if you want a service bus queue, you first create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/servicebus/namespace?view=azure-cli-latest">namespace</a>. You can’t create both at the same time. It’s two calls. Want a storage blob to upload videos into? Create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest">storage account</a> first. A web application to run your .NET app? Provision a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/appservice/plan?view=azure-cli-latest">plan</a>. Serverless function? Create a plan. This doesn’t apply to everything, but just be aware that there are often multiple steps involved.</p>



<p>The creation activity itself is fairly simple. Here are commands to create Service Bus namespace and then a queue</p>



<pre>az servicebus namespace create --resource-group mydemos --name seroter-demos --location westus
az servicebus queue create --resource-group mydemos --namespace-name seroter-demos --name myqueue</pre>



<p>Like with AWS, some Azure assets get grouped by region. With Service Bus, namespaces are associated to a geo. I don’t see a way to query all queues, regardless of region. But for the many that aren’t, you get a view of all resources across the globe. After I created a couple Redis caches in my resource group, a simple <code>az redis list --resource-group mydemos</code> showed me caches in two different parts of the US.</p>



<p>Depending on how you use resource groups—maybe per app or per project, or even by team—just be aware that the CLI doesn’t retrieve results across resource groups. I’m not sure the best strategy for viewing subscription-wide resources other than the Azure Portal.</p>



<h3>CLI sweeteners</h3>



<p>The Azure CLI has some handy things to make it easier to use. </p>



<p>There’s a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_find">find function</a> for figuring out commands. There’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">output formatting</a> to json, tables, or yaml. You’ll also find a useful <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/interactive-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">interactive mode</a> to get auto-completion, command examples, and more. Finally, I like that the Azure CLI supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_upgrade">self-upgrade</a>. Why leave the CLI if you don’t have to?</p>



<h3>Utilities</h3>



<p>I noticed a few things in this CLI that help developers. First, there’s an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az_rest">az rest</a> command that lets you call Azure service endpoints with authentication headers taken care of for you. That’s a useful tool for calling secured endpoints.</p>



<p>Azure offers a wide array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview?view=azure-cli-latest">extensions</a> to the CLI. These aren’t shipped as part of the CLI itself, but you can easily bolt them on. And you can create your own. This is a fluid list, but <code>az extension list-available</code> shows you what’s in the pool right now. As of this writing, there are extensions for preview AKS capabilities, managing Azure DevOps, working with DataBricks, using Azure LogicApps, querying the Azure Resource Graph, and more.</p>







<p>I’ve only recently started seriously using the GCP CLI. What’s struck me most about the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">gcloud</a> tool is that it feels more like a system—dare I say, …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Postgres 13 is almost here. It's been in beta since May, and the general availability release is
coming any day. We've been following Postgres 13 closely here at pganalyze, and have been running
the beta in one of our staging environments for several months now.</p>
<p>There are no big new features in Postgres 13, but there are a lot of small but important incremental
improvements. Let's take a look.</p>

<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="performance permalink"></a>Performance</h2>
<p>Postgres 13 performance improvements include both built-in optimizations and heuristics that will make
your database run better out of the box, as well as additional features to give you more flexibility
in optimizing your schema and queries.</p>

<p>Postgres 13 introduces a way for B-Tree indexes to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION">avoid storing duplicate entries in some situations</a>.
In general, a B-Tree index consists of a tree of indexed values, with each leaf node pointing to a
particular row version. Because each leaf points to one row version, if you are indexing non-unique
values, those values need to be repeated.</p>
<p>The de-duplication mechanism avoids that by having a leaf node point to several row versions if possible,
which leads to smaller indexes.</p>
<p>Here is an example from our own pganalyze application schema: We have a <code>queries</code> table to
track all the queries we monitor, and a <code>database_id</code> field to track which database they belong to. We
index <code>database_id</code> (so we can quickly fetch queries for a specific database), and because each database
typically has more than one query, there is a lot of duplication in this index.</p>
<p>New B-Tree indexes in Postgres 13 use the deduplication feature by default, but if for some reason,
you need to turn it off, you can control it with the <code>deduplicate_items</code> storage parameter. Here we
create the same index in two different ways, with deduplication explicitly on and off (though again,
you don't need to specify <code>on</code>—this is the default):</p>

<p>With deduplication, the new index is more than <strong>three times smaller</strong>! Smaller indexes are faster to load
from disk, and take up less space in memory, meaning there's more room for your data.</p>
<p>One interesting note here is that the index entries point to row <em>versions</em> (as in, a row the way it
exists in one specific <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/mvcc.html">MVCC</a> state), not rows themselves,
so this feature <strong>can improve index size even for unique indexes</strong>, where one would not expect any duplication
to occur.</p>
<p>Note that deduplication is not possible in all cases (see above link for details), and that you
will need to reindex before you can take advantage of it if upgrading via <code>pg_upgrade</code>.</p>
<h3 id="extended-statistics-improvements-in-postgres-13"><a href="#extended-statistics-improvements-in-postgres-13" aria-label="extended statistics improvements in postgres 13 permalink"></a>Extended Statistics Improvements in Postgres 13</h3>
<p>Postgres 10 introduced the concept of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/planner-stats.html#PLANNER-STATS-EXTENDED">extended statistics</a>. Postgres keeps some statistics about the "shape" of your data to ensure it can plan queries efficiently,
but the statistics kept by default cannot track things like inter-column dependencies. Extended statistics
were introduced to address that: These are database objects (like indexes) that you create manually with
<code>CREATE STATISTICS</code> to give the query planner more information for more specific situations. These would be
expensive for Postgres to determine automatically, but armed with an understanding of the semantics of your
schema, you can provide that additional info. Used carefully, this can lead to
<a href="https://build.affinity.co/how-we-used-postgres-extended-statistics-to-achieve-a-3000x-speedup-ea93d3dcdc61">massive performance improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Postgres 13 brings a number of small but important improvements to extended statistics, including
support for using them with <code>OR</code> clauses and in <code>IN</code>/<code>ANY</code> constant lists, allowing consideration
of multiple extended statistics objects in planning a query, and support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-alterstatistics.html">setting a statistics target</a> for
extended statistics:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>STATISTICS</span> table_stx <span>SET</span> <span>STATISTICS</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Like with the regular statistics target, this is a trade-off between additional planning time (and longer <code>ANALYZE</code> runs), versus having more precise plans. We recommend using this in a targeted manner using EXPLAIN plans to confirm plan changes.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-vacuum--better-support-for-append-only-workloads"><a href="#parallel-vacuum--better-support-for-append-only-workloads" aria-label="parallel vacuum  better support for append only workloads permalink"></a>Parallel VACUUM &amp; Better Support for Append-only Workloads</h3>
<p>Postgres multi-version concurrency control means you need to run <code>VACUUM</code> regularly (usually you can rely
on the autovacuum process, though it may need some tuning). In Postgres 13, one notable improvement is
that multiple indexes for a single table can be vacuumed in parallel. This can lead to big performance
improvements in <code>VACUUM</code> work. Parallel <code>VACUUM</code> is the default and can be controlled with the <code>PARALLEL</code> option:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>VACUUM <span>(</span>PARALLEL <span>2</span><span>,</span> VERBOSE<span>)</span> queries<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>INFO:  vacuuming "public.queries"
INFO:  launched 2 parallel vacuum workers for index vacuuming (planned: 2)
INFO:  scanned index "index_queries_on_database_id" to remove 1403418 row versions by parallel vacuum worker
DETAIL:  CPU: user: 0.98 s, system: 0.15 s, elapsed: 2.37 s
INFO:  scanned index "index_queries_on_last_occurred_at" to remove 1403418 row versions by parallel vacuum worker
DETAIL:  CPU: user: 0.88 s, system: 0.27 s, elapsed: 2.60 s
...</code></pre></div>
<p>Parallel VACUUM occurs when the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficient parallel workers are available, based on the system-wide limit set by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-MAINTENANCE"><code>max_parallel_maintenance_workers</code></a> (defaults to 2)</li>
<li>There are multiple indexes on the table (one index can be processed by one worker at a time)</li>
<li>Index types support it (all built-in index types support parallelism to some extent)</li>
<li>The indexes are large enough to exceed <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-MIN-PARALLEL-INDEX-SCAN-SIZE"><code>min_parallel_index_scan_size</code></a> (defaults to 512 kB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that <strong>parallel VACUUM is currently not supported for autovacuum.</strong> This new feature is intended for use in manual VACUUM runs that need to complete quickly, such as when insufficient autovacuum tuning has lead to an imminent TXID wraparound, and you need to intervene to fix it.</p>
<p>On that note, an important <code>autovacuum</code> improvement in Postgres 13 is that the autovacuum background process can now be triggered by <code>INSERT</code> statements for append-only tables. The main purpose of VACUUM is to clean up old versions of updated and deleted rows, but it is also essential to set pages as all-visible for MVCC bookkeeping. All-visible pages allow index-only scans to avoid checking visibility status row-by-row, making them faster.</p>
<p>We make extensive use of append-only tables at pganalyze for our timeseries data, and this improvement will make our lives considerably easier, avoiding the occasional manual VACUUM run on these tables. This new behavior can be controlled by the <code>autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold</code> and <code>autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor</code> variables.</p>
<h3 id="incremental-sorting"><a href="#incremental-sorting" aria-label="incremental sorting permalink"></a>Incremental Sorting</h3>
<p>Sorting data is a common database task, and Postgres has a number of features to avoid unnecessary work
here. For example, if you have a B-Tree index on a column, and you query your table ordered by that column,
it can just scan that index in order to get sorted data.</p>
<p>In Postgres 13, this is improved to handle partially sorted data. If you have an index on <code>(a, b)</code> (or
the data is already sorted by <code>(a, b)</code> for another reason), and you issue a query to order by <code>(a, b, c)</code>,
Postgres understands that the input data is already partially sorted, and can avoid re-sorting the whole
dataset. This is especially useful if you have a <code>LIMIT</code> in your query, since this can avoid even more
work.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring"><a href="#monitoring" aria-label="monitoring permalink"></a>Monitoring</h2>
<p>Monitoring improvements in Postgres 13 include more details on <code>WAL</code> usage, more options for logging your
queries, and more information on query planning.</p>
<h3 id="wal-usage-stats"><a href="#wal-usage-stats" aria-label="wal usage stats permalink"></a>WAL Usage Stats</h3>
<p>The write-ahead log (<code>WAL</code>) ensures your data stays consistent in the event of a crash, even mid-write. Consistency
is a fundamental property of databases—it ensures your transaction either committed or did not commit; you don't
have to worry about in-between states. But on a busy system, <code>WAL</code> writes can often be a bottleneck. To help
diagnose this, Postgres 13 includes more information on <code>WAL</code> usage from your queries.</p>
<p><code>EXPLAIN</code> now supports information about <code>WAL</code> records generated during execution:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>EXPLAIN</span> <span>(</span><span>ANALYZE</span><span>,</span> WAL<span>)</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> users<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                                                    QUERY PLAN                                                     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Delete on users  (cost=0.00..5409.00 rows=100000 width=6) (actual time=108.910..108.911 rows=0 loops=1)
   WAL: records=100000 fpi=741 bytes=11425721
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..5409.00 rows=100000 width=6) (actual time=8.519..51.850 rows=100000 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 6.083 ms
 Execution Time: 108.955 ms
(5 rows)</code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that the <code>WAL</code> line includes the number of records generated, the number of full page images (fpi), and
the number of <code>WAL</code> bytes generated. Only non-zero values are printed in the default text format.</p>
<p>This is also available in <code>pg_stat_statements</code>. For example, on our staging environment, here is what we ran to get
the statement that produced the most <code>WAL</code> records:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> query<span>,</span> calls<span>,</span> wal_records<span>,</span> wal_fpi<span>,</span> wal_bytes <span>FROM</span> pg_stat_statements
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> wal_records <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
query       | CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE upsert_data (server_id uuid NOT NULL, backend_id uuid NOT NULL,
            | query_start timestamp NOT NULL, query_fingerprint bytea NOT NULL, query_text text NOT NULL)
calls       | 7974948
wal_records | 966960816
wal_fpi     | 1018412
wal_bytes   | 100086092097</code></pre></div>
<p>Like many other values in <code>pg_stat_statements</code>, the <code>wal_records</code>, <code>wal_fpi</code>, and <code>wal_bytes</code> values here are
cumulative since the last <code>pg_stat_statements_reset</code> call.</p></div></div></div>

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.Green leaves are fundamental for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Their pigments are the predominant signal seen from space. Nitrogen uptake and carbon assimilation by plants and the decomposability of leaves drive biogeochemical cycles. Animals, fungi and other heterotrophs in ecosystems are fuelled by photosynthate, and their habitats are structured by the stems on which leaves are deployed. Plants invest photosynthate and mineral nutrients in the construction of leaves, which in turn return a revenue stream of photosynthate over their lifetimes. The photosynthate is used to acquire mineral nutrients, to support metabolism and to re-invest in leaves, their supporting stems and other plant parts.There are more than 250,000 vascular plant species, all engaging in the same processes of investment and reinvestment of carbon and mineral nutrients, and all making enough surplus to ensure continuity to future generations. These processes of investment and re-investment are inherently economic in nature [1][2][3] . Understanding how these processes vary between species, plant functional types and the vegetation of different biomes is a major goal for plant ecology and crucial for modelling how nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries will shift with land-use and climate change.
Data set and parametersWe formed a global plant trait network (Glopnet) to quantify leaf economics across the world's plant species. The Glopnet data set spans 2,548 species from 219 families at 175 sites (approximately 1% of the extant vascular plant species). The coverage of traits, species and sites is at least tenfold greater than previous data compilations [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] , extends to all vegetated continents, and represents a wide range of vegetation types, from arctic tundra to tropical rainforest, from hot to cold deserts, from boreal forest to grasslands. Site elevation ranges from below sea level (Death Valley, USA) to 4,800 m. Mean annual temperature (MAT) ranges from 216.5 8C to 27.5 8C; mean annual rainfall (MAR) ranges from 133 to 5,300 mm per year.

Furthermore, this morbidity is more highly concentrated than previously recognized in roughly one sixth of the population who have a history of three or more comorbid disorders. This suggests that the causes and consequences of high comorbidity should be the focus of research attention. The majority of people with psychiatric disorders fail to obtain professional treatment. Even among people with a lifetime history of three or more comorbid disorders, the proportion who ever obtain specialty sector mental health treatment is less than 50%. These results argue for the importance of more outreach and more research on barriers to professional help-seeking.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><i><span>British Journal of Social Psychology</span></i> volume 40, issue 4, P471-499</span></p><p><span>The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has received considerable attention in the literature. The present study is a quantitative integration and review of that research. From a database of 185 independent studies published up to the end of 1997, the TPB accounted for 27% and 39% of the variance in behaviour and intention, respectively. The perceived behavioural control (PBC) construct accounted for significant amounts of variance in intention and behaviour, independent of theory of reasoned action variables. When behaviour measures were self-reports, the TPB accounted for 11% more of the variance in behaviour than when behaviour measures were objective or observed (R2s = .31 and .21, respectively). Attitude, subjective norm and PBC account for significantly more of the variance in individuals' desires than intentions or self-predictions, but intentions and self-predictions were better predictors of behaviour. The subjective norm construct is generally found to be a weak predictor of intentions. This is partly attributable to a combination of poor measurement and the need for expansion of the normative component. The discussion focuses on ways in which current TPB research can be taken forward in the light of the present review.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><i><span>The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and M</span></i> volume 56, issue 3, PM146-M157</span></p><p>No abstract</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><i><span>Nat Rev Neurosci</span></i> volume 3, issue 3, P201-215</span></p><p><span>We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i> volume 358, issue 9286, P958-965</span></p><p><span>In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the most effective therapy is the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 microg/kg per week plus ribavirin.

<p>On Sunday, 31, May 2020, shortly before we put our kids down for nap, an
analyst mentioned that he noticed a significant (~30%) reduction in log
volume from my service. He couldn’t make heads or tails of it and asked if I
could take a look.</p>
<p>Once the boys were down I started to investigate. It was an effective
distraction from the helicopters, protesting, and eventual rioting going on
only four blocks from my apartment.</p>
<p>That whole day (and part of the following day) <a href="#sql-to-investigate-logs">I used Athena and SQLite to
analyze the logs</a>. In the end I found no pattern other
than some scant log loss.</p>
<p>The most typical cause of log loss is emitting non-json interleaved with json,
which would implicate something in my service. I checked for that and found no
evidence that it had been happening.</p>
<p>One of the product people who were pitching in while I was digging asked if
this reduction in records could be organic. There were helicopters! People
were legit rioting! Also COVID-19 had sent people home in the prior two weeks.
Did the civil unrest really reduce our traffic by 30%?</p>
<p>My assumption was that we were legitimately losing logs, it was not caused by a
simple bug affecting the data, but instead a systemic bug in either the logging
library or the logging infrastructure itself (which has for years been
incredibly resilient.)</p>
<p>At some point <a href="https://www.aaronhopkins.com/">Aaron</a> looked at the rate at
which we were logging. We built our logging pipeline to support up to 10
megabytes logged per second. This thing was logging <em>50 megabytes per second.</em>
Yikes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me take a this opportunity to explain the interface to our logging system,
along with some details about how that’s implemented. The interface is
deceptively simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications log to standard out and standard error</li>
<li>The logs must be JSON</li>
</ul>
<p>Logs are intended to be available to engineers within a few minutes (but
often are available within seconds.)</p>
<p>The implementation (at least the very beginning of it) is that we have a
program called <code>tsar</code> that works as both a supervisor and log capturer. It
captures the logs and wraps them in JSON if it needs to. It sets the pipe
buffer size on stdout and stderr so our logs can be atomically written for our
required size (1 megabyte.)</p>
<p>That then reëmits the logs, but serially such that they will never be
interleaved. As it stands today, Docker captures those and writes them to disk
in configurably sized chunks before starting to write to a new file. It deletes
the old files after there are too many other files, again configurably.</p>
<p>Another tool, <code>filebeat</code>, picks up the files as they are written to and streams
the files up to kafka. <code>filebeat</code> notices writes via <code>inotify</code> and keeps the
files open, so in theory you can never lose data.</p>
<p>The problem is, it only checks for <em>new files</em> every so often (maybe every 20
seconds.) I don’t recall the exact numbers, but basically the size of the
files docker was writing were something like 100 Megs, and it would keep up to
five around. So we were writing 50 megs per second to 100 megabyte files and
only keep five of them. In total this means we buffer a mere 10 seconds of
logs on disk in this situation.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was worsened when Aaron had made the application that was logging more
efficient, and packed it into fewer containers with more cores. Instead of
before, running (something like) 20 two cpu containers (each theoretically
logging 25 megs per second) we were now running 10 four cpu containers, now
logging the extreme 50 megs per second. Ok so fine, we revert this efficiency
change, increase the file size docker uses to buffer logs, and move on.</p>
<hr>
<p>A few days pass and someone on the analytics team says: “fREW, we are logging
records that we shouldn’t be for X.” This is not unusual; it’s a new project,
mistakes are made and we fix them and move on. The odd detail here is that I
had <em>explicitly</em> written code to handle this case, because we knew these
records were worthless.</p>
<p>Here’s the buggy code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang">		<span>switch</span> <span>distiller</span>.(<span>type</span>) {
		<span>case</span> <span>theCoolAPI</span>:
			<span>/* HEY */</span> <span>pjResp</span>.<span>AllJobs</span>[<span>i</span>].<span>ImpressionLogged</span> = <span>/* HEY */</span> <span>true</span> <span>// IF SOMEONE COPY PASTES THIS CODE I'LL FIND YOU.
</span><span></span>		<span>default</span>:</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s the fix:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang">		<span>switch</span> <span>distiller</span>.(<span>type</span>) {
		<span>case</span> <span>*</span><span>theCoolAPI</span>:
			<span>/* HEY */</span> <span>pjResp</span>.<span>AllJobs</span>[<span>i</span>].<span>ImpressionLogged</span> = <span>/* HEY */</span> <span>true</span> <span>// IF SOMEONE COPY PASTES THIS CODE I'LL FIND YOU.
</span><span></span>		<span>default</span>:</code></pre></div>
<p>Did you catch that? It’s <em>a single character fix.</em> The problem is, the
<code>distiller</code> value could be implemented by either a <code>theCoolAPI</code> value or a
pointer to it (<code>*theCoolAPI</code>.) Worse: it had worked previously, but in
the course of regular changes, because we needed to start mutating a value, I
replaced what actually used to be a <code>theCoolAPI</code> value with a pointer to one.</p>
<p>Gracious. So I fix this, but this time <a href="#test-to-validate-the-fix">I wrote a test, to ensure that this
very subtle behavior will not regress.</a></p>
<p>I rolled it out with a sneaking suspicion, wait a few hours, and check our log
rate.</p>
<p>Before the change: 50 megabytes per second, after the change <strong>five megabytes
per second.</strong> We knew these records were high volume and low value, but of
course we never really considered how high volume they were before. Nearly
<em>ten times the rest of the volume of the system.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>This was such a frustrating incident. To fix it we needed to rope in high
level app devs, low level system people who worked on the logging pipeline, and
lower level people who knew how we’d integrated the pipeline with kubernetes.
And that wasn’t even the “real” root cause! The fundamental issue was that
a type assertion in Go was subtly wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><a href="#the-takeaway" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗 </a> The Takeaway</h2>
<p>To me this emphasizes one specific idea and one general idea.</p>
<p>The specific idea is, when you are doing type assertions in Go, you really
should have a test that validates that it is correct. Frustratingly, errors
are checked via type assertions and can be incredibly difficult to trigger in a
test. Also: if you injected the error via a mock, you are not actually testing
the codepath that you should be checking. <em>angst</em></p>
<p>The general idea is: root causes are fractal. It would be nice if there were a
single issue here, but real production incidents are almost never that simple.
These complex systems, both social and technical, fail in more ways than you
will ever guess. I am regularly rewarded by diving deeper, or fixing the issue
“a layer lower” to categorically solve issues.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data here; so much that two days of data (which I am
analyzing below) wouldn’t even fit on my laptop (about 22 gigs per day.)</p>
<p>I started off by running an Athena query to get a small subset of the logs I
could look at in more depth:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
  <span>FROM</span> data_logs
 <span>WHERE</span> log_date <span>=</span> <span>20200529</span> <span>and</span>
       placement_id <span>=</span> <span>37864</span> <span>and</span>
       to_hex(md5(to_utf8(impression_set_id))) <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%FF'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above query, I hash <code>impression_set_id</code> with md5 and then use <code>LIKE
'%FF'</code> to get a 256th of it.</p>
<p>I changed the date to <code>20200501</code> to compare to a working subset as well.</p>
<p>I downloaded the results from Athena as CSV into sensibly named files. That
gave me a pleasantly small (~88 megs) dataset to work with. I then used SQLite
to dig into that data:</p>
<pre><code>create table old("actual_daily_spend_millicents","bid_millicents","campaign_id","engine_cargo","engine_id","expected_daily_spend_millicents","impression_id","is_predicted_giveaway","is_tracking_daily_spend","job_id","outer_request_id","placement_buyer_rules_uri","placement_cargo","placement_id","request_id","sort_position","target_daily_spend_millicents","viewer_id","viewer_property_id","log_timestamp_string","load_timestamp_utc","jobs_skipped","impression_set_id","impression_superset_id","built_for_viewer_id","built_for_viewer_realm","listing_key","listing_version","buyer_bid_millicents","log_date");
.mode csv
.import 2020-05-01.csv old
create table new("actual_daily_spend_millicents","bid_millicents","campaign_id","engine_cargo","engine_id","expected_daily_spend_millicents","impression_id","is_predicted_giveaway","is_tracking_daily_spend","job_id","outer_request_id","placement_buyer_rules_uri","placement_cargo","placement_id","request_id","sort_position","target_daily_spend_millicents","viewer_id","viewer_property_id","log_timestamp_string","load_timestamp_utc","jobs_skipped","impression_set_id","impression_superset_id","built_for_viewer_id","built_for_viewer_realm","listing_key","listing_version","buyer_bid_millicents","log_date");
.import 2020-05-29.csv new
</code></pre>
<p>I verified our initial observations:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(*) from (select DISTINCT(impression_set_id) FROM old);
1128
sqlite&gt; select count(*) from (select DISTINCT(impression_set_id) FROM new);
758
</code></pre>
<p>My first instinct was that somehow we were filtering the data that was
being logged, so I made a scrappy histogram of the sets of data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select c from (select COUNT(*) AS c FROM old group by impression_set_id) order by c LIMIT 1 OFFSET cast(0.5*1128 as int);
59
sqlite&gt; select c from (select COUNT(*) AS c FROM old group by impression_set_id) order by c LIMIT 1 …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

            <p>“Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested,” says Professor <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/hanlju">Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren</a> at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. “If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.”</p>

<p>T-cell analyses are more complicated to perform than antibody tests and at present are therefore only done in specialised laboratories, such as that at the Center for Infectious Medicine at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>“Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related,” says Marcus Buggert.</p>

    <li><strong>Dynamic Scoping in C++</strong> </li>

    </ol>

           
  <p><i>Date: 2020-07-10</i></p><p>I always had a faible for dynamic scoping as it is implemented in
Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, or LaTeX. To me, it seems that dynamic
scoping is an almost forgotten technique and dismissed technique in
modern programming. While it is more complex to understand and more
magically than lexical scoping, there are some applications that
benefit from dynamic scoping.</p>
<p>In lexical scoping, if you access a variable, your compiler will start
searching the declaration from the point of reference outwards in
lexical order. This means it searches first in the most inner scope,
and continoues to widen its search scope by the "closed-nested-scope
rule". For example, in the following code snippet, the call to <code>foo()</code>
would return 23, as the lexcially-closest declaration is the global variable.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d</span><span>\"</span><span>, foo());</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With dynamic scoping, the world would look different as the closest
(time-wise) dynamic binding for a given name is found instead of
lexically closest. In the example, <code>foo()</code> would return 42, as the
binding in <code>bar()</code> happened more recently that the global binding.</p>
<p>You can think of a dynamically-scoped global variable as shadowable
global binding. By creating a new binding for the variable, we shadow
the old binding, and all references in child functions will now refer
to the new binding, although they have not received the value via an
argument transfer. Ergo, dynamically-scoped variables are shadowable
side-channels that can influence the behavior of a function.</p>
<p>For example, in Common Lisp, the variable <code>*standard-output*</code> is
dynamically scoped and functions <code>(print)</code> simply send there
characters to that variable. As it is dynamically scoped, we can just
redirect all output to a file by creating a new binding for
<code>*standard-output*</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>with-open-file</span> <span>(</span><span>*standard-output*</span> <span>"somefile.dat"</span> <span>:direction</span> <span>:output</span>
                                   <span>:if-exists</span> <span>:supersede</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span><span>print</span> <span>"this goes into file"</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Wouldn't it be neat to do the same in, let's say, C++? Luckily, with
templates, the RAII pattern, and some template magic, we can write
code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>G</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"bar "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>BindInstance</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>G</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"main1 "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>();</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"main2 "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>*</span><span>G</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and end up with the output:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="update-23092020-multi-threaded-programs">[UPDATE 23.09.2020] Multi-Threaded Programs</h2>
<p>After some discussion on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24544716">HackerNews</a> (which I
highly recommend to read), I was made aware that the previous
implementation has a problem with multi-threaded programs. As all
threads share the same global objects as a root to their dynamic-scope
value stack, bindings in one thread had an influence on the bindings
in another thread. Of coure, this would be a broken version of dynamic
scoping.</p>
<p>The problem can be circumvented by making the global variable thread local:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>thread_local</span> <span>DynamicScope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>G</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With this, every thread has its own version of the G object, which
internally is the head of a linked list of the shadowed values.
However, someone could forget the add the required thread_local attribute.</p>
<p>Unluckily, checking whether the storage class of a given variable is
thread_local is not that trivial. However, I came up with a rather
low-cost sanity check that ensures that a variable must be declared
<code>thread_local</code>. The updated version of <code>DynamicScope&lt;T&gt;</code>, as well as
some benchmarking code, can be found here:    <a href="https://blog.dokucode.de/posts/2020-07-10-Dynamic-Scoping-in-CPP/thread_dynamic_scope.cc">thread_dynamic_scope.cc</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                          By monitoring brain function, computers can be made to imagine what a person is thinking of and present the results as images. The technique can be utilised in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, as well as supporting human creativity.               </p><div>
                          <div><p>Researchers at the University of Helsinki have developed a technique in which a computer models visual perception by monitoring human brain signals. In a way, it is as if the computer tries to imagine what a human is thinking about. As a result of this imagining, the computer is able to produce entirely new information, such as fictional images that were never before seen.</p>
<p>The technique is based on a novel brain-computer interface. Previously, similar brain-computer interfaces have been able to perform one-way communication from brain to computer, such as spell individual letters or move a cursor.</p>
<p>As far as is known, the new study is the first where both the computerâ€™s presentation of the information and brain signals were modelled simultaneously using artificial intelligence methods. Images that matched the visual characteristics that participants were focusing on were generated through interaction between human brain responses and a generative neural network.</p>
<p>The study was published in the <em>Scientific Reports</em> journal in September. Scientific Reports is an online multidisciplinary, open-access journal from the publishers of <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Neuroadaptive generative modelling </strong></h2>
<p>The researchers call this method neuroadaptive generative modelling. A total of 31 volunteers participated in a study that evaluated the effectiveness of the technique. Participants were shown hundreds of AI-generated images of diverse-looking people while their EEG was recorded.</p>
<p>The subjects were asked to concentrate on certain features, such as faces that looked old or were smiling. While looking at a rapidly presented series of face images, the EEGs of the subjects were fed to a neural network, which inferred whether any image was detected by the brain as matching what the subjects were looking for.</p>
<p>Based on this information, the neural network adapted its estimation as to what kind of faces people were thinking of. Finally, the images generated by the computer were evaluated by the participants and they nearly perfectly matched with the features the participants were thinking of. The accuracy of the experiment was 83 per cent.</p>
<p>â€œThe technique combines natural human responses with the computer's ability to create new information. In the experiment, the participants were only asked to look at the computer-generated images. Â&nbsp;The computer, in turn, modeled the images displayed and the human reaction toward the images by using human brain responses. From this, the computer can create an entirely new image that matches the user's intention,â€� says <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/tuukka-ruotsalo-9089453"><strong>Tuukka Ruotsalo</strong></a>, Academy of Finland Research Fellow at the University of Helsinki, Finland and Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<h2><strong>Unconscious attitudes may be exposed</strong></h2>
<p>Generating images of the human face is only one example of the techniqueâ€™s potential uses. One practical benefit of the study may be that computers can augment human creativity.</p>
<p>â€œIf you want to draw or illustrate something but are unable to do so, the computer may help you to achieve your goal. It could just observe the focus of attention and predict what you would like to create,â€� Ruotsalo says.</p>
<p>However, the researchers believe that the technique may be used to gain understanding of perception and the underlying processes in our mind.</p>
<p>â€œThe technique does not recognise thoughts but rather responds to the associations we have with mental categories. Thus, while we are not able to find out the identity of a specific â€˜old personâ€™ a participant was thinking of, we may gain an understanding of what they associate with old age. We, therefore, believe it may provide a new way of gaining insight into social, cognitive and emotional processes,â€� says Senior Researcher <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/michiel-spape-9362108"><strong>Michiel SpapÃ©</strong></a>.</p>
<p>According to SpapÃ©, this is also interesting from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p>â€œOne person's idea of an elderly person may be very different from another's. We are currently uncovering whether our technique might expose unconscious associations, for example by looking if the computer always renders old people as, say, smiling men.â€�</p>

September 21, 2020 | https://molodtsov.me/2020/09/a-comparative-review-of-ios-browsers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://molodtsov.me/2020/09/a-comparative-review-of-ios-browsers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body"><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/post.png" alt=""></p><p>iOS 14 has finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444995/ios-14-default-browsers-chrome-edge-firefox-duckduckgo-safari">added</a> an option to set third-party browsers and email clients as the default. Unfortunately, iOS still imposes certain limitations on all of them. If you also count these browsers’ own shortfalls, for the best possible experience you might want to stay on Safari.</p><p>In the past two years I switched from Safari to Chrome to Firefox to Edge and then back to Chrome. I also used their respected mobile versions so I could sync my data with the desktop (or at least some data).</p><p>If you use <strong>any</strong> third-party browser you will lose a few features.</p><h2 id="content-blockers">Content Blockers</h2><p>Content Blockers are a recent Apple solution for ad blocking. It’s supposed to be the more private since these extensions don’t get access to your browser and its history. Instead, they provide a list of patterns that Safari would block on its own. The one I use is called <a href="https://giorgiocalderolla.com/wipr.html">WIRP</a>. Content blockers don’t work in third-party browsers by design. If you want to have an ad-free experience with third-party browsers you have to use something like <a href="https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html">AdGuard</a>. It works by launching an on-device VPN that blocks the ads at the DNS level.</p><h2 id="password-autofill">Password Autofill</h2><p>When Safari detects a login form it automatically suggests to fill it with the account it finds relevant. Sometimes it makes mistakes, especially if you have several accounts on a single website (Hey Google) but it’s definitely nice to have. This feature doesn’t work in third-party browsers – presumably so other apps couldn’t mask as your browser and get any kind of access to your passwords. You have to manually tap on the password field and then you’ll see a “<em>Passwords</em>” button on top of your keyboard.</p><p>The problem? A lot of websites expect you to log in via multiple options, include SSO providers (Single Sign-On). So they only show you the email field first in case you have one of these accounts that would be accessible without its own password. So in third-party browsers you have to manually type your login/email and then tap the password field when it appears and tap “Passwords”. For a person used to password managers like 1Password, it’s not a great experience.</p><h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2><p>Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox – all of them use mobile WebKit on iOS. But for some reason, they still occasionally show bugs and visual glitches that aren’t present in Safari. The two I see most often: horizontal jiggle while scrolling and sudden left-right margins added if I switch back-and-forth from the browser.</p><hr><p>Now let’s look at these browsers themselves. Some people say that third-party browsers on iOS are just Safari in disguise. They’re mostly right, but users care more about the browser features and its ability to sync their data, not the underlying engine.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/chrome.png" alt=""></p><p>Chrome is the most popular browser on the planet, it has about <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">65%</a> market share. It’s natural a lot of people would choose Chrome on their iPhones and iPads as well.</p><p>With Chrome it often feels that its iOS version is developed by a completely different team that doesn’t speak with their big brother much.</p><p>Chrome for desktop has a reader mode. Chrome for Android has a reader mode. Chrome for iOS doesn’t. On a smallish mobile screen, it’s often the only way to properly read articles on the modern web. And Safari Reader Mode is just fantastic, so it’s always sad to live without it.</p><p>Chrome for iOS does have a feature called reading list that allows saving articles to read later. Chrome for desktop doesn’t have it, so this list doesn’t sync with other devices.</p><p>I definitely prefer the tab switching menu on Chrome. The one in Safari might look nice but isn’t great when you have a lot of tabs opened. The problem is, this interface reeks Android – and not with its best parts. For instance, it has no gestures to close a tab. The only way is to tap a small [x]. Every time.</p><p>Chrome has a very basic context menu for links. When you force press a link in Safari, you get a preview and context options. In Chrome force pressing a link doesn’t give you anything, even on iPhone XS that supports it. You have to make a long press which gives you just a basic context menu. At the same time, you can force press the menubar icons on the bottom to get more options. I don’t understand why they would have such a discrepancy. And as you will see later, <em>all</em> other browsers at least show a preview.</p><p>Chrome does sync all key data: passwords, history, open tabs – with the desktop version and it’ll probably be enough for most people. Recently it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/30/chrome-ios-password-manager/">added</a> an option to act as a password manager across iOS. If Chrome is your primary browser on desktop and you keep all your passwords there this feature allows you to access them across iOS and all other apps and not just websites.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/edge.png" alt=""></p><p>Edge is a Microsoft-flavored Chrome. The first time I tried it, it felt a bit weird but with time I realized it’s a better Chrome with less reliance on Google and its shady practices.</p><p>Edge for iOS was released in 2017. It didn’t have tab syncing. Then they replaced it because the desktop version went Chromium in 2019. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066767/microsoft-edge-chromium-new-browser-windows-mac-download-os">promised</a> to add syncing for tabs and history between Edge iOS and MacOS later. It still hasn’t delivered that (the latest date they talked about was the “summer”).</p><p>Mobile Edge is pretty much consistent with iOS, its features and design. The tab management view is great and allows you to close tabs with a swipe. Force clicking a link shows a preview and a context menu, just like Safari. Edge has a reader mode across all platforms and it’s pretty good.</p><p>If Edge had syncing it’d be a great option. But we still have to wait for this. Unfortunately, this is a consistent theme in Microsoft development efforts where they don’t add promised features or fix small bugs in years – see natural language support in To Do or “Read More” view you get on any newsletter in mobile Outlook.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/firefox.png" alt=""></p><p>Firefox, a rebel alliance against the Chrome empire. And if you’re one of the few people using it, you might find it great on iOS.</p><ul><li>Firefox syncs all data with the desktop version.</li><li>Firefox has a good tab switching window.</li><li>Firefox has a nice reader mode on all platforms, including iOS.</li><li>Force clicking a link shows you a Safari-like preview and a context menu.</li><li>Firefox on iOS has a unique dark mode that forces all websites into black background, something that isn’t possible in any other browser.</li><li>Firefox has a dedicated password manager called Lockwise. If you aren’t using a third-party password manager, installing Lockwise allows you to quickly access the passwords you save in Firefox across iOS and all other apps – that’s a great feature that Firefox had long before Chrome.</li><li>Firefox doesn’t support Apple Handoff in both directions, unlike Chromium-related browsers.</li></ul><p>If you like Firefox on the desktop, it’s a great option for iOS. But all recent layoffs, deprecation of products, and lack of development on the PWA side don’t instill a lot of hope into the project.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/brave.png" alt="Brave"></p><p>Brave is another Chromium-based browser. I don’t have as much experience with it as with other apps but tried to immerse myself in it. Brave recently added full-scale sync for Android and desktop and promises to bring iOS on par with it. So far it doesn’t sync history and open tabs.</p><p>Generally Brave looks similar to Edge in terms of features:</p><ul><li>Brave has a good tab switching window.</li><li>Brave has a nice reader mode on iOS.</li><li>Force clicking a link shows you a Safari-like preview and a context menu.</li></ul><p>Brave has a couple of unique things:</p><ul><li>Brave shows tabs on top just like browsers on desktop or iPad. These targets are rather small but some people might like it.</li><li>Brave has its own ad-blocking which is very helpful in the absence of content blockers.</li></ul><hr><p>So far I’m not able to switch the default settings because none of the third-party browsers feel like a first-class citizen. And when you add their own shortcomings, whether that’s an absence of sync or issues with their UI, Safari still seems like the best choice for regular web browsing.</p></section></div>]]>

Alone in my home office, I can feel my stomach sink and flood with acid and my face bloom hot. I realize I pushed code to production just a few hours ago. Is this incident my fault? As I begin to click into the various alert messages and take stock of what is happening, I can already hear myself inside my head:</p><p>“I failed to test my changes in our staging environment.”</p><p>“We should have better automated testing. We should have hired full-time QA people!”</p><p>“The people who wrote the code I was fixing should have done a better job in the first place.”</p><p>“I didn’t want to work on this stupid ticket anyway.”</p><p>“The users who are reporting this problem should just go away and do something else. Users are dumb.”</p><p>“I should find a new career! I hate this.”</p><p>After a few minutes of reading monitors and error logs and some brief investigations of our production systems, I see the problematic alerts resolve themselves. The chirping stops. The red dots disappear. There was a network problem far upstream from our applications that caused a brief interruption to all systems.</p><p>It wasn’t my fault. And yet I underwent a complex physiological and emotional experience, and constructed a complete, defensive, negative narrative in my own mind, all in the span of a few minutes, without ever speaking to or even seeing another human being.</p><p>What was going on? Shame.</p><h2>Emotional literacy at Truss</h2><p>Truss emphasizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence"><span>emotional intelligence</span></a> in our hiring practice. We look for people capable of and committed to <a href="https://truss.works/values"><span>practicing self- and situational awareness</span></a>. We also ask ourselves to act without fear. Often, these values mean we need to gently interrogate ourselves and reflect on the complicated emotional reactions we have in our work, in meetings, conversations, coding, design and research, planning, and yes, incident response. It’s not therapy (though that sometimes helps, outside the work context). It’s the capacity for using language to reflect on and speak about our human experiences. This is not simply an individual exercise in self-actualization. It’s good business. We interact with other humans – our clients, our partners, our colleagues – all day long, and playing well with others makes for good partnerships and successful projects.</p><p>Make no mistake, it’s work. Emotional labor is real labor, even if it is often not visible in the same way as lines of code, wireframes, research reports, or sales proposals. Reading code requires a certain literacy. So does reading situations. That’s why we spend time on things like emotional literacy.</p><p>One of the emotional dynamics I observe frequently in my work life is shame, both in myself and others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame"><span>Shame</span></a> is a primary human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_theory"><span>affect</span></a> that can result in complicated emotions and behaviors. I have found that a recognition and effective response to shame, in myself and others, has been crucial in my professional life. This post briefly defines shame, describes some emotional and organizational patterns related to shame, and discusses a few practical approaches to managing shame, both as an individual and an organization.</p><h2>What is shame?</h2><p>Shame is the experience of feeling seen in a painful and diminished sense, of being evaluated and identified as lacking in some respect. Shame is biological. It can be intensely, internally uncomfortable, because the physical effect of shame is to amplify our awareness of ourselves and our environment. Shame exists before thinking or language. We might feel small, stuck, bound, captured, frozen, powerless, or hijacked. We are speechless or we stammer. Some people fidget. Some people get intensely still, as if by not moving they will no longer be seen.</p><p>Shame is an experience of exposure and self-consciousness. When we feel shame, we often feel it first in our face. Think of all the ways the word “face” reflects shame-related situations. We face the consequences; we can (or cannot) face up to a task; we put on a brave face, or we have egg on our face, or we can’t show our faces around here. We are self-effacing (literally, removing our faces), or we are trying to save face. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter"><span><em>The Scarlet Letter</em></span></a>, Hawthorne’s famous story about shame, the townspeople punish the heroine most profoundly by preventing her from hiding her face.</p><p>Of course, being seen is, by itself, not shameful. On the contrary, being seen by another person is often positive. The shortest verbal affirmation on social media these days is something like “I see you.” Being recognized and acknowledged can produce the opposite of shame, particularly if the other person likes us or is pleased to see us. The key piece of the shame experience is the part where we are found lacking or inadequate. Shame is the feeling that fills the gap between the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html#ideal"><span>ideal self and real self</span></a>. Shame is the experience of not measuring up. The wider the gap, the bigger the potential shame experience.</p><p>Shame is, all by itself, normal. What happens for many of us is that we, and the people around us, lack skills for recovering from the feeling, and so shame can become toxic and internalized, so that the act of being seen is something we carry around with us all the time, like a self-recharging flashlight. Every time we turn it on, it gets stronger for the next time. We can also develop strong memories of prior shame experiences, which can begin to shape our behavior as we try to avoid repeating the experience. The fear of shame can become a powerful (and often hidden) motivation and impulse behind our words and actions.</p><p>A feeling of abandonment often accompanies shame, the feeling of another person turning their own face away from us in judgement. Shame is always relational, but significantly, we can feel shame without another person present. This is particularly true when we have internalized the shame pattern to the point where we can act out the entire drama of being seen and casting judgement, all by ourselves. We split our inner self into the one who shames and the one who is shamed. Many of us learn that pattern as children, and many of us carry forward an internalized and magnified sense of shame because we have learned to constantly observe and evaluate ourselves. We sometimes refer to this pattern as the little voice in our heads that judges us.</p><h2>Patterns and symptoms</h2><p>If you have read this far, you may have already found yourself feeling uncomfortable. One of the ironies of shame is that it can be shameful to name. Being near someone who is experiencing something shameful can be itself shameful for the rest of us. Shame is highly contagious. When someone on the huge Zoom call is not muted and we hear something we probably should not, we can all feel awkward. The symptoms are often the same for the witnesses and the ashamed. We avert our eyes. We look away. Cover our faces. When we feel shame we feel seen, so we want to escape and hide. Sink into the floor. Disappear.</p><p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt#:~:text=So%2C%20first%20of%20all%2C%20let,to%20convert%20retreat%20into%20advance."><span>FDR’s famous speech about fearing fear itself</span></a>, being ashamed of shame is one of the ways it becomes such a powerful yet hidden motivator in our everyday interactions. Gershen Kaufman, in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1354467.Shame"><span>his essential book on shame</span></a>, coined the phrase “shame spiral” to describe the emotional pattern of a triggering event (the exposure of some inadequacy, real or perceived), the shame affect (the feeling), the shame response to that feeling, and then the awareness of the shame, which itself can be a trigger that creates more shame and so on. After repeated experiences, we can learn to shortcut emotionally from the trigger to the response, very quickly.</p><p>Shame triggers and responses are enculturated, shaped by age, gender, race, class and identities of all kinds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"><span>Imposter Syndrome</span></a> (very common in the digital technology world, where knowledge (the ideal self) evolves so quickly) is a phenomenon rooted in shame. How we experience shame and what we do about it are filtered through language and the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. Events that are seen as shameful in one context may not be in another. But the shame affect itself is universal and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame#Identification"><span>not limited to humans</span></a>, and there are some consistent patterns in how humans respond to shame.</p><p>We often use the word “toxic” to describe people or environments where shame has been weaponized to enforce patterns of power and privilege. You may know or have encountered people who are very good at making other people feel very bad. We use phrases like “hanging them out to dry” or “throwing them under the bus” or “cutting them off at the knees” or “gaslighting” – all violent images that refer to using shame to deflect responsibility, cast blame, or assert power. People who use shame as a weapon may often have highly attuned internalized shame patterns themselves. They may even, at least superficially, seem immune to shaming. The culture of the organization itself can become infused with weaponized, contagious shame. It’s as if there is blame brewed in the office coffee.</p><p>How do we know if we’re in the presence of shame? Obviously we can’t always see when someone is feeling shame, since it’s a profoundly internal experience. Still, there are some clues we can pay attention to. When I observe, in myself or others, the following emotions or behaviors, I often smell shame lurking behind them. While many of these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_theory#Silvan_Tomkins.27s_nine_affects"><span>primary affects</span></a> (biological emotions), they tend to be secondary responses to shame. In other words, we feel exposed first and then as we come unstuck we slide into one or more of these other affects.</p><h3>Blame</h3><p>Blame is essentially pointing away and saying “don’t look at me, look over there instead.” The classic and probably the most common shame response, blame is most visible within organizations and teams, but that does not mean it is always spoken aloud. Sometimes the most hurtful blame is cast only in our internal narratives. Scapegoating is literally the ritual of placing the blame on a goat and sending it away from the community. Blame creates distance (sometimes physical, always …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

                <center><em><p>Rendering minimal surfaces of cubical loops</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Sunday, September 13, 2020 · 3 min read</h4>
<p>A 2014 <a href="https://www.math.ksu.edu/~rozhkovs/LeWitt_cubes.pdf">paper</a> by
Rozhkovskaya and Reb titled “Is the List of Incomplete Open Cubes Complete?”
complicates Sol LeWitt’s celebrated 1974 artwork, “Incomplete Open Cubes”. The
artwork is a <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/691091">gallery</a>
of 122 three-dimensional structures; they are meant to be all distinct
connected subsets of edges of the unit cube that result in a 3D figure — or,
in LeWitt’s words, “all the ways of the cube not being complete”. The
complication, noted by the paper, is that two of the structures are identical
up to rotation; they should instead be mirror reflections of each other.</p>
<p>Have art historians realized yet? I would like to think there is some deeper
philosophical significance to this bit of trivia. The exercise in exhaustive
enumeration of incompleteness is itself incomplete — and, we cannot help but
overlook the incompleteness, just as we cannot help but imagine the missing
edges of any of the 122 almost-cubes.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/incomplete-open-cubes.png" alt="Incomplete Open Cubes"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I have <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/eucalyptus.html">meditated on the art-historical significance of chirality
before</a>, so today I want to talk about something else. I don’t
know about you, but when I see LeWitt’s almost-cubes, I feel the need to
submerge them in a tank of soapy water. Why? To see what shape the films take,
of course! Is that irrational? Perhaps, but <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/146945">writes
LeWitt</a>, “Irrational thoughts
should be followed absolutely and logically.” It turns out that my thought
isn’t hard to follow — if not absolutely and logically, then at least
computationally.</p>
<p>The shape of a soap film is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface">minimal
surface</a>, that is, the surface
with minimal area that obeys the boundary conditions of the “loop” that the
film forms within. The definition doesn’t depend at all on the properties of
soap: any film-forming substance should — in the absence of other forces,
such as gravity — contract to the same shape as a result of surface tension.
These shapes can often be pleasing and unexpected.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/helicoid.png" alt="Soap film on a spring"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Image source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bulle_de_savon_h%C3%A9lico%C3%AFde.PNG">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, because finding the surface is a question of continuous minimization, we
should be able to easily apply automatic differentiation — at least, to a
discretization of the problem.  Here is the algorithm: we start with a mesh
grid of points and triangulate it. Then, we compute the surface area by
repeated application of Heron’s Theorem to the triangles. Finally, we
differentiate the total area with respect to the positions of the points, and
nudge the points towards less area. The full source code for this adventure is
available <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/minimal-surface.ipynb">here</a>. (By the way,
I’m using PyTorch out of habit, but perhaps TensorFlow would be more
appropriate because of its oddly LeWittian logo.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Before I give you the results, I want you to take a moment to try and imagine
what the soap films will look like. I think it’s an interesting exercise in
qualitative reasoning, and, in any case, LeWitt’s work all but pleads for us to
see what isn’t there.</p>
<p>For starters, we can reduce the entire problem from 122 cubes into just a
handful of cases. Simply ask: how many distinct-up-to-symmetry “loops” are
there on a cube?  Let’s do casework by face count: there is 1 loop with one
face (the “square”), 1 loop with two faces (the “L”), and 2 loops with three
faces (the “U” and the “corner”). The rest are accounted for by complement: a
four-face loop is also a two-face loop.</p>
<p>This yields a total of 4 cases — much more manageable! And indeed, I’ll
suggest that you start with Case 1, the “square”, since the answer in that case
should be obvious.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, now, the results!</p>
<p>Case 1 is easy; we already know the answer. The soap film is just flat, because
its boundary is planar.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/case_1.gif" alt="Case 1, the square"></p>
<p>Case 2 is less obvious — I would not have predicted this outcome! It turns
out that the soap film tries to “flatten” itself into the hypotenuse. What are
the implications of this? Well, one implication is that if you want to minimize
the material you use to build a tent (without regard to volume), you can do
better than stretching the material taught into large rectangles. Sagging
actually <em>saves</em> material.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/case_2.gif" alt="Case 2, the &quot;L&quot;"></p>
<p>You might expect Case 3a to flatten similarly, but because of the up-down
symmetry that can’t happen. Instead, you get a beautiful saddle shape.
Actually, it turns out that all minimal surfaces are saddle-like; if they had
nonzero curvature at some point then you should be able to “flatten the bulge”
to reduce surface area.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/case_3a.gif" alt="Case 3a, the &quot;U&quot;"></p>
<p>And finally, Case 3b — sorry this isn’t quite perfectly modeled — tries to
flatten itself around the center, kind of like a tortilla chip.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/minimal-surface/case_3b.gif" alt="Case 3b, the &quot;corner&quot;"></p>

<p>It's shortly before midnight on May 29 when Brian Inganga gets the call. "You have to hurry," the midwife tells him. The 31-year-old photographer immediately jumps on a motorcycle taxi and heads to Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. Inganga is anxious, not only because the slum is "dark and dangerous," as he puts it, but because it's after curfew and "the police are extremely aggressive at night."</p>


<div>
<p>The midwife picks him up on a street corner and leads him through the narrow alleyways to her small shack. On the floor of a tiny room inside lies Veronica Atieno, 23. Her contractions are strong.</p><p>In the hours that follow, Inganga takes photos as the mother gives birth to her daughter, Shaniz Joy Juma. There are no doctors or medical supplies present, just a wooden spoon for the mother to bite on and an herbal mixture from the midwife for the pain. "It was a shocking experience," says the photographer over the phone, as he relates the story behind the photos. "Our women can't go to the hospital to give birth. They lie on the filthy ground and are deeply afraid."</p>

<p>Brian Inganga wanted to document such a birth because he is worried. He grew up in Kibera himself and knows what it means to live in a slum. "Poverty and danger," he says. "And now, everything has become even more difficult. The corona crisis is a threat to women. Many have become pregnant against their will because it is almost possible to find contraception, or they were abused at a young age. And women giving birth face great dangers and have no one to turn to."</p><p>Even before the pandemic, Kenya had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. Although there is hardly any data available yet for 2020, experts and aid organizations believe that the number of women and babies who die during or shortly after birth has risen significantly - not just in Kenya, but around the world.</p>

<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30229-1/fulltext" data-link-flag="external">study </a>by Johns Hopkins University, based on mathematical modeling for 118 countries, forecast a worst-case scenario with the additional deaths of 1 million infants and 56,700 mothers in 2020 because of the pandemic. "It is currently difficult to get precise numbers," says Rebekka Frick, a 43-year-old health expert with Save the Children. "The true effect of the pandemic on the mortality rates of mothers and infants will only become clear in a few years."</p>

<p>"We are more than concerned. That is in part due to reports that we have received from countries like Kenya and Bangladesh, but also due to our knowledge of developments that other epidemics have triggered."</p>

<p>In the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30345-4/fulltext#seccestitle10" data-link-flag="external"> first published study</a> on the influence of the lockdown on births, an international team of scientists analyzed data from nine hospitals in Nepal. They found that the country's lockdown led to a reduction of hospital births of almost 50 percent. Stillbirths and infant deaths rose over the same period by roughly the same amount.</p>

<div>
<p>Similar numbers are expected for many other countries. "We are more than concerned," says Frick. "That is in part due to reports that we have received from countries like Kenya and Bangladesh, but also due to our knowledge of developments that other epidemics have triggered."</p><h3>Seven Dead Infants in a Single Night</h3><p>In some countries in Africa, medical professionals are already sounding the alarm. In Central Hospital, located in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, seven babies died during childbirth on a single night in late July. A doctor <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/DMagombeyi/status/1290401445188112385" data-link-flag="external">tweeted a photo</a> of the infants, lined up next to each other and wrapped in cloth.</p><p>Doctors in South Africa<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53396057" data-link-flag="external"> told the BBC </a>that the maternity ward in the Dora Nginza Hospital in Port Elizabeth is completely overwhelmed. "Several mothers and infants have died" and hospital personnel are "deeply traumatized."</p><p>In both countries, the deaths were partly blamed on severe staff shortages. The majority of health-care workers must focus on treating COVID-19 patients or have been infected themselves. Others are on strike out of fear for their health - due to shortages of protective equipment like masks and gloves. Disinfectant and medicines are also in short supply due to delivery problems. Pregnant women are often forced to wait for days for urgent operations and they frequently cannot be helped in emergency situations or during birth.</p>

<p>"The consequences of the pandemic are catastrophic," says Emma Ingaiza, 32, who works for an NGO called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.shofco.org/" data-link-flag="external">Shining Hope for Communities</a> in Kenya. She has been working almost constantly since the beginning of the corona crisis, helping people in need, including many pregnant women.</p><p>Ingaiza has also read reports recently about the unusual number of stillbirths and mothers dying during birth. "Everyone is panicked due to the coronavirus," she says. "All protective measures and almost all remaining medical personnel are focused on COVID-19. Pregnant women, mothers and babies are suffering as a result."</p><p>In Kenya, she says, some medical facilities where up to 30 children were born every night prior to the coronavirus pandemic have had to close due to a shortage of personnel. Women whose contractions begin in the evening, she says, are afraid to leave their homes due to the brutality with which the police have been enforcing the coronavirus curfew, which has been in place since mid-March. Several people have been beaten by the police, she says, because they were outdoors at night. "Including a man who wanted to drive his pregnant wife to the hospital," says Brian Inganga. "That kind of thing gets around quickly."</p>

<p>In many cases, this has meant home births, with a midwife present in the best-case scenario. But midwives have also had trouble keeping up with demand of late. "Sometimes, they are trying to care for three women with strong contractions, but only have a single pair of gloves," says Inganga, the photographer, who has been in close contact with several midwives in Nairobi for weeks. "What are they supposed to do then?"</p><p>Midwives in Germany and other wealthy countries have noticed that the limits on social contact and the resulting forced inactivity during the pandemic have been good for many mothers-to-be. One <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109793v1" data-link-flag="external">study</a> found that the drop in premature births and other complications is linked to, among other things, lower stress levels.</p><p>But in many other countries around the world -- particularly in poorer ones, where there was a shortage of life-saving medical care for mothers and infants even before the coronavirus pandemic -- there are concerns about rising maternal and infant mortality rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal mortality as a situation when a mother dies during pregnancy or up to 42 days after giving birth. Infant mortality refers to deaths during the first 28 days of life.</p><p>For many aid organizations and scientists, numbers from comparable, past epidemics are important indicators for where we stand now. The West African office of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued guidelines based on the lessons learned from the epidemics seen since 2003. During the Ebola epidemic, for example, which wreaked havoc in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2013 to 2016, constraints on medical care led to an alarming rise in maternal mortality.</p><p>UNFPA is thus recommending that the new COVID-19 crisis teams established in many countries increase their focus on women's health issues.</p><h3><strong>Mothers and Babies Contract the Virus in Hospitals</strong></h3><p>An additional problem is ensuring that the health checkups that generally take place before and after birth actually happen. "In many countries, women are no longer coming to the hospitals because they are afraid of corona," says Rebekka Frick of Save the Children. "They hear that many people are dying there, and they want to protect themselves and their babies."</p><p>Hilda Argüello Avendaño, a doctor with Observatorio de Mortalidad Materna, an NGO monitoring maternal mortality, says that in Mexico, too, this fear has led pregnant women with complications to only seek hospital care as a last resort. Eight children, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/2020/08/12/estados/027n1est" data-link-flag="external">four newborns</a>, recently got infected with the coronavirus in a hospital in Oaxaca.</p><p>"In Mexico, the pandemic has become the primary cause of maternal death," says Avendaño. Compared to the same period last year, she says, the death rate of mothers has risen by more than 25 percent. By the beginning of August, there were 97 cases of women infected with the coronavirus dying during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth.</p>

<p>In around half of those deaths, existing conditions like obesity, diabetes or high blood pressure played a role. The pandemic, though, has revealed social inequalities in the country: Mothers-to-be who do not have insurance and are forced to rely on free state health care face an especially high risk of dying, say doctors, in part because they receive worse care or because care comes too late.</p><p>The decision to forego a visit to the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>By Abril Taker - Content creator at <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=reduce-churn-saas&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a></em>.</p><p>If you’re wondering why, despite all your efforts, your customers are still dropping off your products, then you need to continue reading this article. That, my dear friend, has a name and it’s churn rate. We’re gonna tell you what this means and how you can avoid it for your SaaS business by sharing a few easy strategies that worked for us in <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=reduce-churn-saas&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>.</p><h2>What's customer churn rate?</h2><p>Let’s start with the basics: the easiest definition for churn we found is in this <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-customer-churn">Hubspot</a> article, they just say churn is:</p><blockquote><p><em>People who have cut ties with your company</em>.</p></blockquote><p>It is also known as customer attrition.</p><p>So, we can understand the <strong>churn rate</strong> as</p><blockquote><p><em>A metric that measures the percentage of customers who no longer interact with your business. This may be because they unsuscribed or because they haven’t opened one of your emails in a year or more</em>.</p></blockquote><p>The churn rate is one of the most valuable metrics when applying a customer retention strategy. It allows you to measure if your business vision is having a positive impact on your clients and gives you important feedback to improve.</p><p>As you know, as a member of a SaaS company, subscriptions are one of the most valuable assets. So, customer churn is something that you want to avoid at all cost.</p><p><strong>Here is a universal truth</strong>: It’s less expensive to keep customers than to gain new ones.</p><p>It’s impossible to achieve churn zero. People are constantly changing, and that includes their purchases. Also not all users are gonna like your service for a lot of different reasons, and that’s ok. But it’s important that you try your best to reduce churn and even predict it.</p><h2>Calculate customer churn rate</h2><p>In order to understand what is going on, you have to calculate your customer churn rate.</p><p>The formula to obtain the magic number is quite easy: take the number of customers who churned and divide it for the total of new customers, then multiply the result by 100%.</p><blockquote><p><strong>For example</strong> 1️⃣0️⃣➗1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ = 0️⃣,1️⃣0️⃣✖️ 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣% = 1️⃣0️⃣</p></blockquote><p>The churn rate is calculated over a specific period of time. It’s key to study what’s the best criteria for your company. You can calculate it over a period of a year, monthly or even to ten years, it’s up to you.</p><p>Your minimum goal should be that your churn rate is never higher than your new customers rate. It's like sailing a boat: you always want to keep it "over" the water.</p><h2>How customer churn can affect your business</h2><p>An unexpected increase in the churn rate can mean many things. High churn rate can impact your business in a variety of ways:</p><p>📉 <strong>Wrong strategy</strong>: it doesn't necessarily mean a wrong marketing strategy. It could be that one of your products doesn’t match with user expectations. It could be a lack of performance in the customer service area.</p><p>📉 <strong>Revenue loss</strong>: no clients, no money. As simple as that.</p><p>📉 <strong>Stronger competitors</strong>: If a client isn’t in your nest, she’s in another.</p><p>📉 <strong>It</strong> <strong>can hurt your public image</strong> and translate into more revenue loss. Your investors will not be pleased with this picture.</p><p>Keep in mind that long-term customers bring in a big piece of your revenue. So you have to nurture those relationships.</p><h2>How to avoid customer churn</h2><p>Now the section that you probably were waiting for. The answer to this problem that afflicts us all. In <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=reduce-churn-saas&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we’ve tried different formulas to reduce customer attrition. We're still working on it, but we have found a couple of strategies that worked for us even at an early stage.</p><h3>📌 Actively listen</h3><p>Build the habit of listening to what your clients have to say about your services. They can help you see things that you might be overlooking.</p><p>We like to apply surveys, because we think they are a great way to communicate with our audience. And when you are analyzing churn rate, you should especially use exit surveys. Take into account that they should be short, three questions at most.</p><p>But nothing like an old fashion call to really listen to what they have to say.</p><p>In that way, customer service is your most valuable player, your first line of attack. It’s crucial that, once your customers acquire your services, they feel valued and understood. A happy customer is the best advertising that you can get.</p><h3>📌 Segmentation. Segmentation. Segmentation</h3><p>It's a golden rule that your product should be delivered to the right person, or else you're wasting your time and your money.</p><p>A segmented customer base will aid you in making your services and products more effective. It makes it easier to recognize the requirements that they need.</p><p>Targeting too many clients can backfire. The best thing is to focus on the clients that align with the focus of your business.</p><p>For example: integrations with their favourite platforms. Here in Palabra our public started being exclusively the no-code community, so we started by integrating to their most used platforms, like Webflow, Zapier and Airtable. </p><p>As we started getting some customers with coded products, like other SaaS businesses, we created features to integrate to their preferred apps, like Segment, Hubspot or even direct webhooks integrations.</p><p>✨Remember: deliver the right product or service to the right user.✨</p><h3>📌 Focus on early engagement</h3><p>This is an obvious one, but to prevent churn you have to start working on retention as soon as possible. For that purpose, onboarding strategies work quite well.</p><p>As soon as users sign up for your product, this is the most important moment to engage with them. It’s that moment when they don’t necessarily understand the product quite well and, therefore, can’t take full advantage of it.</p><p>Provide value for your customers as soon as possible and you will win.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=reduce-churn-saas&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we are constantly trying to improve 3 things in our <strong>onboarding:</strong> </p><ul><li>Product: work on UX to make it as easy as possible for people to find their value in your product. We created simple user flows so that automating and triggering emails can be done in a couple of minutes</li><li>Welcoming sequences: Encourage your users to interact with your product multiple times in the first week. Sending automated emails with tutorials could be an excellent method to achieve that (you can use Palabra to create those sequences pretty easily 😉)</li><li>Customer success: make every user feel as important as they are to you. In-app chats are the obvious choices to engage with users as quickly as possible (we've used Crisp and Intercom for that). And quick direct answers are always the best way to go. This gets harder as you grow your user base, but it's always something to keep in mind.</li></ul><p>Now that you know the churn rate basics, you can start to develop strategies to boost your retention engagement and build long term relationships with your customers! 🙌🏾</p><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed this post!

It is a technique to minimizes memory footprint by sharing or avoiding redundancy as much as possible with other similar objects. Flyweight Design Pattern in Modern C++ is often used in a situation where object count is higher which uses an unacceptable amount of memory. Often some parts of these objects can be shared &amp; kept in common data structures that can be used by multiple objects.</p><p>If you haven’t check out my other articles on Structural Design Patterns, then here is the list:</p><ol><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/adapter-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Adapter</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/bridge-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Bridge</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/composite-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Composite</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/decorator-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Decorator</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/facade-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Facade</span></a></strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/flyweight-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Flyweight</span></a> </strong></li><li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vishalchovatiya.com/proxy-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/" target="_blank"><span>Proxy</span></a></strong></li></ol><p>The code snippets you see throughout this series of articles are simplified not sophisticated.

    <p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/working-memory/3-basic-rules-of-productivity-cover.png" alt="3 Basic Rules Of Productivity Cover"></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what happens inside our brain whenever we are thinking about something? How some people have great ideas, are able to learn fast, and are incredibly productive, while others are struggling with finalizing even a simple task? There are many components to this process, and in this article, you will learn about one of them.</p>
<p>Working Memory is one of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-memory-storage-types/">several memory types</a> where information is processed and manipulated before it is either discarded or committed to the long-term storage. Understanding its nuances can allow us to be more efficient in using it and be a bit more productive at what we do.</p>
<p>And since it is at the core of information processing by our brain, the things you are about to learn are independent of the domain you are working in.</p>
<h2 id="an-strikeirstrikerelevant-example-first">An <strike>Ir</strike>relevant Example First</h2>
<p>I don’t know how many articles online make you do exercises, but let’s do one right now. Moreover, I count on your integrity to follow the exercise’s directions since I cannot check you play by the rules.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-description">Exercise Description</h3>
<p>You will see below two blank boxes. Upon clicking on “Show Letters,” you will see two sequences (one after another) of random characters for 7 seconds each.</p>
<p><em>Rule # 1:</em> after you click on the button, you have 7 seconds to read and memorize the first sequence, and 7 seconds for the second one (the sequences will display automatically, you only have to click on the button once).
<em>Rule #2:</em> do not use any note-taking software (doc, excel, text editor, etc.) or hardware (pen and paper, pen and table, pen and walls; a pencil if fine though!). Well, you can, but you will miss the whole point of it.</p>

<p>abcdlmnowxyz</p>
<p>gdluwcemjroc</p>   
<p>Great! How it went? Sorry if you tried to click on a box the second time, and it didn’t show up. I put some sophisticated locking mechanisms in place to prevent that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, there are two more boxes below. Click on each of them, input the characters you memorized, and see how good you have performed on the task.</p>
<div id="boxAnswer1">
    
    <div id="comparisonData1">
        <p>abcdlmnowxyz</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>
<div id="boxAnswer2">
    
    <div id="comparisonData2">
        <p>gdluwcemjroc</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>   
<p>If you got neither of them correctly, do not worry. 7 seconds is quite fast, and, as you will see next, the capacity of Working Memory is limited.</p>
<p>If you did remember only the first one, though, how did you do it? Most people usually memorize it as three distinct subsets: <code>abcd</code> <code>lmno</code> <code>wxyz</code>. It is relatively easy to remember it because of several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of 12 units of information (characters, in this case), you had to memorize much less (3 letters and the length of the groups–4);</li>
<li>you have inherent knowledge about the alphabet (if you, dear reader, are older than 6 years);</li>
<li>you have advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a> abilities that help you discern and group units of information into collections;</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about the second sequence?</p>
<p>How did you attempt to memorize it? Maybe you have split the characters into chunks of 3 or 4 letters and tried to remember the groups, or perhaps you made words out of different adjacent letters and memorized those, or even you came up with a totally different strategy. Anyway, it is usually harder to remember the second sequence. And that is because the amount of information exceeded the capacity of our Working Memory. You had to memorize 12 units of information (or had to search anxiously for some associations to find a way to group those letters), while you have much less space to process at once in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Let’s do one more similar exercise, but this time with numbers.</p>

<p>193919451969</p>
<p>826492104350</p>   
<p>How did it go? You can verify your answers below.</p>
<div id="boxAnswer3">
    
    <div id="comparisonData3">
        <p>193919451969</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>
<div id="boxAnswer4">
    
    <div id="comparisonData4">
        <p>826492104350</p>
        <p>&lt;-- Original sequence</p>
    </div>
    
</div>   

   
<p>There are two main approaches to store the first sequence of digits. The first is to combine them by 2, getting 19, 39, 19, 45, 19, and 69. You have 19 repeating three times, a 39 and 69 that are divisible by three, and a 45 that you just have to remember. But this approach is suboptimal. A more efficient one is to group them by four and use some knowledge of history. You can represent that sequence as three numbers: <code>1939</code>, <code>1945</code>, and <code>1969</code>. The first two are the start and end of the Second World War, and the third is the year of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11 moon landing</a>. So you just need to remember three chunks of information rather than 12. It is another demonstrative example that shows how our brain not only seeks to encode and compress information (as in the previous example with the first character sequence), but also it heavily relies on existing knowledge (as in the case with the WWII and moon landing years). The approaches you take may also vary in their efficiency.</p>
<p>The second one does not have any specific pattern to follow. Maybe you divided the sequence into groups of two or three or even four digits, or perhaps you tried to find a rule to group them. For instance, 82 add up to 10, then 64 add up to 10, but it’s not consistent. You’ll arrive at 92, and it doesn’t add up to 10. The approaches can be very different here, but the conclusion is the same - the second sequence is harder to remember because there is no exact rule or compression algorithm that would facilitate the remembering.</p>
<h2 id="the-working-memory-capacity">The Working Memory Capacity</h2>
<p>We saw that it is hard to memorize a sequence of 12 items, which implies that its capacity should be smaller than that, as otherwise, you would effortlessly remember those 12 pieces of information. But how <strike>big</strike> small is it?</p>
<p>The first quantification of the working memory capacity was provided in 1956 in a paper by George A. Miller titled: <em>“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information."</em> It is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with over 33400 papers that cited it (at the time of writing), according to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=The+magical+number+seven%2C+plus+or+minus+two%3A+Some+limits+on+our+capacity+for+processing+information.&amp;btnG=">Google Scholar</a>. In his paper, Miller claims the working memory capacity to be 7±2 “chunks,” to which I’ll get shortly.</p>
<p>But since 1956, the Working Memory was actively researched and studied, and other theories of its capacity emerged. One such prominent hypothesis is that of Nelson Cowan, who in 2001 published the paper titled <em>“The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity,"</em> in which, you guessed, he suggests a smaller capacity of <em>four chunks.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-chunk-anyway">What Is A Chunk Anyway?</h2>
<p>Since we can store a very limited amount of chunks in the Working Memory for processing, how does one define a <em>chunk?</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no concrete answer to this question because it is a relative measure that depends on the type of information and the pre-existing knowledge of the person who operates with it.</p>
<p>It can vary greatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not familiar with the Russian language, the sequence <code>плюшечка</code> would result in a chunk being the size of an individual letter (or even less), since you don’t have implicit knowledge about it. However, it would represent a single chunk for a Russian speaking person since it is a real word (in a diminutive form).</li>
<li>Distinct words such as <em>job, emotion, productivity</em> may represent single chunks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Combinations of words like <em>“The Fellowship Of The Ring,” “The Two Towers,” “The Return Of The King”</em> can also be considered individual chunks.</li>
<li>Entire sentences can also represent chunks: “Today, I went to the seaside.” or “I am a responsible citizen, and I will vote.”</li>
<li>When thinking about them holistically, even entire chapters and books may represent single chunks, as in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there is no exact size for a chunk, as it depends on different factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity with the topic;</li>
<li>complexity of the concept;</li>
<li>one’s mental agility;</li>
</ul>
<p>But chunks are not represented only by words on paper or screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chess players store groups of pieces together when they are asked to reproduce a chess arrangement from memory onto an empty chessboard.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Therefore, a chunk represents the position of several figures at once.</li>
<li>Solving a simple math equation like <code>8 * 3 - 42 / 2 = ?</code> requires an iterative approach to load the operands with the highest priority (8 and 3) and the operation to perform (multiplication), then solve that simple equation and store the result in the WM (24), repeat with next pair of operands (42 / 2), hold the result (21), and finally, repeat one more time, by accessing the results of the two simple operations in the WM and doing the subtraction (24 - 21) to get 3.</li>
<li>Attending a meeting requires keeping different presented ideas in mind to reason about them, make connections with one’s own thoughts, or doing tons of other stuff with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigating-the-hierarchical-structure-of-information-within-a-complex-network-of-associations">Navigating The Hierarchical Structure Of Information Within A Complex Network Of Associations</h2>
<p>You might wonder how a chunk may be represented by a single word as well as a whole book? After all, the amount of information differs immensely.</p>
<p>The idea here is how data is represented in our long-term memory and the agility of our Working Memory to combine information. The processes I have described run seamlessly and fast. When we read a sentence (not a random list of words), we expect a specific structure that we are very good at understanding. We know there is usually an action, an object, and a subject in a sentence.</p>
<p>So, when we read words, our Working Memory combines parts of the sentence into chunks and stores them in one of the four available memory slots. Then, once you are done reading a sentence, WM extracts all the relevant pieces that belong to the sentence you just read, combines them into a <em>superchunk,</em> and stores it in a single memory slot or even enter it into the long-term memory. Once you have read a paragraph, you combine several sentence superchunks into one, store it, and repeat the entire process. You thus create a hierarchy of information.</p>

<p>You can navigate it up and down. Say, you discuss the events described in the “Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring” book with …</p></div></div>

<p><code>jenv</code>&nbsp;is a tool that helps you switch between different java versions in your development machine. But, Jenv doesn't install Java for you.</p>



<p>Use your platform appropriate package manager to install&nbsp;<code>Java</code>. On macOS,&nbsp;<code>brew</code>&nbsp;is recommended.</p>



<h3>Install Java with Homebrew</h3>



<p>First, ensure that you have&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>&nbsp;installed in your system. Homebrew is a package manager for Mac OS.</p>

<p>I also posted how to install Java JDK manually in the following post.</p>

<p>Actually I already mentioned how to install Java JDK in the above post, but I will shortly show one more time</p>



<pre><code>$ brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ brew cask install adoptopenjdk</code></pre>



<pre><code>$ java --version

openjdk 14.0.1 2020-04-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7, mixed mode, sharing)</code></pre>



<p>We need to add the below function in your&nbsp;<code>~/.bashrc</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>~/.zshrc</code> so that we can switch between different Java versions.</p>



<pre><code>jdk() {
        version=$1
        export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v"$version");
        java -version
 }</code></pre>



<p>and run the following code to source</p>



<pre><code>$ source ~/.zshrc</code></pre>



<p>or</p>



<pre><code>$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>



<p>Let's install Java JDK 10</p>



<pre><code>$ brew cask install adoptopenjdk10</code></pre>



<pre><code>$ jdk 10</code></pre>



<p>That's all 🙂</p>



<h3>Installing Jenv</h3>



<h4>Linux / OS X</h4>



<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv.git ~/.jenv</code></pre>



<h4>Mac OS X via&nbsp;<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></h4>



<pre><code>$ brew install jenv</code></pre>



<h4>Bash</h4>



<pre><code>$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

<pre><code>$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
$ echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code></pre>



<p>Restart your shell by closing and reopening your terminal window.</p>



<h4>To verify&nbsp;<code>jenv</code>&nbsp;was installed</h4>



<pre><code>$ jenv doctor

[OK]	JAVA_HOME variable probably set by jenv PROMPT

In addition to a tough outer shell, brains have internal defenses, including a powerful shield called the blood-brain barrier that defends brain cells from substances in the bloodstream that are toxic and dangerous to nerve cells. If the blood-brain barrier is breached, then health problems arise.</p><p>Now, in a study with potential impacts on a variety of neurological diseases, Virginia Tech researchers have provided the first experimental evidence from a living organism to show that an abundant, star-shaped brain cell known as an astrocyte is essential for blood-brain barrier health.</p><p>The research in today’s online edition of the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1002%2Fglia.23908&amp;t=MGQ0ZTFmZTIwMTg2ODM5YjVkNGYxNzU0NDllNzUxM2MxNmY5ZTg0NSxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600935928"><i>GLIA</i></a> reassesses traditional claims about the role of astrocytes in the brain and confirms the long-held assumption — although it had been recently disputed — that astrocytes support the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Furthermore, the finding gives scientists a path to understand diseases where frequent blood-brain barrier damage occurs, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>“Blood-brain barrier leakage is a problem in the aging brain as well as many different neurological diseases,” said Stefanie Robel, an assistant professor at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffbri.vtc.vt.edu%2F&amp;t=ZTVlZDM5NmE2MmRiOTJkYTM5YWJkZmQ0ZWM0YTdiYzcwNjZlZjRhMCxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600935928">Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC</a> and the study’s senior author. “Without astrocytes, the blood-brain barrier becomes leaky and ineffective, leaving brain tissue vulnerable to a variety of medical conditions. If we know what maintains the barrier in the healthy brain, we will be able to better understand what goes wrong in traumatic brain injury and in Alzheimer’s disease — all health problems with blood-brain barrier damage.”</p><p>Generally, researchers suspect astrocytes support the blood-brain barrier by releasing factors helpful to maintaining tight connections between the cells in the barrier. </p><p>In the new study, scientists with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute genetically ablated a small number of astrocytes in adult mice to determine if the cells were necessary for blood-brain barrier health.</p><p>The researchers used small, intermediate-sized, and large molecular tracers to evaluate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. All of the markers passed through the barrier in some areas, while in other areas only small tracers leaked, suggesting that leakages were happening at various sizes. </p><p>“We now have great tools to learn about what astrocytes really do in the adult brain,” said Robel, who is also an assistant professor in Virginia Tech’s <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fneuroscience.vt.edu%2F&amp;t=MDI1NzRjYWZiNzk3MWI0YzRmZWViZjk4YmEwOGUxYTViMWVhMzRhOSxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600935928">School of Neuroscience</a>. “It’s possible that those leaks weren’t detected in previous studies.”</p><p>In recent years, contradictory studies have emerged in which scientists removed astrocytes in animal models with no indications of harm to the blood-brain barrier. </p><p>However, when Virginia Tech scientists used a mouse model to mimic the effect of the removal of astrocytes, varying degrees of permanent blood-brain barrier damage occurred, with the amount of damage possibly in proportion with the numbers of ablated astrocytes. In these scenarios, the scientists determined neighboring astrocytes do not rescue the blood-brain barrier when it is damaged.</p><p>The research began after the scientists challenged commonly accepted statements in neuroscience.</p><p>“I would read a review article that would say astrocytes maintain the blood-brain barrier in the adult healthy brain, but rarely was it followed by a citation that would show direct evidence of that fact,” said Benjamin Heithoff, the first author of the study and a graduate student who conducts research in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffbri.vtc.vt.edu%2Fresearch%2Flabs%2Frobel.html&amp;t=NmVlZmU0NmY1MDNlMWViYjQ2YjQzOTBhNjkyZjZjZjBkY2Q2ZWJmOCxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600935928">Robel lab</a> at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="749"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c316d47571b9a7301d48f0fb4d99e527/d76379001588b933-da/s1280x1920/131824229863137bb74ac5697096e322b775c0cf.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="749" width="1024" height="749"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Brain cells called astrocytes appear in green, and purple represents the leakage of the blood-brain barrier.

"Assumptions can be held for a long time, and it takes studies like ours, with more sensitive tools, to re-evaluate them. Now that we have reinforced this assumption with direct experimental data, we have positioned ourselves to identify how this vital function of astrocytes is impacted in disease and after injury.”</p><p>Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is correlated with neurodegenerative disease. In cases of traumatic brain injury or concussion, the blood-brain barrier breakdown that can occur is associated with higher risk for lifelong consequences, including cognitive decline and permanent motor deficits.</p><p>“When people sustain a concussion, we used to consider this a ‘minor injury.’ But our follow-up study shows that the blood-brain barrier leakage persists in areas where astrocytes are not functioning correctly, which suggests there is a long-term, lasting dysfunction in the barrier,” said Heithoff, who is with the Department of Biological Sciences of the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.vt.edu%2Findex.html&amp;t=ZDcyYTZhMzRhZmVlZjgxYWE4NWRlNjljODMxMDI3NjY3Zjc1ZjYwYyxRRldXZFhKcg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629877618586615808%2Fblood-brain-barrier-health&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600935928">College of Science</a>. “Understanding how that problem occurs and how it can be remedied are important public health questions.

September 21, 2020 | https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>How much should we charge for our product? What's the price model that makes sense to our users? We had a long discussion about it and we looked to consider all the important aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('1whatpricemakesourproductsustainable').scrollIntoView ()">What price makes our product sustainable?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('2isthisapriceouruserswillbewillingtopay').scrollIntoView ()">What price are users willing to pay?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('3thismodelservesourusers').scrollIntoView ()">What price model best serves our users?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('4aretheredisadvantagestothismodel').scrollIntoView ()">Are there disadvantages to this model?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these questions, we’ll be better equipped to have a solid pricing model to begin the journey of our first product: <a href="https://altocode.nl/pic/" target="_blank"> ac;pic</a>, a photo and video organization service.</p>
<p>Here's the entire process we went through.</p>
<h2 id="1whatpricemakesourproductsustainable">1. What price makes our product sustainable?</h2>
<p>There's one inescapable fact: if the product is not profitable, we can't pay ourselves and cover the costs. If that happens, there's no company, no product, no team.</p>
<p>We began with 2 straightforward questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('1howmuchdoweneedtopayourselves').scrollIntoView ()">How much do we need to pay ourselves?</a></li>
<li><a onclick="document.getElementById ('2howmuchdoesitcosttomaintaintheserviceandthecompany').scrollIntoView ()">How much does it cost to maintain the service and the company?</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="1howmuchdoweneedtopayourselves">1. How much do we need to pay ourselves?</h4>
<p>If we can't support ourselves, we can't make any of this happen. Conversely, if a project that we love and believe in can pay our salaries, it will grow and prosper with our full attention.</p>
<p>Altocode works in full transparency, which means everybody can see everything we <a href="https://github.com/altocodenl" target="_blank">do,</a> we <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1otweqrARCHe2u6DeHW3FDZmug0L1Wd6p" target="_blank">think,</a> and how much we earn. The market shall know our salaries.</p>
<p>We set salary milestones for different stages of the product. You can see them <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNd62OXI3dduxodI-9dBOUoxnAczPgm2yIk-jFFR6T4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Our first milestone will enable us to work full-time in Altocode. That's a salary of €3,000 a month after tax, per founder. That's around US $3,500 after tax. We're a 2-person team, so that's €6,000 after tax a month.</p>
<p>The next question is 'how many paying users do we need to make €6,000 a month after tax?'</p>
<p>We built a simple table that takes into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net income per user: how much should the company earn from each paying user after taxes and costs.</li>
<li>Net salary per founder: monthly salary after tax per founder.</li>
<li>Amount of monthly paying users: amount of paying users needed for each net income and net salary.</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNd62OXI3dduxodI-9dBOUoxnAczPgm2yIk-jFFR6T4/edit#gid=0"><img loading="lazy" src="https://altocode.nl/blog/img/monthly%20paying%20users%20required.png" alt="ac;pic monthly paying users required"></a></p>
<p>For each column of 'net income per user' we have the amount of paying users necessary to reach €3,000 of net monthly salary per founder.</p>
<p>The next question is, 'what should be the target amount of users for the first milestone?'</p>
<p>It can't be very high, otherwise it might take too long to get there and - as a fully bootstrapped company - we only have so much runway. On the other hand, we can't go for a very low number of paying users, because prices might get too high (we haven't added operating costs and taxes yet) and prevent people from becoming paying users.</p>
<p>In the spirit of <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">Kevin Kelly's '1,000 true fans' article,</a> we feel that around 1,500 to 2,000 paying users should allow us to reach our first milestone. If we can't get that amount of paying users in a few months, we have bigger issues than pricing. Still, we needed to continue our analysis to get to a price.</p>
<h4 id="2howmuchdoesitcosttomaintaintheserviceandthecompany">2. How much does it cost to maintain the service and the company?</h4>
<p>This is where most companies make mistakes and later on experience a rude awakening. If we don't understand our costs well, our pricing could be way off (either too cheap or too expensive).</p>
<p>What things do we need to account for besides our net salaries?
a. Income taxes on our salaries.
b. Infrastructure costs.
c. Product-related services: design, security.
d. Business-related services: accountants, lawyers, banking.
e. Working capital.
f. Value Added Tax.
g. Credit card processing and payments.</p>
<p>Let's go through each of these points in more detail.</p>
<p>a. Income taxes on our salaries:
Altocode is based in The Netherlands (this is mainly for 2 reasons: one of the founders lives there, and the EU is a great place to start a company to steward users' data). Income taxes in The Netherlands are anywhere between 30 and 50%, depending on the tax bracket. 40% is a realistic estimation for the first stage of the business.</p>
<p>b. Infrastructure costs:
Our service is fully based on the cloud and our main providers are <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" target="_blank">Hetzner</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon AWS.</a> There's a very small fixed component to this (hosting, email), but most of this cost is proportional to the amount of space used by our users. This cost will be divided in two parts: that corresponding to free accounts (which will be covered by the company) and that to paid accounts (which is paid by the users themselves as a variable cost; <a onclick="document.getElementById ('whataboutthestorage').scrollIntoView ()">see below</a>).</p>
<p>c. Product-related services: design, security:
Neither of us is a designer or a security expert. Those skills (among others) are crucial to further develop a world-class product. We will be very happy to develop close relationships with design and security experts in the future, hence we need to account for them.</p>
<p>d. Business-related services: accountants, lawyers, banking:
We have a basic company set up, but we will definitely need to invest in accountants &amp; lawyers to set up a larger company structure as soon as we scale to thousands of users. Same goes for upgrading our type of bank account, as well as opening additional accounts for salaries, setting up processes to deal with invoices, etc. While these costs are somewhat fixed, it is reasonable to consider that they will grow based on the size of the business, but we expect that growth to be less than proportional.</p>
<p>e. Working capital:
Any company, and particularly a bootstrapped startup, needs to have working capital (ie: extra money in the bank) in order to grow and withstand crises. Although <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-how" target="_blank">we're not a profit-maximizing company</a> (in short: we cannot sell the company, we cannot get rich from the company and, as we grow in paid accounts, we'll reduce the price per user), we need to be smart and have enough working capital to invest in the company's growth or cover any hiccups that might happen along the way. You either plan this ahead and have a good chance of overcoming most problems or deal with it later in a do-or-die situation. We rather have the former than the latter, for our own sake and our users' sake.</p>
<p>So, how do we take into account the infrastructure cost, product-related services, business-related services and working capital? <strong>We set a cost budget per paying user</strong>. Since all these costs are positively correlated to the size of the business, we can infer that the more users we have - especially in the beginning - the more costs we'll have to account for. Of course, these won't be linear, but in the early stages these costs can add up quickly and halt growth. As we grow we'll have to review this cost item, but now we have to ensure a solid service and business survival.</p>
<p>We concluded that these items combined add €2 per paying user.</p>
<p>An heuristic way to think about this is the following: if we have 100 paying users, it is reasonable to have about €200 of monthly expenses; at 1,000 paying users, it is reasonable to have a budget of €2,000.</p>
<p>f. Value Added Tax:
We have to make a differentiation here.</p>
<ul>
<li>For our European Union paying users, Value Added Tax must be added to the price. A 21% uptick. Nothing to do here.</li>
<li>For our non-European Union users, great news. No Value Added Tax. No changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>g. Credit card processing and payments:
We'll use Stripe. It's easy to use, reliable, and has great international coverage.</p>
<p>From Stripe we'll use 2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stripe Payments to collect payments.</li>
<li>Stripe Billing to set recurring payments for our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>For The Netherlands, the pricing is a little different than for the United States (you can check it out <a href="https://stripe.com/en-nl/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>These are the Stripe fees. Stripe calculates the fees over the final price (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_Cxl77xqC0xbqdqrOA17CbvBs3GNCjmrROcuVR4Ox0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">after tax</a>). Now it gets a little tricky.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://altocode.nl/blog/img/stripe%20fees.png" alt="stripe fees for The Netherlands"></p>
<p>On top of the Value Added Tax (VAT) differentiation between European and non-European users, Stripe charges us differently when processing a European card, vs a non-European card. That needs to be taken into consideration in the price.</p>
<p>Lastly, we decided that <strong>we'll only bill in euros</strong>. Our wages are in euros, our costs are in euros, as well as taxes. Having other currencies would complicate things for no good reason.</p>
<h4 id="thepricecalculation">The price calculation</h4>
<p>With all this information we built another table, and built the price from the net income per user, adding all the costs and taxes. We built the price from the bottom up.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNd62OXI3dduxodI-9dBOUoxnAczPgm2yIk-jFFR6T4/edit#gid=0"><img loading="lazy" src="https://altocode.nl/blog/img/fixed%20price%20calculation.png" alt="ac;pic Fixed price calculation"></a></p>
<p>You'll note that in the costs line (those €2 per user) we affected half of it with Value Added Tax (VAT). We're estimating that half of our costs will be affected by VAT, so only €1 of the cost per user will incur VAT.</p>
<p>An interesting observation (that took us a while to figure out) is that we should charge an extra amount to non-European users for the VAT incurred by those €2 per user. These services accrue VAT, but because we don't have to pay VAT for non-European users, we cannot use their payment to offset the VAT incurred by those services. Hence, we need to charge them extra to keep things fair between European and non-European users. In addition to this, this fairness ensures that both European and non-European users will be equally profitable to us.</p>
<p>Previously, we had circled between 1,500 and 2,000 paying users to reach our initial goal. That meant a net income per user between €3 and €4. With the numbers more clear, we concluded that our best choice is to go with €3 of net income per user.</p>
<p>The fixed part of ac;pic's price will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>€9 a month for European Union users.</li>
<li>€7.50 for non-European Union users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We need 2,000 monthly paying users to reach the first milestone.</strong></p>
<h4 id="whataboutthestorage">What about the storage?</h4>
<p>If you followed the cost breakdown you might have noticed that we haven't considered the storage cost for the paid accounts. We accounted for servers to keep the service up &amp; running and the storage cost for free accounts, but the bulk of the cost for a photo and video organization service comes from storage.</p>
<p>The cost we have as of today is €0.05 per GB. <strong>We won't make any profit from storage cost. ac;pic's users will pay storage at cost.</strong> If it's cheaper for us, it will be cheaper for our users.</p>
<p>This cost would incur VAT, but since the underlying server costs also pay VAT at the same rate, the VATs cancel each other out. That, however, assumes that …</p></div>

And ultimately, what defines a product.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is because planning answers the questions of <em>why</em>, then moves on to what, which then brings forth how and when.&nbsp;All the fundamental questions get asked sequentially, like a domino sequence, but not before the <em>why</em> is asked, the why comes first.</p><p>UX Planning does this best when the process is started off in the right way. Just as a building holds firmly and is best built when it’s beginnings are underpinned by a firm foundation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But what is the foundation of a good plan?</strong></p><p>It is <em>Information Architecture</em>.</p><p>The thread that runs through the entire design process.</p><h3>What Is Information Architecture?</h3><p>When we talk about information architecture, we are literally talking about the fundamentals of what underpins a design. Design is, in essence, the organization of information, so that it may best be used for whatever purpose its organized product has. This organization happens according to logical principles, but it is done in an intuitive way, based on experience.</p><p>Information architecture then, is the description of how we organize that information.</p><p><strong>Creating Information Architecture is the art of organizing and structuring content in a logical and user-friendly way that allows the user to easily meet their goal.</strong></p><p>In other words, Information Architecture is the general map of your project that your user will navigate through to ultimately succeed in accomplishing their goal.</p><p>Within the context of UI layout design, the Information Architecture forms the basis of the plan going forward. It tells you about everything that is going to be happening next, as well as, by its very nature, gives you hints of how to progress. In the same way that, as we’ve mentioned earlier, a book’s contents pages form your overall impression and map of the book.&nbsp;</p><p>We judge Amazon books by their contents pages. Which is why that is mostly what is available to preview in their books via their ‘Look Inside’ feature.</p><p>Maybe they know something about Information Architecture and UX Planning that we don’t?</p></div></div>]]>

<h3><span>8. Game characters</span></h3>

<p>Nothing makes us more engaged into a game than game characters. Augmented reality filters can turn a player into their favorite characters who appeal to their traits. Or we may associate ourselves with characters based on their appearance. You can design high quality Unity 3D masks with rich graphics that transfer some of distinctive hero traits or replicate their in-game looks from head to toe.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>9. Face paint</span></h3>
<img src="https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=600&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif" alt="face mesh mask unity filter" width="600" srcset="https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=300&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 300w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=600&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 600w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=900&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 900w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=1200&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 1200w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=1500&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 1500w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif?width=1800&amp;name=face%20mesh%20mask%20unity%20filter.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<p>Unity filters can cover a part of the face or overlay a full-face mesh mask allowing users to maintain privacy in the game video chat. A 3D mask precisely fits the face while still allowing players to show emotions and stay human without revealing their identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>10. Mixed looks</span></h3>
<img src="https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=600&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif" alt="mixed look unity 3d mask" width="600" srcset="https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=300&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 300w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=600&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 600w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=900&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 900w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=1200&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 1200w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=1500&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 1500w, https://www.banuba.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif?width=1800&amp;name=mixed%20look%20unity%203d%20mask.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">

<p>Over the course of this two-part series, I want to explore when and how you should hire junior engineers. At its core, the interview process needs to be based on the same guiding principle: look for strengths, not weaknesses. It’s just the strengths of a junior candidate are very different from those of a senior candidate.</p>

<p>In this first part, let’s explore when you would even want to hire junior candidates. What kind of team should you be trying to build?</p>

<h2 id="the-experience-potential-trade-off">The experience-potential trade-off</h2>

<p>A junior engineer doesn’t have much experience, but they typically have a vested interest in proving themselves. That results in a “get-it-done” attitude and out-of the box thinking. They are also more malleable to the company culture, so they are easier to integrate with an existing team, even as they bring in new ideas. It makes sense to bring in junior engineers to ensure the team is constantly evolving.</p>

<p>But, the flip side is the lack of experience leads to more mistakes and the inability to think long-term. A great senior engineer can craft an architecture that is easy to experiment with and sticks around for a long time. A junior engineer can solve the current problem, but each subsequent feature becomes harder to add.</p>

<h2 id="support-structures">Support structures</h2>

<p>If you’re at the earliest stages of building your company, you may be able to get away with hiring only junior engineers. After all, you need someone who can solve problems in any way possible, because you’re working on product-market fit. Later, when you have paying customers, you can hire a senior engineer to build a long-lasting architecture.</p>

<p>But even then, a senior engineer can put into place an architecture that’s easy to experiment on. Maybe that architecture doesn’t have extensive automated tests or the latest technologies, but those decisions were made deliberately to meet the needs of the company. So, if you’re building a team, consider the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Generally prefer to start off your team with a few solid senior engineers. These engineers will build both an engineering culture and a technical foundation that can be iterated upon by others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only then bring in junior engineers to evolve the team. With a strong foundation in place, the senior engineers can focus on mentoring the new hires, and the new hires can bring in their unique perspective.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s no exact ratio of senior to junior engineers that’s optimal, but try to have a healthy mix. Without the support structure provided by senior engineers, both types of engineers will feel frustrated.</p>

<h2 id="pay-discrepancies">Pay discrepancies</h2>

<p>Notice I haven’t talked about pay. Obviously, junior engineers cost less in compensation, but that’s because you’re paying for different skill sets. If you need someone to build an engineering culture, a lower-paid junior engineer can’t do the job. If you’re looking for someone to pump out code, an architect is not the right fit.</p>

<p>So don’t consider these different roles as interchangeable. You won’t save money this way.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hiring junior engineers is a great idea, <em>provided you have the right support structure to help them succeed</em>. Typically, this means hiring some solid senior engineers to lay the foundation, then later provide mentorship to new hires. Thinking this way allows you to hire the right individuals at the right time.</p>

                        <p>A campaigner says much of the world’s online advertising industry doesn’t comply with Europe’s privacy rules.</p>

							<p>Google and several data brokers are violating the EU's privacy rules by harvesting people's personal information to build highly detailed online profiles, including some firms' collection of information on sexual orientation, health status and religious beliefs, <a href="https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JohnnyRyanDocumnet.pdf">according to a report</a> published on Monday.</p>
<p>The accusations — from Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, an NGO — come 18 months after Ireland's privacy regulator began a probe into how Google collects and shares people's online information for its advertising business.</p>
<p>Several other European data protection authorities subsequently received separate complaints into so-called real-time bidding (RTB), a system by which advertisers use data to target people with paid-for messages when they surf the web.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry, including Google, says it has bolstered privacy protections since the European Union started enforcing its updated rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, more than two years ago.</p>
<p>But Ryan, who filed a complaint with the Irish privacy regulator about these data practices in September 2018, said that little has changed since the new rules came online two years ago.</p>
<p>He called on Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) to act swiftly to clamp down on what he believes were wide-scale breaches of people's online privacy, including the use of online profiles to target individuals around sensitive topics like whether they have AIDS, and to influence voters during elections.</p>
<p>Ryan said the real-time bidding system, which broadcasted web users' online behavior and habits to multiple advertising companies and data brokers, infringed on the region's privacy rules that required data to be kept secure and used proportionately.</p>
<p>"The [Irish Data Protection] Commission has failed to stop that ongoing biggest data breach in history and as a consequence people across Europe and in Ireland are exposed to intimate profiling including of health conditions and political views and location over time, because the RTB system leaks that data into the data broker market," he told POLITICO in reference to Ireland's privacy regulator.</p>
<h3>Spotlight on Dublin</h3>
<p>Because Dublin is home to many of the world's largest tech companies like Google and Facebook, it has the responsibility to oversee how they comply with Europe's privacy standards.</p>
<p>Under the region's data protection rules, sensitive data, including information about a person's health status, sexual orientation or religious beliefs, must be handled more carefully than other information, and companies have to explicitly ask individuals if such information can be collected about them.</p>
<p>"The question for Ireland and the Irish government that must be answered is whether DPC is capable of advancing critical urgent investigations of this nature," he added. "Does it have adequate resources, including technical and procedural competence to discharge its tasks?"</p>
<p>In response, Ireland's privacy agency said that it had met with Ryan to discuss his concerns and that work on its Google investigation continues. The watchdog also has a separate ongoing probe into the data practices of Quantcast, a major online advertising firm, though it has yet to bring an enforcement action or fine against any non-Irish company or organization under Europe's privacy rules.</p>
<p>"The investigation has progressed and a full update on the next steps [was] provided to the concerned party," said Graham Doyle, deputy commissioner at Ireland's privacy agency, in reference to Ryan's complaint about how Google and others collect and use people's data. He declined to comment on what the next steps would be or when a decision would be taken in the investigation into the search giant.</p>
<p>Google said that it also has safeguards in place to protect people's personal data, including in its real-time bidding network.</p>
<p>"We do not allow advertisers to select ads based on sensitive personal data and we do not share people’s sensitive personal data, browsing histories or profiles with advertisers," Alex McPhillips, a Google spokesman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In his report, Ryan outlines what he says are ongoing privacy failures by many of the world's largest online advertising firms and data brokers linked to the global real-time bidding industry.</p>
<p>That includes OnAudience, a data broker, that holds data on people in almost every country on the planet, according to its website.</p>
<p>It used that information,&nbsp;for instance, to target 1.4 million people who supported gay rights during last year's Polish parliamentary election, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7xo77grl2mnb6b6/AAAlszXoQ_zM2kUSsSRqKJSqa?dl=0&amp;preview=4.+Evidence+of+election+interference+in+Poland+(Appendix+A).pdf" target="_blank">based on&nbsp;a company presentation</a>. To do that, OnAudience created online profiles of people based on whether they had read, watched or searched for content associated with LGBTQ rights ahead of the vote, and used that data for a get-out-the-vote campaign for a local group.</p>
<p>The company also uses its database to allow clients to target people who have displayed an interest in other sensitive data topics such as AIDS and HIV, diabetes, incest and abuse support. Such information is considered sensitive and must be handled with additional care under Europe's privacy rules.</p>
<p>An OnAudience representative said the company does not process any personal data, or information about sexual orientation. “Our data is only based on online behavior and visited content. The campaign mentioned [in Ryan’s research] was not conducted by a political party, but by a social organization that promotes equality.”</p>
<p>"The most intimate thing about anyone that you can buy is their health data because this dictates their life expectancy, their ability to pay their mortgage, the risk of giving them health insurance and potentially influences decisions about whether to employ them," Ryan said.</p>

<p>I always loved getting problems of the type “What is the limit as x approaches infinity” type in high-school/college. You’re given an equation (of the classic y=x format), and asked to derive what the value of y will be as x grows to infinity.</p>



<p>One thing you learn pretty quickly about these types of problems is that often it doesn’t matter where the function “starts” (or where it is at small values of x). It could start at zero, or at negative infinity, but its limit might be infinity, and vice versa (it could start large but have a limit of zero or negative infinity).</p>



<p>In fact, for many equations, there’s usually one <strong>dominant term</strong>. This is the term that dominates the limit. There might be countless other factors or parts of the equation that matter initially, but eventually it’s that dominant term that wins. This is sometimes known as the <strong>dominant term rule</strong>. We’ll get back to this in a second.</p>



<h3>Ads vs. Search</h3>



<p>Google had a little press kerfuffle a few months ago. You can read a summary in the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/technology/google-search-results.html">here</a>, but the short of it is that the company launched a design change that made search results and ads look very similar. Presumably, this increased revenue for Google, since many people ignore ads when they can easily identify them, the same way you’d ignore stepping in dog crap if you can identify it in the mud (and yes, given the state of online ads and content I pick this analogy deliberately). But there was a pretty strong backlash against this as a “dark pattern” designed to trick users. After the negative press, Google walked back the change.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following the news around big tech companies these past couple of years, this type of behavior is not surprising at all. These companies have grown really large, are arguably monopolistic, and hyper-focused on growth and revenue. Over and over, they have made decisions that have resulted in backlash from the press and from their users.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if I ignore the past ten years, and jump back to when I worked at Google as an entry-level Software Engineer, it is a <em>little</em> surprising to me. I worked at Google from 2006-2009. At the time, it was already a rapidly-growing public company (I think I joined when there were around 8,000 employees, and left when there were 20,000). I initially worked on the team responsible for AdWords, so I had some exposure to the culture and decisions that were made at the time (of course it wasn’t <em>deep</em> exposure, since I was an entry-level Software Engineer on the lowest rung of the ladder… but it was exposure nonetheless).</p>



<p><em>Note: I’m going to pick on Google a little bit here, but I do love that company. I think there’s a lot it can improve on, but it’s still one of my favorite and least “evil” large tech company. I chose them simply because I’m more familiar with them.</em></p>



<p>At the time, Google employees might have argued against making a change because it was “evil”. The “don’t be evil” motto was still around, and as engineers who were building parts of the product and making decisions, we were pretty ideological about it. One of the company’s values was also to put users first, employees second, and shareholders third. By any of these lenses, the type of design change that Google got flak for recently would have been highly unlikely at the time.</p>



<h3>Revenue is the Dominant Term</h3>



<p>Let’s take a dominant term view of this problem. When a company is first built, several variables dictate its decisions:</p>



<ul><li>The <em>implicit </em>values/culture of the early team. As Ben Horowitz would say, “what you do is who you are.”&nbsp;</li><li>The <em>explicit </em>values/culture of the early team. Are we user-centric? Data-driven? …</li><li>The revenue model.</li></ul>



<p>I think that over time, the revenue model is the dominant term. The limit of a product towards infinity, so to speak, is based on its revenue model. If your revenue model is ads, it doesn’t matter if your stated mission is “to organize the world’s knowledge and make it universally accessible and useful”, “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”, or anything else. If your revenue model is ads, you are an ads company.</p>



<p>I’m not diminishing the role of culture and values. I think those are critical. Part of me would love to believe the hundreds of books written on how culture determines everything. But I don’t. At least not for companies that can hire some of the smartest people in the world, gather massive amounts of data, and build technology more sophisticated than ever. And be trying to “maximize shareholder value”.</p>



<p>I’ve actually agonized over whether culture or revenue are the dominant term. In fact, I agonized so much that I’ve had this article in my head for years, and in a Google Doc for months, but I couldn’t get myself to write it / publish it. Because part of me believes culture always wins. Actually, <em>all</em> of me <em>wants </em>to believe culture <em>always</em> wins. But I’ve had my idealism crushed enough times by hard realities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, having and espousing a positive culture and set of values are important. And they may shape how and how quickly the revenue model dominates (for example, companies like Enron or pre-IPO Uber show how bad things can get if you have a terrible culture). But regardless of your mission statement, your culture, your values, and so on, if you choose the wrong revenue model, it will dominate them in a shareholder-value-driven, capitalistic society. Culture can only dominate if it’s negative. A positive culture <em>is </em>necessary, but it’s not sufficient.</p>



<p><em>In other words, over the long term, a company (and its product) will morph to take the shape of its revenue streams.</em></p>



<h3>Charlie Munger Knew It</h3>



<p>Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet’s business partner, has a pretty famous speech where he talks about the power of incentives.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Well I think I’ve been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I’ve underestimated it. And never a year passes, but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther.” —<a href="https://fs.blog/2013/02/the-psychology-of-human-misjudgement/">Charlie Munger</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Charlie gives several examples: for instance, FedEx needed to move/sort their packages more quickly, so instead of paying employees per hour, they paid them per shift: productivity increased dramatically (employees now had less incentive to take longer hours to do the same amount of work). Charlie’s model of human behavior is pretty simple: we follow incentives. He makes people sound almost coin-operated.</p>



<p>Now, this isn’t entirely true—there are plenty of examples and research showing that our behavior is more complicated than simple incentives would predict. But Charlie is arguably one of the best investors in the world, and he’s onto something. Even though there might be other variables that influence our behavior, you can still simplify things down to incentives. Incentives are his dominant term.</p>



<p>That incentives are dominant is actually pretty obvious to a lot of people. Somehow in the tech industry, we seem to have just clouded our own judgement through some sense of moral superiority. We care about the impact we’re having on the world. We have noble missions that we rally around and try to hire people who are excited by them. So far, so good. But then we shoot ourselves in the foot by setting up business models with misaligned incentives.</p>



<h3>Look for Aligned Business Models</h3>



<p>So what does this mean in practice? Well, if you only care about making money, it doesn’t mean much. But if you do care about more than money, if you care about the impact your work has and you want to be proud of what you do, it’s worth thinking through this a little more deeply.</p>



<p>Whether you’re starting a company or joining one, look for a business model <em>without</em> perverse incentives. A business model that sets things up so that the better a product is, the better off the company is and its users are.</p>



<p>Sometimes, counterintuitively, a business model may seem aligned at first glance, but end up being quite harmful. The classic example that we’re all now aware of is free products. Free seems great at first glance. But companies have to make money somehow. So they sell ads, or data, or some mix of the two that their users don’t quite understand. And so now, success for the company means more time spent on the product (which may or may not be a good thing for users), less privacy (definitely not a good thing for users), and ultimately more ads.*</p>



<p>So often, paid is better than free*.  At <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a>, my current startup, we’ve chosen to go with a paid model, with a hope that we’ll be more aligned in creating value for our users (who we can now call customers… notice how there’s a word for “customer service”, but no “user service”?). There will still be plenty of forks in the road where we can decide whether we help our customers, or take advantage of them, and I hope our values will help us navigate those forks, but at least the revenue model is in our favor.</p>



<p>Another layer to consider is whether your product and revenue model help people with just short-term goals, or a mix of both short and long-term goals. Products that are great and helpful, help their users with both. Good products might help with one or the other. The products with the most potential for damage provide some short-term benefit at the <em>expense</em> of longer-term goals.</p>



<p>So when you consider starting or joining a company, look at the business model, and do the “limit math”. Think about what things might look like if you become massively successful, because you might be.</p>

				<p>Today is a good day for our climate and planet. Smart ecosystem restoration plays a key role in our global effort to minimise climate change and accelerate the transformation to a low carbon economy. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to automate ecosystem restoration by bringing together plant science, AI, drones and human creativity to decrease the costs and increase the accountability of biological carbon sequestration. Our <a href="https://ecosummit.net/articles/ecosummit-invests-in-clim8-dendra-systems-and-solar-for-schools">angel portfolio</a> company <a href="https://www.dendra.io/">Dendra Systems</a> raises $10M (€8.4M) Series A from <a href="https://airbusventures.vc/">Airbus Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.atoneventures.com/">At One Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.futurepositivecapital.com/">Future Positive Capital</a> and <a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">Lowercarbon Capital</a>. Nicole Conner (Airbus Ventures) and Tom Chi (At One Ventures) join the board to support CEO and Co-Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susangraham123/">Susan Graham</a> and her diverse team of ecologists and technologists in building a big startup with big impact.</p>
<p><img src="http://ecosummit.net/uploads/dendra_series_a_photo_620.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>Oxford-based Dendra was founded in 2014 with the simple idea to plant trees with drones. It took the founders a while to find product-market fit by pivoting the smart green startup to paying customers, in Dendra’s case the mining industry in Australia. It turns out that natural resources companies exploiting metals, minerals, coal, oil and gas nowadays take sustainability very seriously and have adopted comprehensive sustainability strategies. They often hire service providers to help them restore and rehabilitate land that was degraded during mining operations. In fact, in most countries there are laws that demand ex-post ecosystem restoration. Driven by customers including <a href="https://www.bhp.com/">BHP</a>, <a href="https://www.glencore.com/">Glencore</a>, <a href="https://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> and <a href="https://www.yancoal.com.au/">Yancoal</a> Dendra developed an end-to-end solution including machine learning and aerial seeding for scalable ecosystem restoration and already carried out 38 projects in 11 countries. The new funds will be used to hire new talent, further develop the product and enter new markets and industries.</p>
<p><img src="http://ecosummit.net/uploads/dendra_drone_620.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>Dendra’s patented technology captures high resolution data and applies ecology-trained artificial intelligence to map and assess degraded land. Leveraging this data, precise restoration plans for every site’s unique ecological conditions are created and executed. Utilising customised drones, Dendra is able to plant 120 seeds a minute per drone at scale — 150 times faster than traditional manual planting methods. Afterwards, Dendra continues to collect data and analyse plant growth to predict where future work will be needed, ensure full restoration and quantify carbon capture without the costs or risks of putting human workers into the field.</p>
<p><img src="http://ecosummit.net/uploads/dendra_ecologists_technologists_620.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>We’re very happy and proud to be among Dendra’s smart green investors and believe that this startup is going to make a big difference for our future. Get in touch with Susan and her team if you want to invest in their next round to generate environmental, financial and strategic returns, work for Dendra to change the world yourself or become a customer to automate your sustainability. The time to act is now.</p>

<p>A large property map hangs in the mayor's office, right next to a display cabinet full of memorabilia accumulated over a long term in office. The coat of arms of the town of Grünheide on the map has faded, as has the writing: "Net settlement area of 300 hectares," it reads, if you look hard enough.</p>


<div>
<p>Arne Christiani's predecessor hung up the poster 20 years ago, back when BMW wanted to build a car manufacturing plant on the site, but then chose the city of Leipzig instead. "When I was first elected mayor in 2003, I left the map up," says Christiani. The pine forest on the edge of the town has remained his field of dreams for almost 17 years.</p><p>During that time, Grünheide has grown steadily, but its population has also aged. It's a place that's beautiful for people who appreciate peace and quiet, but not one that’s particularly tempting for the younger generation. Each year, Christiani has apologized to locals on International Volunteer Day for the fact that it had once again not been possible to attract high-quality industrial jobs to the area.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>For some time now, though, two new maps have been hanging above the old one, with the parcel of land colored red. Christiani's dream could finally be coming true, with Tesla hoping to build electric cars on the site.</p><h3><strong>Dreams Threatened, Dreams Come True</strong></h3><p>If you leave Town Hall and walk a good 800 meters through a pine forest to the edge of the village, you reach a lake called Peetzsee. Christiani had been in office for two years when Johannes Curth and his family came to fulfil their dream here, swapping a rental apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood for a home of their own, surrounded by forests and lakes.</p>
</div>

<p>The Curths bought a plot of land just a few meters from the shore of the lake back when prices were still reasonable. They built a house with large windows and surrounded by a good-sized yard, in which stand two magnificent old trees in it.</p>

<p>But now that Mayor Christiani's dream is coming true, Curth sees his own dream threatened. "We moved here because of the peace and quiet and the nature," he says. "What will happen if Tesla starts building cars here?" He fears for the quality of the water and air. And he worries about the extra traffic and what will happen to this sleepy community of 8,755 people when Tesla moves in.</p>

<div>
<p>Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind the carmaker, is an uncompromising man whose ideas jump back and forth between California, Mars and Grünheide. The head of the world's largest electric car manufacturer builds rockets that ferry people into space and dreams of building a hyperloop tunnel for passenger transport. He is adored by his followers because, as an entrepreneur, he refuses to accept any limits.</p><h3><strong>Breathtaking Speed</strong></h3><p>Almost as a byproduct, Musk is now also changing not only the provincial state of Brandenburg, where he’s setting up his factory, but also Germany. The project just outside of Berlin is becoming symbolic for industrial policy in times of climate change. Whereas German companies tend to moan and dig in their heels when the government sets overly ambitious climate targets, as they did last week when the new European Union climate goals were announced, Tesla brings both together: sustainable manufacturing and speed. Breathtaking speed.</p>

<p>Musk's Gigafactory will be built in a region where most structures tend to be single-family homes, if there are any at all. In the first stage of development, 12,000 people will work around the clock in three shifts. Once the factory is complete, more than 40,000 people could produce a good 2 million Tesla vehicles here. "Please work at Tesla Giga Berlin! It's going to be a ton of fun," Musk recently tweeted in German.</p><p>For quite some time, German car executives and politicians tended to make fun of Musk, notorious as he was for his outrageous personality on Twitter. When he outlined his visions at a 2014 lunch with Peter Altmaier - who was chief of staff of Angela Merkel's Chancellery at the time but is now economics minister – and raved about the advantages of electric propulsion, saying it could be used in all means of transportation except for rockets flying into space, Altmaier still thought he sounded a bit unhinged. "At the time," says Altmaier, "nobody thought this technology would be so successful." At least the German competition didn't.</p><p>As recently as 2018, when the California-based company was having troubles with the serial production of its Model 3, Volkswagen considered becoming a strategic investor in Tesla to teach Musk how to do mass production. But reality has long since overtaken that idea: Tesla is now worth five times as much as Volkswagen on the stock exchange.</p><p>The days when the billionaire had to ask politicians for an appointment are over. When he came to Germany in early September to visit his construction site, the reception he received was that of a pop star. Fans shared the latest movement data of his private jet and puzzled where he might pop up next. Leading politicians cleared their calendars at short notice.</p><p>This week, the Musk party is set to continue, and his name will once again appear in newspapers around the world. He has slated this Tuesday as "Battery Day,” when he plans to announce the progress Tesla has made in battery technology in addition to identifying the site of at least one new battery plant. There are many indications, including interviews with Musk, that Grünheide may be chosen as the site. If it is, giant tree-felling machines would again show up to wait for authorization to clear another 60 hectares (nearly 150 acres) of forest.</p><p>It would send an unmistakable message. Because one day later, on Wednesday, hearings are set to begin in the nearby town of Erkner on the 406 complaints against the factory that have been filed by environmental associations and residents. Construction, though, has already been underway for months, with Tesla deciding to move ahead at its own risk with preliminary permits.</p><h3><strong>Faster and Better</strong></h3><p>A recent visit to the construction site in Grünheide provided a glimpse of the degree to which Tesla's mantra has been internalized at Tesla, a mantra by which speed counts most. Evan Horetsky, who heads the roughly 100-member Tesla team in Grünheide, showed a number of interested journalists around the construction site.</p><p>The slim man in his mid-30s with a shaved head and carefully trimmed beard is one of the troubleshooters on Musk's team. He helped out with the Tesla factory in California before going to Reno, Nevada, to lead the creation of the company's first Gigafactory. That had hardly been finished by the time construction in Shanghai began. He says that he and his people have gotten "faster and better" each time. Now, Horetsky is moving things along in Brandenburg.</p><p>Just last fall, the site was covered with tall pine trees. Now, though, they have been replaced by dozens of white concrete pillars protruding from the levelled ground. In the rear section, the shell of the paint shop has been erected. "We gained experience during the construction of the first buildings that we could directly apply in the further development of the design," the American says. "It enabled us to save a couple of days."</p>

<p>The fact that final permission to build the factory has not yet been granted and that skeptical citizens must first be heard doesn't bother Horetsky. He says he takes their fears seriously. He notes that similarly complicated requirements had to be fulfilled when building the factory in Shanghai. "The difference to Germany is that here, the people who are directly affected can have their say," says Horetsky. "And who has more of a right to air their views than they do?"</p><p>It is, essentially, the concrete realization of what had been an abstract discussion. What price is society prepared to pay for the future? And are Germans capable of keeping up with the necessary pace?</p><p>The Gigafactory is set to be built in record time, with the first Y model electric SUVs slated for shipping as early as summer 2021. Plans call for 500,000 electric cars to be produced annually by the end of the first construction stage, a pace the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has described as "breakneck."</p><p>And all this is taking place in Germany, a country where the length of approval procedures has almost doubled in the last 10 years. And in the state of Brandenburg, where construction of the Berlin-Brandenburg Airport (BER) has been marred by endless construction problems and is finally set to open its doors, fully nine years behind schedule.</p><h3><strong>Not Even Corona Has Slowed the Project</strong></h3><p>It sounded almost like a joke initially: An American high-tech car company with a volatile boss meets German environmental law, citizen participation and German bureaucracy. Now, though, it looks as though electric cars could start rolling off the assembly line in Grünheide even faster than they did in centrally steered China. And not even the coronavirus has thus far managed to slow down the project.</p><p>Somehow, the clichés didn't hold true. Tesla may be a tenacious, demanding company, but it also takes criticism seriously and tries to address it. In contrast to German companies, Musk uses every possibility that planning law avails him to accelerate construction, but he does so at his own risk. At the same time, the Brandenburg government has shown itself to be a skilful negotiator in the fight for the project. Since the contract was awarded, a task force of employees from the participating authorities has met weekly with Tesla representatives to discuss progress on the project.</p><p>Axel Vogel was one of the founding members of the Green Party in 1980.

How about the number of dreaded parentheses, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>?

</table>

<p>
As we can see from the table, on every punctuation metric that I could think
of, Deep Diamond and Clojure fare better than Keras &amp; Python.
</p>

<p>
Keras uses almost twice as much parentheses than Deep Diamond. Clojure uses <code>[]</code>
for vector literals, which Deep Diamond uses as tensor shapes. You will note that
there are more than a few of these, and argue that these are parentheses, too.
Fine. Add them up, and Clojure fares slightly better than Python!
</p>

<p>
A parenthesis here and there is not a problem, but there are horror tales of
<code>(((((((</code> and <code>)))))))</code> in Lisps. Not in Clojure. See that there is not a
single <code>((</code> in the Clojure example, and only two occurances of <code>))</code>.
In Python - there are 8.
</p>

<p>
Then we come to all additional assorted punctuation in Python: commas, dots, etc.
In Clojure, there are none, while in Python there are dozens.
</p>

<p>
Python is also riddled with redundant stuff such as <code>model.add()</code>.
</p>

<p>
Etc., etc. You get my point.

<p>Most Sundays, Somia Hamdan visits her local park with her two friends, Amal and Laima. They sit on a picnic bench opposite one another and chat neurotically about Twitter and local gossip. Hamdan is there to socialize but also to supervise. “Since I created the space,” Hamdan said, “I like to take care of it.”</p>



<p>At 23, living in Gaza, Hamdan has been blighted by three brutal conflicts with Israel, decades of protests, a cycle of rocket fire between Israel and Gaza’s rulers, Hamas, and infighting between Palestinian factions. She faces one of the <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/gaza-strip">worst employment rates</a> in the world, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/activity/education-gaza-strip">oversubscribed schools</a>, and a territory in which movement is tightly controlled and more than half the population <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-23.7154.h&amp;p=11132">lives on less than $5.50 per day.</a> Live concerts and movie theaters are rare, imports and exports restricted, and <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/humanitarian-situation-in-the-gaza-strip-fast-facts-ocha-factsheet/">children often used, and killed, for smuggling.</a></p>



<p>Though Hamdan and most of her peers have mobile phones — a lifeline for connecting with the outside world — power cuts are relentless: Az-Zawayda, her home in Deir al-Balah of some 25,000, often has barely <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/20/gaza-we-get-four-hours-electricity-day-if-were-lucky">four hours of electricity a day</a>. “There’s little to do here,” Hamdan said.</p>



<p>Before 2018, Hamdan had certainly never played a video game. That year, she learned to play Minecraft, the wildly popular computer game<strong> </strong>in which players make things out of blocks — but not purely for fun. In 2012, U.N.-Habitat, Microsoft, and Mojang, the company that made Minecraft, teamed up on <a href="https://www.blockbyblock.org/about">Block by Block</a>, a venture that aims to improve marginalized areas by actively engaging community members in public projects. According to the U.N., more than 17,000 people have participated in Block by Block initiatives in around 100 different countries — including three<strong> </strong>projects in Gaza — improving hundreds of thousands of lives in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using Minecraft’s building blocks, community groups design a virtual public space, later made into concrete reality. From parks to beaches and even streets themselves, these spaces are a key indicator of the health and sustainability of cities.<strong> </strong>“If made safe, accessible, and welcoming, they can be drivers of civic cohesion, biodiversity, livelihood, and economic growth,” Christelle Lahoud, 30, a program management officer for U.N.-Habitat, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “If not, we tend to see more crime and pollution, reduced productivity, and general social disparities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants in the Gaza experiment were selected by the Aisha Association for Women and Child Protection, an independent organization and project partner working to achieve gender integration in Gaza. Promising candidates were motivated, interested, and hungry for change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hamdan was one of 42 others — young women, mostly — given the chance to imagine a virtually designed town center through the game.<strong> </strong>The project aimed to design and build a community garden for Az-Zawayda — a modest goal.</p>



<p>Fatma Zoqlam, 18, and her sister, Ghada, 17, also made the cut, much to the approval of their mother. “She was all, like, ‘You have to do it! It will improve your confidence! And communication!’” Fatma, wearing a floral hijab and bright-purple dress, told <em>Rest of World</em> over Skype. “Not that I needed persuading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Ghada, a tad more shy, wasn’t quite as up for it. “It made me feel nervous, working in a team with strangers,” she said. The first day, the group visited the space, which was only sand, ruins, and unlit roads. “I stood there and thought, This isn’t going to work,” Fatma said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The architects introduced the world of Minecraft. “Most of us had never played a video game before,” Hamdan said, “but it was surprisingly user-friendly.” They were split into groups of four. “We took turns figuring out the keys, playing around,” Ghada said. “Once I got going, I didn’t want to stop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the second day, things got heated. Keen to impress teammates, the decision-making adults in the room, and their family and friends, things got competitive. “I wanted to have the optimal design. … Because then my work could be reflected in the actual space!” Fatma said. She leaned forward, “I wanted to be able to say to everyone I knew, I made that!”</p>

<p>“I wanted technical approval,” Ghada said. “My group was, er, leader-heavy, though. A boy took charge. He was like, ‘We need to do this, this, and this.’”</p>



<p>What the group concluded was that protective measures were a priority. “We discussed safety a lot,” Hamdan said. “Me and my friends feel scared to leave the house alone. The threat of sexual assault is too much.” (Around 51% of women in Gaza are victims of gender-based violence.) They needed lighting, fencing, security (including a guard), and a separate area for women and families. “The fence was my input,” Ghada said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Fatma, aesthetics mattered — plants, trees, a proud fountain. Her team also made a cafeteria and installed<strong> </strong>municipal Wi-Fi to keep residents connected, along with solar panels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three female Palestinian architects brought the park to fruition. One of them, Tasneem Omar, 29, described the process as “genuinely eye-opening.” Despite Minecraft’s limitations — the game allows players to use only blocks, no curved shapes — the women’s 3D efforts made her job far simpler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the workshop came to a close, Omar drew up a schematic<strong> </strong>for a park based on the team’s work and handed it over to a group of selected contractors. Save for the Wi-Fi — which was costly and might detract from the community experience of the park — they used almost everything in the team’s design.</p>



<p>On December 31, 2018, Az-Zawayda Community Garden opened. Representatives from civil society organizations in the Gaza Strip, local and international NGOs, local universities, and workshop participants attended the launch. “It was a great feeling,” said Hamdan. “I gave a speech, something I wouldn’t have had the confidence to do before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, additional projects have begun in Kosovo, Nepal, Lebanon, and Guinea; initiatives in Mozambique, South Africa, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Kyrgyzstan are currently underway. The Block by Block Foundation is also supporting coronavirus relief projects in ten affected countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For participants, the work is transformative. “We saw our work on the ground,” Fatma said, her eyes wide. “Nothing like this had been done before,” she added. “The municipality had never put us — the public — in charge.”</p>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>
<span>───────────────────┼────────────────────</span>
<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span>
       <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>

The goal of most voice and chat interactions is to provide a user experience that is as simple as possible. However, this doesn’t mean that these types of interactions are as easy to design or to build. Quite the contrary. There is a lot going on under the hood that the users never see (or, in this case, hear).</p><p>And it only becomes more complex as more modalities are added: With additional interfaces like visual and touch, maybe even gestures or sensory input, the design and development challenge can become multidimensional quickly. This is why it’s important to have a clear, abstracted process when building multimodal experiences.</p><p>In this post, I will walk you through some of the steps involved in building voice and multimodal interactions. We’ll take a look at the RIDR lifecycle, a concept that we introduced with the <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-jovo-v3-the-voice-layer/">launch of Jovo v3</a> earlier this year.</p><p>To kick things off, let’s take a look at a typical voice interaction and then see how this can be expanded to multimodal experiences.</p><h2 id="example-of-a-voice-interaction">Example of a Voice Interaction</h2><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/conversation-intro.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/conversation-intro.png"></a></figure><p>In the introduction of this post, a user asks a question (“<em>Are you open tomorrow?</em>”) and the system (e.g. a bot or an assistant) responds with a (hopefully appropriate) answer like “<em>Yes, we open at 9am.</em>”</p><p>This is what we call an <em>interaction</em>. <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/docs/requests-responses">In our definition</a>, an interaction is a single pair of a user request and a system response. </p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-response.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-response.png"></a></figure><p>What might appear like a simple interaction actually requires many steps under the hood to deliver a meaningful response.

Platforms like Amazon Alexa do all these things for you, but if you want to build your own custom voice system (e.g. voice-enabling a web or mobile app, building your own hardware), you may want to handle everything yourself. Jovo Client libraries like “<a href="https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-client-web">Jovo for Web</a>” help with some of these elements, like recording mechanisms, visual elements, silence detection, and audio conversions.</p><p>After the input is recorded, the request containing the audio is sent to the <em>Interpretation</em> step of the pipeline.</p><h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3><p>The <em>Interpretation</em> step tries to make sense of the data gathered from the <em>Request</em>.<br></p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-interpretation.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-interpretation.png"></a></figure><p>In our voice example, the previously recorded audio is now	turned into structured meaning by going through multiple steps:</p><ul><li>An automated speech recognition (ASR) service turns the audio into text</li><li>The text is then turned into a structure with <em>intents</em> and <em>entities</em> by a natural language understanding (NLU) service</li><li>Additional steps could include speaker recognition, sentiment analysis, voice biometrics, and more</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-detail.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-detail.png"></a></figure><p>The <em>Interpretation</em> takes an audio file as input, runs it through various services, and then outputs structured, machine-readable data. This is usually a result of a natural language understanding (NLU) service that is trained with multiple phrases:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/nlu-intro.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/nlu-intro.png"></a></figure><p>The service then matches the text provided by the ASR to an intent and optionally a set of entities.

Is any additional data about them available, like preferred location?</li><li>Dialog Management: Where in the conversation are we right now? Is there any additional input we need to collect from the user?</li><li>Business Logic: Is there any specific information about the business that we need to collect?</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/dialog-detail.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/dialog-detail.png"></a></figure><p>In the current example, we would collect data about opening hours, maybe specific to the user’s preferred location (if the system manages multiple locations).</p><p>All the necessary data is gathered and then handed off to the <em>Response</em>.</p><h3 id="response">Response</h3><p>In the final <em>Response</em> step, the data from the previous step is assembled into the appropriate output for the specific platform or device.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-response-1.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/ridr-response-1.png"></a></figure><p>This also usually involves:</p><ul><li>Collecting data from a content management system (CMS) with e.g. localization features</li><li>Sending the output to a text to speech (TTS) service that turns it into a synthesized voice</li></ul><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-detail.jpg"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-detail.jpg"></a></figure><p>The output is then played back to the user, either stopping the session (closing the microphone) or waiting for additional input (a new <em>Request</em>). Rinse and repeat.</p><p>This example of a voice-only interaction still seems like a manageable process to design and build. What if we add more modalities though? Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="multimodal-experiences-beyond-voice">Multimodal Experiences Beyond Voice</h2><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-request-response-1.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-request-response-1.png"></a></figure><p>The previous example shows how RIDR works with a simple interaction that uses both speech input and output. Early voice applications for platforms like Amazon Alexa focused mainly on voice-only interactions, for example when people talk to a smart speaker without a display. (<em>Note: You could argue that the LED light ring—which indicates that Alexa is listening—already makes it a multimodal interaction.</em>)</p><p>As technology evolves, interactions between users and their devices are becoming increasingly complex. As I highlight in <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-context-first/">Introducing Context-First</a>, products are becoming multimodal by default. This means that we’re seeing more interactions that either offer multiple input modalities (e.g. speech, touch, gestures) or output channels (e.g. speech, visual). <a href="https://www.context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen/">Alexa, Please Send This To My Screen</a> covers how multimodal interactions can either be continuous, complementary, or consistent experiences.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some multimodal experiences and how they could work with RIDR.</p><h3 id="examples-of-multimodal-interactions">Examples of Multimodal Interactions<br></h3><p>A multimodal experience could be as little as displaying additional (helpful) information on a nearby screen:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/visual-output.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/visual-output.png"></a></figure><p>Or, the visual display could offer touch input for faster interactions, for example in the form of a button (they are sometimes called <em>quick replies</em>):</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/quick-replies.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/quick-replies.png"></a></figure><p>It gets increasingly interesting, and challenging to implement, when two input modalities are used in tandem:</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/gestures-voice.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/gestures-voice.png"></a></figure><p>The above is similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo">Put That There</a> which I mentioned in my previous post <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-context-first/">Introducing Context-First</a>: Someone says something and provides additional context by pointing at an object. Interactions like this are challenging to decode and interpret. The process of making sense of multiple modalities is called <em>multimodal fusion</em>.</p><h3 id="multimodal-interactions-and-ridr">Multimodal Interactions and RIDR<br></h3><p>Let’s take a look at how RIDR can be abstracted even more to work with multimodal interactions. The goal is that each of the building blocks can easily be replaced depending on the current context of the interaction.</p><p>For example, the <em>Request </em>step does not necessarily need to contain just a microphone, it could also have a camera or sensors to collect user input. We could call each of these elements a <em>modality recorder</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/request-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>In the <em>Interpretation</em> step, it could also be divided into two distinct steps. A <em>recognizer</em> that turns raw input (like audio, video, even emoji or a location) into a format that’s easier to process for an <em>interpreter</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/interpretation-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>Not every interaction would need to go through each of the steps. Different input modalities might require different treatment:</p><ul><li>Text-based interactions (e.g. chatbots) can skip the speech recognition</li><li>Touch-based interactions need to take into account the payload of e.g. a button (where was it clicked?)</li><li>Vision-based interactions (e.g. gestures) need different steps that involve computer vision and interpretation</li></ul><p>As mentioned earlier, this can get even more complex as you add multiple modalities at once. For this, an additional step for <em>multimodal fusion</em> is introduced.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-fusion.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/multimodal-fusion.png"></a></figure><p>The <em>Dialog &amp; Logic</em> step from the voice example above can stay the same for now. We’ll take a deeper look at this in the next post as there are many additional layers to dive into.</p><p>The <em>Response</em> step is another interesting one. Where voice requires a text-to-speech (TTS) service, a multimodal experience might need additional elements like visual output or a video avatar. We call services fulfilling this step <em>output renderers</em>.</p><figure><a href="#" data-featherlight="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-multimodal.png"><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/09/response-multimodal.png"></a></figure><p>That’s how we currently envision multimodal user interfaces to work under the hood. This model will be updated and improved as we iteratively learn and experiment with the addition of new modalities. </p><h2 id="open-questions-and-outlook">Open Questions and Outlook<br></h2><p>This post provided a first introduction to the many steps involved when building a seemingly simple voice interaction, and how this can be applied to multimodal experiences.</p><p>Again, this is a work in progress. Here are some additional questions I currently have:</p><ul><li>Right now, this only covers user-initiated (pull) request-response interactions. What if the system starts (push)? Could sensory data be used as a trigger?</li><li>Should interpretation and dialog/logic be tied together more closely? How about dialog/logic and response? <a href="https://blog.rasa.com/demonstration-of-our-ted-policy/">Rasa’s TED policy</a> is one example where the interpretation step is doing some dialog and response work.</li><li>Are there use cases where this abstraction doesn’t work at all? Do (currently still experimental) new models like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3</a> work with this?</li></ul><p>While this was already getting a bit complex at the second half of the article, it was still a simple example.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The shipbreaking industry has been around as long as there have been ships but over the past half-century it has gravitated to regions offering both inexpensive land and cheap labor. Prior to World War II, yards in Europe, the US and Japan handled most shipbreaking, with the well known Ward yard in the United Kingdom gaining public attention by breaking up some of Britain's best known ocean liners and naval vessels.</p><p>After the end of the war, and with many worn-out ships to dispose of, Taiwan became a major destination for vessels approaching the end of their economic lifespans. This saw the Port of Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan, become a major base for the industry where vessels could be brought alongside makeshift berths and cut down using semi-skilled labor and oxy/acetylene torches. However, once the land supporting these waterfront businesses became too valuable for demolition in the 1980s the mudflats of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh rose to prominence by offering even cheaper labor as well as lax environmental regulations and low taxes.</p><p>In Europe, what remained of the shipbreaking industry gravitated from the north to less expensive locations in Spain and Turkey, with the latter nation still continuing to compete with Asian breakers for smaller ships. In the United States most shipbreaking has been consolidated along the 17-mile shipping channel leading to the Port of Brownsville,Texas, near Mexico, where much of the resulting scrap is processed, while a small yard at Port Colborne, Ontario handles some Canadian and Great Lakes ships.</p><p><strong>Kaohsiung – Once the Shipbreaking Leader</strong></p><p>The process of breaking up a ship is both dangerous and labor-intensive. In 1979 this writer was sent to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to report on the demolition of P&amp;O Line's <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong>, which had helped pioneer the Alaska cruise industry in the early 1970s.</p><p>At the time Kaohsiung was the largest ship breaking center in the world, with Hong Kong's Junk Bay a close second and South Korea closing rapidly. <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong>, built by Great Britain's famous John Brown yard at Clydebank in 1953, had been purchased by a Japanese broker in 1978 and resold to a Kaohsiung-based company for demolition. By that time the steam turbine propelled ship, built for the Australian immigrant trade, had steamed more than 2.5 million miles and was ready for retirement.</p><p>Through the auspices of the Regional Association of Old Ship Demolition Engineering Industry, a ponderously titled organization that served as an umbrella agency for the shipbreakers of Kaohsiung, I was introduced to Mr. Wang Fu Yin of Keun Hwa Steel who would be my guide though the yards. As an English-speaking staff member of one of the region's larger steel works he was in a good position to answer most of my questions concerning the industry.</p><p><strong>Dah Jen and Dah Lin Pu</strong></p><p>In the 1970s ship demolition was done at two major facilities located within the southern reaches of Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a>, Dah Jen and Dah Lin Pu, where vessels were brought alongside rather than "beached" as is done today in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This offered a much quicker demolition cycle than beaching as cut sections of ships could be loaded directly onto trucks for transport to regional mills rather than slowly pulled across mudflats for additional cutting.</p><p>Our first destination was the enormous Dah Jen complex located only a few miles from the city's airport. On our way through Kaohsiung our car was constantly passed by overburdened trucks transporting huge chunks of metal to the surrounding mills. Once in the yard itself we found ourselves surrounded by what appeared to be an endless wall of obsolete vessels; smoke, dust and powdered rust permeating the air. Around us winches were pulling cables taunt as heavy sections of metal were torn loose from hulls while fans of sparks cascaded down from hulls where workers were cutting ships apart from the inside out.</p><p><strong>Shipbreaking 101</strong></p><p>In answer to several of my questions, Mr. Wang explained how Kaohsiung's breaking industry worked. Ships were acquired on the world market through either independent brokers or the China Dismantled Vessel Trading Corporation, a purchasing cooperative formed by the breakers themselves. As is the practice today, the price was largely determined by a vessel's Light Displacement Tonnage (LDT). This is the weight of a complete but unloaded, un-fueled and un-provisioned ship. As an example, the world's largest ship of that era, the stretched petroleum tanker <strong><i>Seawise Giant</i></strong>, had a loaded displacement of 647,955 tons but a light displacement of only 83,192 tons.</p><p>Mr. Wang noted that the actual price paid per vessel varied according to market conditions, the type of ship, its construction, the quality of its steel and what additional material or equipment it might still be found aboard. This included fuel oil as well as spare propellers and shafts.</p><p>Higher prices would normally be paid for vessels having large amounts of flat steel plate, such as tankers and bulk carriers, while lower prices might be offered for passenger liners and refrigerator ships, both having complicated interiors and large amounts of wood and insulation to deal with.</p><p>During our tour of Dah Jen it could be seen that there was very little sympathy shown to ships in the actual breaking process. Great liners were torn apart, plundered, and melted down just as rapidly as the rustiest of old general cargo ships. Mr. Wang noted that each breaker maintained his own berthing area, which was sub-leased from the Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> Authority.</p><p>The docks were staggered in such a manner that they allowed about a third of a ship alongside, the other two-thirds jutting out into the water. This permitted the greatest number of ships to be broken up in the most compact area.</p><p>Demolition would usually commence several days, and sometimes several weeks, after a vessel had arrived off port. Paper work would have to be cleared, import duties tabulated, business licenses obtained and various <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> fees paid. When everything was in order a vessel would be allowed to come alongside and its crew released for the long flight home.</p><p><strong>Subcontractors</strong></p><p>Once a ship was berthed the first of a number of subcontractors would scramble on board. Kaohsiung breakers at the time used various local contractors to "clean the ship," with each group having its own specialty. The first group would normally remove loose items – furnishings, tables, chairs, mattresses, lamps, cutlery, even the galley sink – all of it going over the side and into waiting trucks for delivery to second-hand shops. Next on board would be the wood removers. This group would attack the cabins, holds and decks, stripping timbers, planks, shelving and veneers, anything considered flammable, the wood itself being bundled up for sale ashore.</p><p>Once flammables were removed the cutters would come aboard. They were considered the craftsmen of the industry and their speed largely determined the profit to be made on each vessel.</p><p>At Kaohsiung the stern of a ship would usually be dismantled first, with large sections of the hull cut and lowered onto waiting trucks. The shoreside machinery used in this process – old derricks, winches and rigging – had been removed from ships long ago melted down.</p><p>Cutting would continue down to the engine room where pumps, generators and compressors would be removed for resale while the main engine would be demolished. The propeller shaft would then be removed and the bronze propeller lifted clear, its blades to be cut off by drilling. Work would then continue forward, the ship rising slowly upwards with each ton of metal removed.</p><p>Rigging and masts would come down and deck winches cut loose, all to be lowered overboard. In six weeks the average freighter or tanker could be reduced to its double-bottom, which would be towed to a separate beach and pulled ashore for final rendering.</p><p><strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong></p><p>To visit <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong> we drove around the lower end of Kaohsiung <a href="https://www.pacmar.com/search/Harbor">Harbor</a> to the Dah Lin Pu facility where the white-hulled ship had been positioned alongside the large tanker <strong><i>Andros Apollon</i></strong>. The scene was bleak as the 100,000-dwt crude carrier, less than a decade old, was already being cut apart while <strong><i>Arcadia</i></strong> had been intentionally listed over so her remaining fuel could be pumped off, the oil going into her once pristine lifeboats for transport ashore.</p><p>At the top of the pilot ladder a guard listened patiently to Mr. Wang's excuse for our coming aboard, then waved us on into the ship's dark interior. There was neither electricity nor lights. The only sound came from a motorized pump that was working on the liner's fuel supply far below. With flashlights in hand we proceeded forward along a dark corridor until we came to the main staircase. Here, workers were moving mattresses in bundles up to the outside decks.</p><p>As we passed one cabin, its door ajar, I looked in to see the bedding gone but two glasses still standing in their holders at the sink while two white shaving towels still hung on their hooks below. Orange life vests were still visible overflowing from the closets. Nothing had been disturbed.</p><p>Moving upward, we entered a lounge where we encountered more workers cutting and rolling up sections of carpet, the furniture having already gone over the side into waiting trucks. On the outside promenade we found yet another crew busily chiseling up the wooden decks, the tropical hardwood going into large bundles.</p><p><strong>Nautical Antiques</strong></p><p>In a small room forward we came across Mr. Ming H. Wu of Rainbow Enterprises who was busy sorting through light fixtures taken from<strong> <i>Arcadia's</i></strong> various public rooms. Mr. Ming was a local antiques dealer and had purchased most of <strong><i>Arcadia's</i></strong> decorative furnishing and brass items. Beyond him were stacked many of the ship's red and white life preservers as well as brass staircase railings, bed lamps and wooden deck chairs. He explained that all of the items would be shipped overseas, largely to antique dealers in United States, Europe and Japan.</p><p>Continuing to move forward and upward we …</p></div></div>

</a>
<br>
Still from the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma
</center>
<p>Netflix recently aired a new documentary, <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/the-social-dilemma">"The Social Dilemma"</a>, which explores in detail the harmful effects that social networks such as Facebook and Instagram have on individuals and society at large. One of the interviewees in the documentary, Jeff Seibert, has written a more <a href="https://medium.com/@jeff_seibert/the-mechanics-and-psychology-behind-the-social-dilemma-719d618aa8ce">detailed piece</a> on the underlying causes, methods and impacts of current social networks on society and democracy. He argues that advertising-driven business models combined with user-generated content and machine learning lead to increased polarization and anxiety, widespread misinformation, and mass-scale manipulation of society. Some proposals to fight this include regulation, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which place strong controls on collecting data on users, even potentially banning personalized advertising.</p>
<p>We agree with Seibert, and we also have a solution. Regulation has the danger of increasing the power of the dominant incumbents, if it's not done correctly. They treat it as a burden and moat preventing competition, and competition is what is needed most. What new competitors need is a different business model. A business based on selling ads is not aligned with the interests of its user base. <strong>What if, instead of advertisers being the customer, the actual end-users were the customer?</strong> If users paid a small amount on a subscription basis, then the business would be incentivized to keep customers happy. This model may not maximize revenue for the company, but so long as the company is sustainable and able to grow, then that shouldn't matter. The apparent obsession with maximising revenue and growth at all costs is not healthy, and models in which users pay directly for services are better in the long term - for individuals and for society.</p>
<p>Whatsapp was a great example of a succesful subscription-based business. They started off charging a subscription of $1 per year. At the time of their acquisition, in 2014, Whatsapp had 450 million monthly active users, and annualized revenue of around $32M [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/28/whatsapp-revenue">source</a>], and were adding a million new users every day [<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2014/Facebook-to-Acquire-WhatsApp/default.aspx">source</a>]. For a company that had only 55 employees and operating cost around $10M, that sounds sustainable. Whatsapp also weren't really pushing for monetization, but rather growth. For example, they were relaxed about enforcing the $1 fee after the first year, and didn't apply it at all in certain countries. For comparison, at the time Facebook was making $7 in revenue per user.</p>
<p>Even a good business model can change depending on who owns the company. If investors or shareholders demand that profit is maximized, then that's what you have to do. To prevent this you either need to have benevolent investors, who aren't focused on maximising revenue at all costs, or don't have any investors. This could mean being entirely self-owned, or being a non-profit organisation. This alone probably isn't enough though - what's needed are built-in defences keeping any potential future owners honest and aligned with the users.</p>
<p>One of these defences to keep the company's interests aligned with the users is to reduce the barrier to leaving. If the social network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization">decentralized</a> then this is structurally enforced. In that case, if the company starts to misbehave in some way, users can easily move to another company (or self host) and keep all their data and friends. This is not possible with centralized social networks without open protocols. An open protocol actually takes this even further, as the user interface itself can be replaced. If the company were to start adding malicious features to the interface, people can simply switch to a different one. Combining this with being open source means it is also easy to modify the existing user interface. Social media incentives have never been this aligned with the users before. </p>
<p>There is still one major ace card to be played to protect users: end-to-end encryption. If the service cannot read your data, then it is impossible to target ads, even if they wanted to. This means that any social feed cannot be an arbitrary black box machine learning algorithm - it has to be assembled client side, thus putting end users in full control of their data and returning their autonomy. </p>
<p>The final component is ethical humane design. That means designing for the good of the human user. No manipulative notifications or dark UI patterns designed to increase engagement and steal more of the user's life. Social media should be a tool that is used to enhance people's lives, not something that manipulates people into spending more time on it. </p>
<p><em>"If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there waiting, patiently. If something is not a tool, it's demanding things from you. It's seducing you. It's manipulating you. It wants things from you. And we've moved away from having a tools based technology environment, to an addiction and manipulation based technology environment. That's what's changed. Social media isn't a tool that's just waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you."</em> <br>
</p><p>-Tristan Harris in The Social Dilemma</p>
<p>Putting all of the above together, what is needed is an open, decentralized, end-to-end encrypted and ethical social network whose business model is subscription based.</p>
<p>That's exactly what we're building.</p>

<p>When clients like mobile, desktop, single page applications allow the user to sign-in using a third party application (google, facebook, twitter etc), one of the first choice is to use OAuth 2.0 standard with authorization code flow.</p>



<p>In Authorization code flow, authorization request is made via <strong><em>browser</em></strong> and an authorization code is returned to the redirect URL registered by the client. This authorization code is used by public clients to request for an access token to get access to resources.</p>



<figure><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qfiblk0b346te5777e35.png" alt="Intercept Attack"></figure>



<p>Protecting this authorization code is thus critical but in most cases the public clients make use of custom URL scheme to capture redirects (e.g myapp://callback) thus having the risk of malicious applications to receive the authorization code.</p>



<p>Malicious apps can register the same custom URL scheme (myapp://callback) and mobile OS does not stop them to do so. As <code>authorization_code</code> is always sent back to redirect URL (in this case myapp://callback), the OS on reception of a redirect to custom URL scheme launches apps matching the scheme randomly. So the code may be sent to your app or may be the hacker app. You cannot prevent this.</p>



<h5>Authorization code flow request</h5>


<pre title="">https://authorization-server.com/auth
?response_type=code
&amp;client_id=example-client-id
&amp;redirect_uri=myapp://callback
&amp;scope=openid
&amp;state=example-state
</pre>



<h5>Authorization code flow response</h5>


<pre title="">myapp://callback
?code=hu831dsdsf23121
&amp;state=example-state
</pre>



<h5>Authorization token request</h5>


<pre title="">https://authorization-server.com/token?
grant_type=authorization_code
&amp;code=hu831dsdsf23121
&amp;redirect_uri=myapp://callback
&amp;client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&amp;client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
</pre>



<p>Well, even if they get access to the authorisation code, there is no risk as such because the attacker will not be having the client credentials (client_id, client_secret) to request for an access token. What if they have it too ?</p>



<p>In case of mobile applications, credentials are mostly hardcoded into the app and decompiling it will reveal those. Thus, for public clients it is not recommended to use client secret as it may be compromised.</p>



<p>To mitigate the risk, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization code flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie).</p>



<h2>When to use PKCE ?</h2>



<p>You have a native client, such as an app on a mobile device, or a desktop app and it does not have a secure way to store client credentials for authenticating at the token endpoint.</p>



<h2>How it works ?</h2>



<figure><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jfpzv8yvkh2s1yeern9h.png" alt="PKCE Flow"></figure>



<p>When the public clients makes the authorization request</p>



<ul><li>They first need to create a secret known as <code>code_verifier</code>. This is a cryptographically random string between 43 – 128 characters.</li></ul>


<pre title="">function base64URLEncode(str) {
    return str.toString('base64')
    .replace(/\+/g, '-')
    .replace(/\//g, '_')
    .replace(/=/g, '');
}

var code_verifier = base64URLEncode(crypto.randomBytes(32));
</pre>



<ul><li>Then use the <code>code_verifier</code> to generate a <code>code_challenge</code>. For clients that can perform a SHA256 hash, the <code>code_challenge</code> is base64 URL encoded string of the SHA256 hash of <code>code_verifier</code>, otherwise plain <code>code_verifier</code> can be used as a challenge.</li></ul>


<pre title="">function sha256(buffer) {
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(buffer).digest();
}
var code_challenge = base64URLEncode(sha256(verifier));
</pre>



<ul><li>Then it includes the <code>code_challenge</code> and a parameter to indicate method used to generate the <code>code_challenge</code> (plain or S256).</li></ul>


<pre title="">https://authorization-server.com/auth
?response_type=code
&amp;client_id=example-client-id
&amp;redirect_uri=myapp://callback
&amp;scope=openid
&amp;state=example-state
&amp;code_challenge=XXXXXXXXX
&amp;code_challenge_method=S256
</pre>



<ul><li>The authorization server then remembers the <code>code_challenge</code>, <code>code_challenge_method</code> against the authorization code it generates and then redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code.</li><li><p>When exchanging the authorization code for a token, client app need not send the <code>client_secret</code> in request, instead it sends the <code>code_verifier</code> generated before making the initial authorization request. This way even if an attacker gets the authorization code they will not have access to <code>code_verifier</code>, hence authorization code is of no use for malicious apps.</p></li></ul>


<pre title="">https://authorization-server.com/token?
grant_type=authorization_code
&amp;code=hu831dsdsf23121
&amp;redirect_uri=myapp://callback
&amp;client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&amp;code_verifier=xxxxxxxxxx
</pre>



<ul><li>Authorization server verifies the <code>code_verifier</code> parameter in request by generating the <code>code_challenge</code> as per the <code>code_challenge_method</code> stored against the authorization code. If the verification is successful, server responds with an ID and Access token.</li></ul>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<ul><li>Do not store client credentials in native and single page applications.</li><li>Use PKCE security extension of OAuth 2.0 to securely exchange an authorization code with access token.</li></ul>



<h2>References</h2>

<p>With the advancement in technology together with the advent of Agile and DevOps, the software industry is witnessing many changes. Testing, being the part of the software arena, is also advancing to great new heights.</p>



<p>From manual testing to record-and-playback tools, then to automation testing and now to codeless test automation, we have traversed a long path.</p>



<p>And as we know only change is constant, there will be further advancements to make this journey more fun and fruitful.</p>



<h2>What is <a href="https://testsigma.com/codeless-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="codeless test automation (opens in a new tab)">codeless test automation</a>?</h2>



<p>Generally, when talking about automation testing, we are talking about automation testing by coding or scripting. The test cases are coded by writing scripts in any programming language like Java, Python, Ruby etc.</p>



<p>The testing scripts are integrated with frameworks like TestNG, Cucumber, Selenium Webdriver etc. to make the scripts more advanced and high-quality.</p>



<p>When we are talking about codeless test automation, we mean that the task of writing the code manually by the testers is waived-off. The codeless test automation tool will create the script without the involvement of code and the tester is not required to learn any code for the purpose of automation of test cases.</p>



<p>There could be multiple ways the automation tool can cater to this feature. Either the tool may read the user’s navigation and clicks, and finally, create a script for those actions. Another way could be that the tester writes the test case in natural language and based on the elements mentioned the tool creates the script. </p>



<p>Codeless test automation does not mean that there is NO script. If automation is there then definitely scripting will be a part of it, only that this script will be automatically created from codeless automated steps written by the Tester.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This codeless automation will reduce the upfront time required to write the test scripts and setting up of the framework. Also, it becomes easier for the tester to use such codeless test automation tools. Even a manual tester with limited knowledge of scripting can start using the codeless automation testing tools.</p>



<h2>Codeless test automation tools</h2>



<p>There are many codeless test automation tools available today in the market. Below are a few examples of codeless automation testing tools-</p>



<p><strong>1. Testsigma: </strong>A cloud-based test automation platform. Here, test cases can be automated using simple English. The execution and reporting are handled on the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>2. Test Complete:</strong> A tool that uses keyword-driven testing to enable scriptless test automation. Here, each action is associated with a keyword which can be added in a script by the user.</p>



<p><strong>3. Ghost inspector:</strong> A tool that records user actions on the UI and compares screenshots too, to enable scriptless test automation.</p>



<p><strong>4. Ranorex: </strong>Ranorex allows record and playback for simpler scenarios and coding for the complicated ones.</p>



<h2>Advantages of codeless test automation tools</h2>



<p><strong>1. Minimum coding skills required</strong></p>



<p>The testers need not have strong coding skills in case of codeless test automation tools.</p>



<p>Basic knowledge is acceptable since the tool itself will be taking care of the <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/scriptless-test-automation-tool-why-testsigma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="scripting part (opens in a new tab)">scripting part</a>. Usually, the user-interface of a codeless automation testing tool is such that it eradicates the complexity from the script development. The easy to understand user interface makes the test case scripting so much easier than anyone with the functional knowledge of the application can do it.</p>



<p><strong>2. Usage by stakeholders- Business Analyst, Product Owners, Subject Matter Experts</strong></p>



<p>All the stakeholders of the application are able to understand, review and discuss the test cases written using a codeless test automation tool. The absence of complex coding structure makes the test cases easier so that they can be used by the customer in UAT(User Acceptance Testing). This enhances the reusability of the test cases and also provides more depth in the communication between all the stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong>3. Time Efficiency</strong></p>



<p>The upfront time required in writing the scripts for test cases, creation of the framework, training the team and maintenance is reduced considerably.</p>



<p>The test cases can be developed in minimum time and the execution may start real quick. Moreover, once a testing framework is ready, with time and new changes the framework requires maintenance. Sometimes this becomes a major setback, especially in an Agile environment. These codeless test automation tools also employ AI/ML technologies for automatic healing of changes thus time is saved and can be utilised in other testing activities.</p>



<p><strong>4. Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform support</strong></p>



<p>We need tests to be run on multiple ranges of browsers and different platforms, a good <em>codeless test automation </em>tool accommodates all of these features.</p>



<p><strong>5. Easier Maintenance</strong></p>



<p>To design an automation testing framework is the initial step, it doesn’t conclude the automation testing framework creation. Whenever there is a requirement change and enhancement, the test scripts need to change. This becomes the most time-consuming and important task of all the automation activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With codeless automation testing tools, this task is as easy as the script creation. The framework provided by the tool follows a particular structure and architecture, this results in a properly managed framework. Proper structure helps in achieving better traceability and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, there are tools like Testsigma that have the feature for self-healing where if a test case fails due to some minor changes in the code structure – they are corrected automatically.</p>



<p><strong>6. Reliability</strong></p>



<p>With most of the maintenance headache taken by the AI/ML capabilities. The test cases created via these tools are more reliable too. As we have seen in the above point, the <em>codeless test automation</em> tools follow a structured architecture with reusability being the key element. The multiple application type testing support, cross-browser and cross-platform support provides better coverage and hence enhances the reliability.</p>



<p><strong>7. Reusability</strong></p>



<p>The codeless test automation tools are built with the intent of reusability. The test steps which are generic and common in test cases are made reusable. Whenever needed, these reusable test steps are inserted in the test case, reducing the script size. Whenever a change occurs in the reusable script, only that test script is impacted and all other test cases are intact.</p>



<p><strong>8. Better Reporting</strong></p>



<p>In case of scripting the tests ourselves using scripting languages, we need to write custom scripts for the reporting also. For example, testNG and cucumber provide reports after the test run but still, we need to write basic code for the incorporation of the custom reports. Codeless test automation tools have the <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/10-features-every-scriptless-automation-testing-tool-must-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="best features (opens in a new tab)">best features</a> available with them, the reporting is better and easy as compared to scripting the code ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>9. Best bet in an Agile environment</strong></p>



<p>The fast-paced code development/deployment in an Agile environment leads to lesser time for coding the automation testing scripts. In such a situation, codeless automation testing tools seem to be the best option available. We need not train the existing people in a new programming language to write test scripts. Also, the time that would be consumed in writing test scripts can be used in other testing activities like- exploratory testing, performance testing etc.</p>



<p><strong>10. Better ROI</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;When we are working with automation testing tools/frameworks, the ROI (Return on investment)&nbsp; is a major deciding factor. Reason being the amount of time, effort, cost invested in writing and designing an automation testing framework is really high if this all is done from scratch. We need to carefully examine our requirements and the features and return the framework is going to provide. The investment we have made should not outweigh the return we will receive in future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of all these initial setups and investments made in an automation testing tool, the SAF(Scriptless Automation Framework) or tool seems better where ROI is concerned. The initial test case setup and writing will be quicker and we can start the testing as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Misconceptions related to codeless test automation</h2>



<p><strong>1. Scriptless means-NO script</strong></p>



<p>The name scriptless is sort of deceiving here, it doesn’t necessarily mean a complete absence of script or code. It is, however, the absence of writing the code ourselves, the code gets generated by the tool. The tool creates the script using the user-action on the application, or the tester specifies test steps using keywords or natural language. These user-actions or the keyword-based test steps are converted to the code by the tool for execution and here lies the beauty of it.</p>



<p><strong>2. Coded automation cannot be added via these tools</strong></p>



<p>Most people hear codeless and then they think that it should be limited in functionality. And if they needed to add some custom functionality then it wouldn’t be possible. But, that is not the case. There are tools like Testsigma that understand that there could be scenarios where you may want to write custom code to add custom automation capabilities. And these tools provide you with the ability to add the custom code along with the codeless scripts.</p>



<p><strong>3. It is Record-and-Playback</strong></p>



<p>Codeless test automation tools are definitely not Record-and-Playback tools. While record-and-playback we get the steps generated by the tool as per the user’s interaction with the AUT. The test data gets hardcoded into the test steps and if any changes are required, coding skills are required. If there are any changes in the application, the record-and-playback is required to be run again, because of the inflexibility of the …</p></div></div>

    <!--summary-->

<p>Today, we’ll cover a cool <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">Terraspace</a> feature. It allows you to deploy all of your infrastructure in a single command.</p>



<p>Terraspace calculates the dependencies and deploys your code in the right order.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="terraform-recommendations">Terraform Recommendations</h2>

<p>First, let’s talk about some Terraform recommendations. They recommend separating your code on a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/guides/recommended-practices/part1.html#one-workspace-per-environment-per-terraform-configuration">per configuration and environment basis</a>. Here are examples straight from the docs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>billing-app-dev</li>
  <li>billing-app-prod</li>
  <li>networking-dev</li>
  <li>networking-prod</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a table to help explain these “scoped configurations” in different contexts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform Cloud</td>
      <td>A workspace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform OSS</td>
      <td>A terraform module with a separate statefile</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraspace</td>
      <td>A stack</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Believe the reasons for the strategy are because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It avoids a monolithic structure and statefile that can take forever to run. See: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18981">Terraform takes a very long time to run</a>. It’s not fun to wait 20+ minutes for your <code>terraform apply</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s safer to update. Since the changes are more limited in scope, the blast radius is reduced.</li>
  <li>It helps decouple the code to logically reusable units.</li>
</ol>

<p>You deploy these “scoped configurations” separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>One of the main issues with separating your code into separate stacks is that you have to deploy them independently. For example, you must manually deploy the VPC and then the instance afterward. You lose a significant advantage of what Terraform does: orchestration.</p>

<h2 id="enter-terraspace-all">Enter Terraspace All</h2>

<p>The <code>terraspace all</code> commands solves this problem by calculating the dependency graph and deploying the stacks in the correct order for you. Terraspace also parallelizes the batches. Here’s a dependency graph example.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s deploy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up
Will run:
   terraspace up b2 # batch 1
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
   terraspace up a1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you confirm, Terraspace deploys the batches in parallel. Essentially, Terraspace handles the orchestration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y
Batch Run 1:
Running: terraspace up b2 Logs: log/up/b2.log
Running: terraspace up c1 Logs: log/up/c1.log
Running: terraspace up c3 Logs: log/up/c3.log
Running: terraspace up d1 Logs: log/up/d1.log
terraspace up b2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up d1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 2:
Running: terraspace up b1 Logs: log/up/b1.log
Running: terraspace up c2 Logs: log/up/c2.log
terraspace up b1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 3:
Running: terraspace up b3 Logs: log/up/b3.log
terraspace up b3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 4:
Running: terraspace up a1 Logs: log/up/a1.log
terraspace up a1:  Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Time took: 41s
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace provides a reduced-noise summary of the runs. The full logs are also written for further inspection and debugging. The <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/reference/terraspace-log/">terraspace log</a> command is useful for viewing the logs.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-configure-dependencies">How to Configure Dependencies</h2>

<p>To configure dependencies, you merely wire stack outputs to inputs variables of another stack. Here is an example of an instance stack that depends on a vpc stack.</p>

<p>app/stacks/vpc/outputs.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>output "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID"
  value       = aws_vpc.this.id
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>app/stacks/instance/variables.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC to launch instance in"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wire them together with the <code>terraform_output</code> helper in the instance tfvars file.</p>

<p>app/stacks/instance/tfvars/base.tfvars</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vpc_id = &lt;%= terraform_output('vpc.vpc_id') %&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace infers the dependency from this connection. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Learn more: <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/deploy-multiple/">Deploy Multiple Stacks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-with-graphs">Visualizing with Graphs</h2>

<p>You can create a visual dependency graph diagram with:</p>



<p>The earlier example dependency graph was generated with this command:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="targeting-subgraphs-and-subtrees">Targeting Subgraphs and Subtrees</h2>

<p>You can target subgraphs by specifying stack names. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace all graph b1 b3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1-sub-b1-b3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can filter for stacks with any of all commands. Here’s an example with up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up b1 b3
Will run:
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This targets the b1 and b3 stacks and their dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="tearing-it-all-down">Tearing it All Down</h2>

<p>Finally, to tear down all the infrastructure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all down
Will run:
   terraspace down a1 # batch 1
   terraspace down b3 # batch 2
   terraspace down b1 # batch 3
   terraspace down c2 # batch 3
   terraspace down b2 # batch 4
   terraspace down c1 # batch 4
   terraspace down c3 # batch 4
   terraspace down d1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’re ready, type <code>y</code> and enter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y

<p>Terraspace helps you solve the issue of having to deploy individual stacks manually. Instead of having to run <code>terraspace up</code> individually, it allows you to deploy all stacks with a single command:</p>



<p>Additionally, you can target <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/subgraphs/">subgraphs</a> to deploy:</p>



<p>Lastly, you can always drop down and run the individual stack to debug. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace up c1
terraspace up b1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace gives you the best of both worlds. To learn more about Terraspace check out <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">terraspace.cloud</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Teams in a DevOps organisation should be free to setup and manage the infrastructure for their services. Terraform is a great way to allow teams to declaratively define their infrastructure needs. However, from a compliance and security perspective, you want to place certain guardrails in place. One such guardrail is of course restricting the set of permissions the teams are given. This stops teams from deploying infrastructure your organisation does not have a need for (Most likely your teams do not need to setup <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ground-station/">satellite connections from the cloud</a>) and prevents them from editing resources not managed by them. But it does not cover all rules and regulations that you want to enforce. You also want to ensure that teams do not create public databases, or that the naming convention of your organisation is followed.</p><p>One approach you could take is to setup an auditing service like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config</a>:</p><blockquote><p>AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance. With AWS Config you can discover existing AWS resources, export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.</p></blockquote><p>Together with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html">AWS system manager automation</a> you can even automatically remediate actions based on configuration changes. For example you could automatically remove public read/write ACLs from a S3 bucket.</p><p>There are two problems with this approach however:</p><ol><li><p>It only works for AWS resources. If you have resources in multiple cloud providers or if you are deploying applications on top of Kubernetes you need to setup different tools for those environments. Which also means that you need to spend time to become familiar with those tools. Compliance regulations could be configured differently in the different environments, leading to inconsistency and potential violations of company policy.</p></li><li><p>It is applied after the resources are deployed. Of course in severe cases most likely you automatically remediate the action, meaning no manual action is required. However, there is no visibility for the team why it was changed. They might not even be aware a change happened!</p></li></ol><h2 id="introducing-the-open-policy-agent">Introducing the Open Policy Agent</h2><p>In order to remediate the previously described issues, we need a more flexible tool for our governance needs. Preferably we also would like to run the tool as a validation step before the resources are actually deployed.</p><p>Luckily for us, such a tool exists, the <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine with uses ranging from authorization and admission control to data filtering. OPA provides greater flexibility and expressiveness than hard-coded service logic or ad-hoc domain-specific languages. And it comes with powerful tooling to help you get started</p></blockquote><p>The Open Policy Agent allows you to define policies in based on the Rego language, which is a declarative language based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a>. The Open Policy Agent can be integrated into your application landscape on three ways:</p><ol><li><p>Running as a standalone server that can be queried for policy evaluation. This is great for runtime policy evaluation. For example, <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper">integrating OPA as a Kubernetes admission controller</a>.</p></li><li><p>Using the OPA CLI as a command line tool. This could be used to evaluate policies as part of a CI/CD pipeline. For example using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest">conftest</a> to validate infrastructure configuration.</p></li><li><p>Embedding OPA as a Go library into your application. A great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/chef/automate/tree/master/components/authz-service">Chef Automate</a>, which build an IAM system leveraging OPA.</p></li></ol><p>As you can see, OPA provides a lot of flexibility. This allows one policy to be applied in multiple ways. You no longer need to learn several proprietary tools, instead you only need to become familiar with Rego.</p><h2 id="getting-started-with-rego-policies">Getting started with Rego policies</h2><p>With OPA you query data (By default, OPA support JSON), which can be pulled in by OPA or send via its REST APIs. Along side the data, you define a set of policies which define the state of the data. For example, you could define a policy that states that all S3 buckets should have ACLs that disallow public access. These policies are written in Rego.</p><p>Rego is a declarative language, which means that a policy writer can focus more on what the policy should return, rather then on how to execute the queries. It has great support for dealing with deeply nested structures (such as JSON). It also supports many built in functions to be able to support complex policies.</p><p>The basic unit in a Rego policy is a rule. Rules allow you to make an assertion about the desired state.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang">sites <span>:=</span> [{<span>"name"</span>: <span>"prod"</span>}, {<span>"name"</span>: <span>"smoke1"</span>}, {<span>"name"</span>: <span>"dev"</span>}]

prod_exists { sites[_].name <span>==</span> <span>"prod"</span> }</code></pre></div><p>In the above policy, you assign an array of JSON objects to the rule <code>sites</code>. In rule <code>prod_exists</code> we make an assertion: There exists a site in sites with the name “prod”. When we query this rule with OPA, it will return true, because currently the <code>sites</code> object contains a site named “prod”. You do not have to write a for-loop over the <code>sites</code> array and write an if-statement to check if the name is equal to “prod” and then return true. You can just state the assertion and OPA will figure out how to execute the query!</p><p>We can improve on the above example by generalising the rule:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang">exists[name] {  name <span>:=</span> sites[_].name }</code></pre></div><p>Now the rule <code>exists</code> will return the set of all names in <code>sites</code>. We can rewrite the <code>prod_exists</code> rule as follow:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang">prod_exists { exists[<span>"prod"</span>] }</code></pre></div><p>Rego also support functions. There is a whole list of build in functions: Aggregation functions, Regex, Set operations, you name it. Rego also allows you to define your own functions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>is_proper_url</span>(url) {
    <span>re_match</span>(<span>`https?:\/\/(www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&amp;//=]*)`</span>, url)
}</code></pre></div><p>Here we define a function <code>is_proper_url</code> which takes in a url and evaluates whether it matches a regex pattern (using the build in <code>re_match</code> function). When evaluating the query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>is_proper_url</span>(<span>"https://play.openpolicyagent.org"</span>)</code></pre></div><p>This will return the value true.</p><p>Rego policies are ordered in packages:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> url

<span>is_proper_url</span>(url) {
    <span>re_match</span>(<span>`https?:\/\/(www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&amp;//=]*)`</span>, url)
}</code></pre></div><p>And these packages can be imported in other policies using the import statement:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>import</span> data.url

url.<span>is_proper_url</span>(<span>"https://play.openpolicyagent.org"</span>)</code></pre></div><p>Note that we import from data. OPA treats both policies and input (JSON) data as data.</p><p>These simple snippets hopefully show the power of a declarative language. Instead of focusing on the details, such as how to loop over an array of data, OPA will figure out how to execute the query. As a policy writer, you just make assertions on the expected state of the system. If you want to know more about writing policies in Rego, I suggest checking out <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/how-do-i-write-policies/">the documentation</a>. There is also <a href="https://play.openpolicyagent.org/">the Rego playground</a> which allows you to play around with policies.</p><p>Next lets work on a real world example! Along the way I will show some of the more advanced features of Rego.</p><h2 id="using-the-open-policy-agent-to-validate-terraform-plans">Using the Open Policy Agent to validate Terraform plans</h2><p>Before Terraform deploys a set of resources it creates a plan of all the changes it will apply. With OPA, we can validate these plans to ensure they comply with our regulations and standards.</p><p>Now lets work on a real world situation. Lets say we have several teams working with Terraform to deploy AWS resources. We want to ensure teams apply <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/">AWS Tagging best practices</a>, as it allows us to easily search for resources and setup budget reports per team.</p><p>Terraform generates a terraform specific execution plan. However, OPA only understands JSON input. Luckily, Terraform 0.12 came with the ability to output plans in json (For Terraform pre 0.12, you can use <a href="https://github.com/palantir/tfjson">tfjson</a>):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">terraform plan -out<span>=</span>tfplan
terraform show -json ./tfplan &gt; tfplan.json</code></pre></div><p>Terraform outputs a deeply nested JSON structure that shows both the previous state of the resources and shows the state after executing the plan. Luckily OPA shines in dealing with complicated JSON as we will see.</p><p>We will validate our policies against this JSON plan. In order to simplify the setup of our validation pipeline, we will use <a href="https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest">conftest</a>, which provides a CLI around OPA. Conftest is created to simplify running OPA to validate configuration files in automation. It also provides support for formats other then JSON, such as YAML and TOML. We can use it to validate our Terraform plan against a set of policies (by default conftest looks for a policy directory in your project):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">conftest <span>test</span> tfplan.json</code></pre></div><p>Conftest by default looks for <code>deny[msg]</code> and <code>warn[msg]</code> rules, therefore providing a set of best practices on how to setup your Rego policies. The <code>msg</code> can contain additional description on why the rule was triggered. So lets set up some policies! First we will create a package to evaluate our tags:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> tags_validation

minimum_tags = {<span>"ApplicationRole"</span>, <span>"Owner"</span>, <span>"Project"</span>}

<span>key_val_valid_pascal_case</span>(key, val) {
    <span>is_pascal_case</span>(key)
    <span>is_pascal_case</span>(val)
}

<span>is_pascal_case</span>(<span>string</span>) {
    <span>re_match</span>(<span>`^([A-Z][a-z0-9]+)+`</span>, <span>string</span>)
}

<span>tags_contain_proper_keys</span>(tags) {
    keys <span>:=</span> {key | tags[key]}
    leftover <span>:=</span> minimum_tags <span>-</span> keys
    leftover <span>==</span> <span>set</span>()
}</code></pre></div><p>We define three functions here: <code>key_val_valid_pascal_case</code> validates whether the keys and values are proper pascal case, <code>is_pascal_case</code> is a helper function that determines whether a string is pascal case. <code>tags_contain_proper_keys</code> validates whether the tags contain atleast the minumum set of tags: ApplicationRole, Owner and Project. Note that we are using a <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/how-do-i-write-policies/#set-comprehensions">set comprehension</a> to generate a set of keys after which we use set operations to check if the tags contain the minimum set.</p><p>Now that we have the functions in place to validate the tags, we can write the actual rules. Ideally our rules also contain some information on which resources where …</p></div></div>

We use <a href="https://www.metabase.com/" as="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to build BI dashboards that can answer questions about how people interact with us. These dashboards reference our Web analytics data, user data and all events happening across the estate. We can find out how many people queried the Splitgraph <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect">Data Delivery Network</a> on a given week, how they found Splitgraph, or if they ever pulled a data image.</p><p>This works without any ETL pipelines or a data warehouse. How do we do it?</p><p>Well, we use Splitgraph.</p><p>In this post, we'll talk about our analytics stack. We'll discuss how we use Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command to proxy to data from Matomo, Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL. We'll show a sample SQL query that runs a federated JOIN between these three databases. Finally, we'll talk about how we use Metabase to get a clear view of the business.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/blog/images/20200918-splitgraph-matomo-elasticsearch-metabase/00-diagram.png"><em>Architecture diagram of our analytics setup.</em></p><section><h2 id="our-analytics-stack">Our analytics stack</h2><p>We hate third-party trackers. At the same time, we would like to know what's happening on the website and across the company in general. In the age of CDNs, a visit to a website might never reach the origin server. HTTP server logs won't show the full story about website visitors.</p><p>To solve that, we started using <strong><a href="https://matomo.org/" as="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a></strong>. Matomo is an open-source web analytics platform. It offers a similar interface and feature set to Google Analytics. However, unlike GA, it stores all data locally in a MySQL database.</p><p>Besides visiting the website, there's a lot of other ways users can interact with Splitgraph. For example:</p><ul><li>Starring Splitgraph on GitHub or downloading a release</li><li>Querying the Splitgraph <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect">Data Delivery Network</a> from an SQL client</li><li>Pushing and pulling <a href="https://splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/images" as="https://splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/images">data images</a> to/from Splitgraph</li><li>Using the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">REST API</a></li><li>Checking for updates: we use this to estimate the number of active <code>sgr</code> users</li></ul><p>We use <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> to log these and other interesting events.</p><p>Finally, we have a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database that stores actual user data. Some of it could be useful to know in an analytics context. For example: a user's primary e-mail address or their GitHub ID.</p></section><section><h2 id="how-to-bring-the-data-together">How to bring the data together?</h2><p>The idea for this setup came to us when we were trying to get some data from the Matomo Web UI. While it is pretty powerful, it's limited in the kinds of reports it can produce. Also, data we'd see in Matomo didn't include anything we store in Elasticsearch.</p><p>We wondered if we could query the data from Matomo's MySQL database directly. The <a href="https://developer.matomo.org/guides/database-schema" as="https://developer.matomo.org/guides/database-schema">schema</a>, albeit complex, is well documented on their website.</p><p>We could ingest data into Elasticsearch. However, we were already using Kibana to visualize Elasticsearch data and its visualizations were sometimes frustrating to use. Basic functionality like plotting sums is only available through scripted Elasticsearch fields.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/blog/images/20200918-splitgraph-matomo-elasticsearch-metabase/01-kibana.png"><em>Pictured: five different visualization engines that Kibana lets you use</em></p><p>But then we thought about it some more. Splitgraph itself is built on top of PostgreSQL. One of its features is making PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">foreign data wrappers</a> more user-friendly. Splitgraph's <code>sgr mount</code> lets you instantiate an FDW with a single command. You can then query the data directly or snapshot it.</p><p>Could we use a Splitgraph instance and add a MySQL FDW to it to query Matomo data?</p><p>And if we did, could we use an Elasticsearch FDW to proxy to our events data?</p><p>And if we did that, could we use something like <a href="https://www.metabase.com/" as="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> and point it at Splitgraph, letting it query data across all our data silos?</p><p>Turns out, we could. Here's an abridged version of how we mount Matomo data on a Splitgraph instance. We have a full set of commands on <a href="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/cross-db-analytics" as="https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/cross-db-analytics">our GitHub</a>.</p><pre><code>sgr mount mysql_fdw matomo_raw -c matomo:$PASSWORD@matomo-db -o@- &lt;&lt;EOF

		<div>
			
<p>If you have recently been promoted to tech lead, or doing it for a while, you’ll deeply appreciate that there is hardly any time for coding, or maybe zero time at all.</p>



<p>There are a lot of people related things to do, project planning things to do, improving for the future or responding to emergencies. It can quickly turn into a blue screen of meeting appointments and none of them say “work on your favourite coding project”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course you could code in your spare time, but let’s face it often we are too tired after working all day, and there are friends, hobbies and commitments outside of work.</p>



<p>You want to code more because, it is your passion! And also so you can understand what your team is talking about. And also if things go south, to pass a coding test for your next job! For me the main reason is because coding and building stuff is damn awesome!</p>



<h2>So how to get deep into some coding again?</h2>



<p>I have come up with the top 3 ways I know from experience will help you to keep up with coding. Not all of these will be instant – it might take a few weeks to work them in, but they will pay off and free up your time for coding, which is definitely a part of your job as a tech lead in most companies.</p>



<h3>1. Delegation</h3>



<p>Delegation is more than just dumping your work on other people and slapping your hands together with a grin. In-fact if you are not used to it, it can feel mentally harder than just doing the thing yourself. However you will be forced to delegate at some point due to your limit hours per week and so many Slacks and emails coming in. I suggest you actively choose what to delegate and be ruthless.</p>



<p>Delegation can be a whole blog post of book of it’s own. So I will reduce this down to one simple tip – each day try to delegate something that you previously would be loathed to delegate. What is that for you?</p>



<p>For me it is running the daily standups, I felt like that was a “Team Leaders Job” and that developers would be against doing this. However once I started doing it, well it worked out perfectly fine and I think we got a lot of benefits in terms of engagement in the meetings. If you know it’s your turn to run the meeting soon you probably won’t zone out.</p>



<p>The key point about delegation is to be clear what you are asking, and to follow up. It’s still your responsibility, it is just someone else is doing the heavy lifting for you now.</p>



<p>Once you get better or more used to delegation you’ll get more time for yourself to do what you want, including coding work.</p>



<h2>2. Keep it boring</h2>



<p>As a tech lead you are now the voice of reason, and you are thinking of the business. Convert everything to NoSQL, Kubernetes and NextJS? As a developer you might love a company that chooses a lot of new or different tech, it’s fun to learn and apply. However as a lead you need to think about what will actually pan out well, where the future issues and risks might lay.</p>



<p>By keeping the tech boring – by which I mean make well thought out and informed technology choices – you will do your team a big favour by helping make it easy to deliver things on time. It also increases your chance of being able to contribute.</p>



<p>Here you can carve out little 1 hour tasks that you can do yourself to keep you in the loop. An example is upgrading package dependencies and fixing any issues that introduces. As a result you would be forced to, for example look at the release notes for the next version of React or Typescript say and learn what is new. Hint – if you do this a lot it won’t be anything too exciting, some bug fixes and the odd feature.</p>



<p>By keeping it boring you increase the chance of you being able to contribute to the code, and keep coding.</p>



<h2>3. Choose some people to follow</h2>



<p>Go follow blogs from great developers such as <a href="https://overreacted.io/">Dan Abarmov</a>, or read an article from the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> back catalog (he writes <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeAsDocumentation.html">timeless stuff</a>) can keep you up to date and learning new things. It is a very efficient method to find trusted distilled information. Be choosy about who you follow! And over time keep changing it up.</p>



<p>Come up with an easy to follow schedule, e.g. read one blog post per week, whatever is easy to achieve and start from there. Even better, read a post, then discuss it with your team as part of an appropriate meeting (e.g. you might have architectural meetings or such like), and see what everyone’s viewpoint is on the ideas in the post. You might even get an action out of it that will help you on your current workload.</p>



<p>By following blogs like these, you are not coding per-se, but you are learning which will help you keep up to date, and sometimes it will mean you discover a tool or way of doing things your team can take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now I have just given you a lot more stuff to do, which in itself might feel like a pain. It is an investment though. Try to anchor these onto something you already do. If you do one-on-one meetings for example you could add a “work to delegate” item to that agenda. Now you don’t have to think about this anymore, until you are in the meeting.</p>







<p>They are my 3 main tips for finding more time, hope you found it useful.</p>



<p>Now it is time to think about what you are going to do next. Here is what I recommend:</p>



<p>Of the 3 tips, if you are only going to do one, then work on delegation, and do the following right now:</p>



<p><em>(If you are not at work now, send an email to your work address to remind yourself when you are back in.)</em></p>



<ul><li><strong>Actions</strong>:<ul><li>Write down a quick summary of the stuff you need to do today at work.</li><li>Pick a task that you would normally be nervous for any reason to delegate to someone else.</li><li>Acknowledge the reason why you are nervous</li><li>Make sure you can describe the task in such a way you can hand it to someone in the team.</li><li>Pick the best person to do this, and tell them to do it.</li><li>Put a date in your calendar to follow up on the task</li><li>Put a date in your calendar to repeat this exercise</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Well done you have now <em>really</em> delegated something, and once it is done, you will be able to delegate this task again and again.</p>



<p>Soon enough, you will find the problem is what tech work to work on in your newly freed up time. A good problem to have.</p>

		It's often really hard to know what to learn next in the React world, where to spend your limited time as a developer, and how to keep up with all the tech changes and fads out there.
	</p><p>
However it doesn't really have to be like that. 
</p><p>
Focus on the core things that you really need to succeed, and build your satisfaction and career. Keep on top of it, by knowing what "it" really is.

<p>QtQuick, in one word, is <em>amazing</em>. </p>
<p>QtQuick, in slightly more words, is a scene graph implementation. At a developer level we create abstract "Items" which might be some text or a rectangle etc or a picture. This in turn gets transformed into a tree of nodes with geometry, "materials" and transforms. In turn this gets translated into a big long stream of OpenGL instructions which we send to the graphic card.</p>
<p>Qt6 will see this officially change to sit on top of the "Render Hardware Interface" stack, that instead of always producing OpenGL, will support Vulkan, Metal and Direct3D natively. The super clever part about it is that custom shaders (low level fast drawing) are also abstracted; meaning we will write some GLSL and generate the relevant shader for each API without having to duplicate the work.</p>
<p>This blog series gives a lot more detail: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d</a>.</p>
<p>Plasma code primarily interacts with Items and occasionally nodes, slightly above the level being abstracted. </p>

<p>Qt 5.15 ships with a tech preview of RHI and the Vulkan interface. I spent some time to set it up and explore what we need to do to get our side fully working. With some packages installed, a few plasma code fixes and some env vars set, I have a fully working Vulkan plasmashell.</p>
<h2>Screenshot</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plasma_vulkan.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plasma_vulkan-939x1024.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly it looks the same, so a screenshot is very unexciting. I enabled the Mesa overlay as some sort of proof.<br>
The reason it shows 2fps is because plasmashell only updates when something has changed; in this case the textcursor blinking every 500ms.</p>
<p>Despite it being a preview it is in a damn good state! Things are usable, and really quite snappy, especially notification popups.</p>
<h2>What needs work</h2>
<p>Some things need work on our side, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our custom shaders need porting to the updated shader language.</li>
<li>Taskbar thumbnails use low level GL code that needs one extra layer of implementation.</li>
<li>Use of QtQuickWidget in systemsettings. </li>
</ul>
<p>It means some elements are invisible or don't render with the full graphical effects, or in the last case, crash. </p>
<p>But in the whole scheme of things, everything is in a very encouraging state</p>
<h3>What about KWin?</h3>
<p>Whilst QtQuick is the cornerstone of plasmashell, systemsettings and so many applications, for historical reasons KWin made use of OpenGL before it was a mainstream part of Qt. Therefore this setup is mostly unrelated to KWin. Fortunately there's no reason these two have to be in sync.</p>

<p>This isn't usable for end users, and given it's only a tech preview upstream, this is not something we can ever expect to officially support within Plasma 5.</p>
<p>But we can start doing the prep work, also the current state is so promising I think we can deliver a native Vulkan experience to users on the first day of Plasma 6.</p>

September 21, 2020 | https://ramenpotential.com/understanding-marketing | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ramenpotential.com/understanding-marketing">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article is a part of the series that I am writing on marketing while learning and implementing it in public. Learn <a href="https://ramenpotential.com/marketing">more about it here.</a></p>
<p>Any act of communication between a business and the outside world is marketing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our landing page</li>
<li>Our social media post</li>
<li>Our offers</li>
<li>Our product</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is marketing.</p>
<p>In words of marketing guru Peter Drucker - <b>"Ideally, marketing should result in a customer who is ready to buy."</b></p>
<p>To get a customer to buy, there are two crucial steps that marketing should do -</p>
<h3>1. Improve reach</h3>
<p>Improve discoverability and awareness about the business to increase reach.</p>
<h3>2. Build trust</h3>
<p>Build a level of trust that the potential customers feel comfortable getting in to a relationship (become a user of the product).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Digging deeper into reach</h3>
<p><img src="https://ramenpotential.com/images/marketing-reach-and-trust.png" alt="Marketing activities for trust and reach"></p>
<p>Here are a few marketing activities that can improve reach and discoverability.</p>
<h4 id="content-marketing">1. Content Marketing</h4>
<p>Before we look for specific means and tactics of doing content marketing. Let's understand why it works.</p>
<p>At the very core of the internet is inter-linked content. Whether you do a query on search engines, scroll through feed on social media or watch videos on youtube, even the journey to getting to utility products starts with searching and engaging with content.</p>
<p>People are looking for content that does atleast one of these two things -</p>
<ol>
<li>Educate them - They want to be educated on the problems that they have</li>
<li>Entertain them - They want to be entertained</li>
</ol>
<p>In marketing, when they say <code>provide value</code> to attract customers, they mean either educate them or entertain them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Good marketing either educates or entertains potential customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When people relevant to our domain look for the solution to their problems, we have to be present there with our content. This makes our business inbound discoverable. It is also the most valuable, meaningful and long term result yielding form of marketing.</p>
<p>Of course, this needs a deep understanding of what our customers are looking for and where they are looking for it.</p>
<p>🛑 Taking this approach of marketing has a few deterrents -</p>
<ol>
<li>We have to really know what our customers are looking for and where.</li>
<li>It's a long game. It takes about 6-9 months for this effort to start producing results.</li>
<li>Producing good content consistently without seeing immediate success is hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>📈 That said, it also has multifold advantages -</p>
<ol>
<li>The more content we produce, the larger the compounding effect is. Over a period of time, small gains accumulate and result in massive traffic.</li>
<li>Just the act of producing content and seeing which one performs well give us insight into our customers which is extremely valuable to base our business and product strategies on.</li>
<li>When we educate, it builds trust with potential customers, which we will talk about in the next section.</li>
</ol>
<p>At an execution level, there are many tactics which I will write about in detail as I go about implementing them.</p>
<div>
<h5>Action steps</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand what our customers are looking for and where</p>
<ul>
<li>It dictates topics and media that we produce content on. E.g. Blog, Podcast, Videos etc.</li>
<li>Come up with a list of places we should distribute content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce content that educates or entertains</p>
<ul>
<li>Has short term gains through our content distribution channels like social media</li>
<li>Results in better SEO, better discoverability in long term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are levers that we can use here to amplify our reach. For example, standing on the shoulder of giants to distribute content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest posting</li>
<li>Appearing on podcasts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="ads">2. Ads</h4>
<p>Publishing ads on various platforms can result in quick, short-term discoverability. It's good to try it out and see the results.</p>
<p>It does its job of making our business discoverable but it doesn't really build any trust.</p>
<div>
<h5>Action steps</h5>
<ul>
<li>Find out which platforms does our customers hangout on</li>
<li>Play around with running ads, analyze results and iterate</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="events">3. Events</h4>
<p>There is a range of events from product launches to webinars that help in improving visibility.</p>
<p>A product launch, done right, puts us in front of the customers. It's not a sustainable stream of traffic but is good to get the word out.</p>
<p>Webinars are a great opportunity to educate people, results in content that we can use over and over. Gives facetime with customers and can be immensely valuable to them.</p>
<p>There are some other ways of becoming more discoverable e.g. PR, affiliates, influencer marketing etc. I am skipping going in detail about them right now.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. Building trust</h3>
<p>People buy stuff from the businesses that they trust. Trust is built by being honest, caring, listening, being vulnerable, showing proof/reviews/endorsements from others, being helpful and even seeking help.</p>
<p>Once potential customers discover our product, they are seeking reasons on how it solves their problem and why they should trust us.</p>
<p>On the internet, following are the ways to build trust.</p>
<h4>1. Landing page.</h4>
<p>Landing page is our opportunity to show that we understand their problem and have a solution. Show how the product solves their problems and how it has worked for others.</p>
<p>Potential customers want to feel resonance. Our copy should make them say - "Aah! this is exactly what I have been looking for." It's as if we were listening to their problem one-to-one. Make them feel listened to.</p>
<div>
<h5>Action steps</h5>
<ul>
<li>Deeply understand what the potential customer's pain points are and show how our product solves them. It makes them feel listened.</li>
<li>Make it easy for them to understand how our product works.</li>
<li>Make it look decent enough that it doesn't look spammy.</li>
<li>Make it easy for them to find and understand the exact details of our product.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>2. Email marketing</h4>
<p>Once a potential customer discovers us, they might like what they see but might not buy our product right away. At this point, we must offer them some value in exchange of their email. For e.g. an ebook, access to webinar etc.</p>
<p>We can use this email list to consistently educate, entertain, update and engage them.</p>
<p>It's all about providing value here. A good way to think about value here again is simply - educate or entertain them through emails.</p>
<h4>3. Take a stand</h4>
<p>Another good way of building trust is to take a stand. We must communicate what we stand for and do it emphatically.</p>
<p>It shows that we care for something larger than our business. That we are a vehicle of change and that we are fighting a status quo. It makes people passionate about what we are doing. They identify with the business more.</p>
<p>Good ways of doing this -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Run a campaign</span></p>
<p>Put a dedicated page on website on what we stand for and what we are doing to make the change happen.</p>
<p>A brilliant example of this is Patagonia, a clothing company, putting a <a href="https://wornwear.patagonia.com/">section of wornwear</a> on their website, to cut down consumption. It shows that they truly stand for the environment and the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Build a community</span></p>
<p>Build a space for people who care about the cause that we stand for, to come together and help each other. Build that townhall which brings people together under a roof, be a unifying force. It shows that we care for a change in the world and are willing to help people who want to participate in the change.</p>
<p>Building community they say is not a marketing strategy but a business strategy. We should do it because we really care for this particular cause deeply. It again shows that we have a soul as a business and actually care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<h5>Action steps</h5>
<ul>
<li>Come up with a strong "why". Craft a good, easy to remember message.</li>
<li>If we can afford to put time, money, energy into building a community. Do it.</li>
<li>If not, atleast write and talk about it. Have a dedicated section for it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>4. Show proof</h4>
<p>One of the most powerful tools in building trust is an endorsement. That is why word-of-mouth and product reviews work.</p>
<p>People trust referrals and endorsements and stories of success. Show testimonials, videos of how our product has helped others. </p>
<div>
<h5>Action steps</h5>
<ul>
<li>Write success stories. Put it on the landing page and it also doubles up as a piece of content that we can circulate.</li>
<li>Make videos of successful customers telling their story.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  
  
<hr>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>Let's apply the concepts above to AltCampus to decide what I need to do to play the marketing game.</p>
<div>
<h3>Improving reach</h3>
<h4>1. Content marketing</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p> I have a really good understanding still deeply understand and document what are the pain points of our customers. Talk to potential customers to do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I need to come up with the type of content, both media and topics, that would address those pain points. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Pull in resources to make sure that we can consistently produce quality content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Make a list of place where I should distribute the content in order to reach them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Ads</h4>
<p>We haven't thought about running ads. We are open to it but just not in our scheme of things right now.</p>
<h4>3. Events</h4>
<ul>
<li> Check the feasibility of running a webinar where we teach beginners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building trust</h3>
<h4>1. Improve landing page</h4>
<p>Our landing page - <a href="https://altcampus.school/">https://altcampus.school</a> looks decent and has basics in place so that's a good start. But that said, the current website doesn't show the solution of all the pain points that our target audience has.</p>
<p>We can do a better job of addressing some concerns like whether they have option of being in a batch or is it completely self-paced.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Ask for feedback from potential customers and outsiders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Clear ambiguity around batch vs self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Maybe have a explainer video on how the platform looks like and how training happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> We don't have a form to collect email addresses. Let's put it in there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Email marketing</h4>
<p>We send transactional mails but that's about it. We have close to 4k subscribers from our <a href="https://altcampus.io/">offline program website</a> but we haven't send a single newsletters yet. 🤦‍♂️ Obviously we need to fix that.</p>
<ul>
<li> Setup email marketing and send one email newsletter this week where we educate and update our subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Take a stand</h4>
<p>We know what we stand for. We stand for building a world full of skilled, employable people and help them be creators using the power of code. This doesn't seem super refined though. And because messaging is everything I need to work on this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Come up with a clear, crisp, easy to remember, and singular …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

September 21, 2020 | https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/example | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/example">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p><em>This post <a href="https://github.com/LightTag/sequence-labeling-with-transformers">comes with a repo</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our previous post on
<a href="https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/">aligning span annotations to Hugginface's tokenizer outputs</a>
discussed the various tradeoffs one needs to consider, and concluded that a windowing strategy over the tokenized text
and labels is optimal for our use cases. </p>
<p>This post demonstrates an end to end implementation of token alignment and windowing. We'll start by implementing
utility classes that make programming a little easier, then implement the alignment functionality which aligns offset
annotations to the out of a tokenizer. Finnaly we'll implement a PyTorch Dataset that stores our aligned tokens and
labels as windows, a Collator to implement batching and a simple DataLoader to be used in training. </p>
<p>We'll show and end to end flow on the DDI Corpus, recognizing pharmacological entities with BERT.</p>
<h2>Utility Classes For Convenient APIs</h2>
<p>We'll start by defining some types and utility classes that will make our work more convenient</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> typing_extensions <span>import</span> TypedDict
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List<span>,</span>Any
IntList <span>=</span> List<span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span> 
IntListList <span>=</span> List<span>[</span>IntList<span>]</span> </code></pre></div>

<h2>The Alignment Algorithm</h2>
<h3>FastTokenizers Simplify Alignment</h3>
<p>Recent versions of Hugginface's tokenizers library include variants of Tokenizers that end with Fast and inherit
from <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast">PreTrainedTokenizerFast</a><br>
such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#berttokenizerfast">BertTokenizerFast</a>
and <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html#gpt2tokenizerfast">GPT2TokenizerFast</a>. </p>
<p>Per the tokenizer's documentation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the tokenizer is a “Fast” tokenizer (i.e., backed by HuggingFace tokenizers library), [the output] provides in addition several advanced alignment methods which can be used to map between the original string (character and words) and the token space (e.g., getting the index of the token comprising a given character or the span of characters corresponding to a given token).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, the output provides the methods
<a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.BatchEncoding.token_to_chars">token<em>to</em>chars</a>
and <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.BatchEncoding.char_to_token">char<em>to</em>token</a>
which do exactly what their name implies, provide mappings between tokens and character offsets in the original text.
That's exactly what we need to align annotations in offset format with tokens.</p>
<h2>A warmup implementation</h2>
<p>Our final implementation will use the BIOUL scheme we mentioned before. But before we do that, let's try a simple
alignment to see what it feels like</p>

<h3>Accounting For Multi Token Annotations</h3>
<p>In the above example, some of our annotations spanned multiple tokens.
For instance "Tal Perry" spanned "Ta", "##l" and "Perry". Clearly by themselves none of those tokens are a Person, and
so our current alignment scheme isn't as useful as it could be.
To overcome that, we'll use the previously mentioned BIOLU scheme, which will indicate if a token is the beginning,
inside, last token in an annotation or if it is not part of an annotation or if it is perfectly aligned with an annotation.</p>

<h3>Mapping Labels To Ids</h3>
<p>It's great that we have our annotations aligned, but we need the labels as integer ids for training.
During inference, we'll also need a way to map predicted ids back to labels.
I'm going to make a custom class that handles that, called a LabelSet. </p>

<p>Now that we have alignment logic in place, we need to figure out how to load, batch and pad the data. We also need
to handle the case where our text is longer than we can feed our model. Below we show an implementation of a
particular strategy, windowing over uniform length segments of the text. This isn't the only strategy, or even
necessarily the best, but it fits our use case well. You can read more about
why <a href="https://www.lighttag.io/blog/sequence-labeling-with-transformers/">we use windowing when training ner models with BERT here</a>.
Below we'll just show how to do that.</p>
<h2>The Raw Dataset</h2>
<p>We'll be using the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046413001123">DDI Corpus</a>. You can download
a JSON verion of it  <a href="https://github.com/LightTag/DDICorpus">here</a>.

<h2>Padding and Windowing in a Dataset</h2>
<p>Our dataset is conveniently split into sentences. We still need to batch it and pad the examples.
More commonly, data is not split into sentences, and so we will window over fixed sized parts of it.
The windowing, padding and alignment logic will be done in a pytorch Dataset and we'll get to batching in a moment.</p>

September 21, 2020 | http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">

<p>λ● (pronounced “lambda-auth”) is a tool for generating secure “Authenticated Data Structure” protocols from simple specifications written in an ordinary programming language (OCaml).</p>

<p>The tool consists of a patched OCaml compiler, and is based on a programming language design presented at POPL 2014.</p>

<h2 id="whats-an-authenticated-data-structure">What’s an Authenticated Data Structure?</h2>

<p>Authenticated Data Structures (ADSs) are protocols for outsourcing data to untrusted parties. For example, suppose a Client doesn’t have much storage capacity (maybe it’s a mobile device) but can communicate with a powerful Server it doesn’t trust. With an ADS, the Client only has to store a tiny amount of data, yet is guaranteed that its queries are answered correctly.</p>

<p><img src="http://amiller.github.io/lambda-auth/assets/graphic.png">
</p>

<p>ADSs work by augmenting ordinary data structures with collision-resistant cryptographic hashes. </p>

<h2 id="example-binary-search-tree">Example: Binary Search Tree</h2>

<p>Creating an ADS protocol in λ● is as easy as writing an ordinary data structure program in OCaml. The following code (from <code>examples/bintree.ml</code>) is an example of membership lookup in an authenticated set of integers:</p>

<!--?prettify lang=ml?-->
<pre><code>let rec (member : 'auth tree -&gt; int -&gt; bool) x = function
  | Tip -&gt; false
  | Bin a -&gt; let (l,y,r) = (fun x -&gt; unauth x) a in
      if x = y then true else if x &lt; y
      then member x l
      else member x r &lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The only non-standard syntax is the <code>'auth</code> type operator and <code>unauth</code> keywords, which are used to provide hints on where to compress the data structure by applying hashes. The λ● compiler automatically generates executables for both the Client and the Server from this single piece of input code.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-examples">Running the examples</h2>

<p>Get the most recent version of λ● from github:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/amiller/lambda-auth
</code></pre>

<p>To run the examples, you will first need a copy of ocaml (trunk) installed, and the source directory should be located in the previous directory as <code>../ocaml-trunk</code>.</p>

<p>Next, run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ make                   # Builds the compiler
$ make prover            # Builds the prover examples
$ make verifier          # Builds the verifier examples
</code></pre>

<p><span size="-1"><em><b>WARNING Although the topic here is secure software, this is a research prototype, it has not been audited, and you should not use it in production for anything serious.</b></em></span>

        <section>
            <div><p>TLS certificates are offered for free by LetsEncrypt and cert-manager, a popular tool from Jetstack makes the management and renewal automatic. The tooling changes often and even experienced Kubernetes users find the process confusing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Updated: September 2020 - to include ingress-nginx rename, and inlets-operator to run these instructions at home or on-premises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/ed2c0e0b3df1d10c3ad219348ed7b1ba56771655/logo/logo.svg?sanitize=true" width="200px"></p>
<p>For that reason there is <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/">documentation on the OpenFaaS website</a> for how to configure a TLS certificate for your OpenFaaS Gateway. Once in place, traffic between your users and your Kubernetes cluster is encrypted.</p>
<p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27013154?s=200&amp;v=4" width="200px"></p>
<p>Today I'll show you how to bootstrap everything from scratch on a managed Kubernetes service using the OSS <code>arkade</code> tool.</p>
<h3 id="provisionyourkubernetescluster">Provision your Kubernetes cluster</h3>
<p>You can provision a cluster wherever you want, whether that be Google Kubernetes Engine, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, AWS EKS or somewhere else.</p>
<p>I suggest you create a cluster with DigitalOcean since it's fast, cheap, and a fully managed cluster. Once you have everything working, move on to your preferred choice for your company or team.</p>
<p>Product page for: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/">DOKS</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a cluster in your preferred region with around 2-4GB RAM total and at least 2x vCPUs.</li>
<li>Download your KUBECONFIG file and run <code>export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/kube.config</code> (replace the path with the actual name)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getarkade">Get arkade</h3>
<p><code>arkade</code> can be used to install <code>apps</code> to Kubernetes clusters. The way an <code>app</code> is installed is by using its <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm</a> chart to generate YAML manifest files and then apply them. This process bypasses <code>tiller</code> completely, something which will be <a href="https://v3.helm.sh/">deprecated in helm 3</a>.</p>
<p>Install arkade, which is a Kubernetes app installer.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh
sudo install arkade /usr/local/bin/

arkade --help
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installnginxingresscontroller">Install nginx IngressController</h3>
<p>We need an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">IngressController</a> to use with cert-manager, so let's install <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">nginx-ingress</a>.</p>
<pre><code>arkade install ingress-nginx
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installcertmanager">Install cert-manager</h3>
<pre><code>arkade install cert-manager
</code></pre>
<p>This command installs <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">JetStack's cert-manager</a> using the helm chart, but without <code>tiller</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installopenfaas">Install openfaas</h3>
<pre><code>arkade install openfaas
</code></pre>
<p>This command <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">installs OpenFaaS</a> using the helm chart, but without <code>tiller</code>. Try the output given by arkade to check the installation worked correctly.</p>
<h3 id="areyouonpubliccloud">Are you on public cloud?</h3>
<p>If you're running in your homelab, on-premises or with a Raspberry Pi cluster, then it's likely that you don't have a Public IP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before creating an IP forwarding rule on your router, remember that you are exposing your location and ISP information to the world, there's a better way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get a public IP for ingress-nginx through inlets PRO and the inlets-operator:</p>
<pre><code>arkade install inlets-operator \
 --helm3 \
 --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --token-file ~/Downloads/digitalocean-api-key \
 --license-file ~/Downloads/inlets-pro-license.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The inlets-operator will create a public IP for you, and you can continue as if you were running on Public Cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get a <a href="https://inlets.dev/">free trial or purchase inlets PRO here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="configureyouringress">Configure your Ingress</h3>
<p>Let's say that you have a domain called <code>example.com</code>. If you don't have a domain yet, just buy one from Google Domains or from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a>. They start at under 2 USD, so there is no reason not to.</p>
<p>We'll use a sub-domain of <code>openfaas</code> so the full address would be: <code>openfaas.example.com</code>.</p>
<pre><code>export TOP_DOMAIN=example.com
export DOMAIN=openfaas.$TOP_DOMAIN

export EMAIL=webmaster@$DOMAIN
arkade install openfaas-ingress \
 --domain $DOMAIN \
 --email $EMAIL
</code></pre>
<p>This creates an Issuer with your email address and an Ingress record, which cert-manager will use to create your TLS certificate automatically.</p>
<h3 id="updateyourdnsrecord">Update your DNS record</h3>
<p>In order for the certificate to be issued, your new LoadBalancer created for Nginx needs to point at the domain name you used in the previous step i.e. <code>echo $DOMAIN</code>.</p>
<p>Now find the IP with <code>kubectl get svc</code> - you'll see Nginx has an EXTERNAL-IP.</p>
<ul>
<li>For EKS create a DNS CNAME record for the DNS entry given</li>
<li>For all other cluster create a DNS A record with the IP given</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the DigitalOcean CLI installed <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl">doctl</a> then you can run:</p>
<pre><code>export IP="" # populate from above
doctl compute domain create $DOMAIN --ip-address $IP
</code></pre>
<h3 id="waitalittle">Wait a little</h3>
<p>You now need to wait for your DNS entry to propagate and for cert-manager to obtain a certificate.</p>
<p>Check how things are going with:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl logs deploy/cert-manager -n cert-manager -f
</code></pre>
<h3 id="logintoopenfaaswithtls">Log-in to OpenFaaS with TLS</h3>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=https://$DOMAIN

PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)

echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login -s

faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo
faas-cli list -v

faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>You can also open the OpenFaaS UI over an encrypted connection:</p>
<pre><code>echo Open a browser at https://$DOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-25-at-14.12.43.png" alt="Screenshot-2019-10-25-at-14.12.43"></p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>When I proposed that <code>arkade</code> should configure TLS for OpenFaaS in a single command, it was because I wanted to make the whole process less painful and repetitive, and to guard users from the many breaking changes we've seen in cert-manager over the course of the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I think I achieved that aim, but make up your own mind. Compare the following with the single line we typed in above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full docs: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/">Add TLS to OpenFaaS with cert-manager</a></li>

<p>Interest in OpenFaaS and <code>arkade</code> is growing rapidly, so for me it's even more important that users have easy access to TLS certificates to encrypt their traffic.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see new "apps" (helm charts) supported in arkade, then let me know on the GitHub repository <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">https://get-arkade.dev</a> and add your ⭐️ to show support.</p>

</span></p><p>It’s my responsibility to hire Python developers. If you have a GitHub account, I will check it out. Everyone does it. Maybe you don’t know, but your playground project with zero stars can help you to get that job offer.</p>
<p>The same goes for your take-home test task. You heard this, when we meet a person for the first time, we make the first impression in 30 seconds, and this biases the rest of our judgment. I find it uncomfortably unfair that beautiful people get everything easier than the rest of us. The same bias applies to the code. You look at the project, and something immediately catches your eye. Leftovers of the old code in the repo, like leftovers of your breakfast in your beard, can ruin everything. You may not have a beard, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Usually, it’s easy to see when it’s a beginner’s code. Below, I provide some tricks to fool recruiters like me and increase your chances of passing to the next interview level. Don’t feel bad if you think like you’re gaming the system, because you are not. Applying these little improvements to your code not only increases your chances to succeed at the interview, but you also become a better developer. Which I can’t tell for drilling focusing on memorizing algorithms or modules of the standard library.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between a beginner and a more experienced developer? Beginners did not work with the legacy codebase, and they don’t see value in investing in a maintainable solution. Quite often, they work alone and equally, they don’t care much about the readability.</p>
<p><strong>Your goal is to show that you care about the readability and maintainability of your solution.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s see what we can do to improve the quality of your Python project. These tips make your code better, and if you don’t cargo-cult them, they also make you a better developer.</p>
<p><strong>1. Declutter the repo</strong><br>
Open your repo page on GitHub. Do you have <code>.idea</code>, <code>.vscode</code>, <code>.DS_Store</code> or <code>*.pyc</code> files? Have you committed your virtualenv there? Remove them now, and add files and directories to the gitignore. The rule of thumb is to avoid keeping in the codebase anything that you haven’t created yourself. There is a good <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore">tutorial from Atlassian</a> to know more about gitignore and what to ignore in general.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>✅ A minimal gitignore example for the Python project</strong><br>
A good starting point for the <code>.gitignore</code>. Add it to your repository in the first place.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span><span>12
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="fallback">*.pyc
*.egg-info

# If you're on Mac
.DS_Store

# If you have a habit of creating a virtual environment
# inside the project, as I do
/env

# Configuration and secrets (see an example in the next section)
/.env
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For a bigger gitignore, use <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore">the one from the GitHub’s collection</a> as a stargting point and a source of the inspiration.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>2. No passwords in the code</strong><br>
No passwords to the databases, API keys to external services, or secret keys for encryption in the repo! Move the secrets to configuration files or environment variables, or read them from the secret store, and never commit them to the codebase. The 12-factor guide is an excellent and always relevant read, and its advice about <a href="https://12factor.net/config">configs</a> is on-point.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>🚫 Database requisites in the code</strong><br>
It’s a snippet from a Flask application where the author keeps the database requisites in the code.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> Flask

app <span>=</span> Flask(__name__)
app<span>.</span>config[<span>"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>] <span>=</span> <span>"postgresql://user:secret@localhost:5432/my_db"</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p><strong>✅ Database requisites in environment</strong><br>
Moving requisites to the environment is quite straightforward.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5

app<span>.</span>config[<span>"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>] <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now, before starting the application, you need to initialize the environment.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI</span><span>=</span>postgresql://user:secret@localhost:5432/my_db
flask run
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p><strong>✅ Database requisites in the .env file</strong><br>
To avoid initializing the environment from your console, take a step further and include your requisites in a file <code>.env</code>. Install the package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/">python-dotenv</a> and initialize your environment right from the Python code.</p>
<p>That’s how the <code>.env</code> would look like</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="fallback">SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:secret@localhost:5432/my_db
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Reading this file from your application looks like this:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

load_dotenv()

app <span>=</span> Flask(__name__)
app<span>.</span>config[<span>"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>] <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Don’t forget to add the path to your <code>.env</code> file to <code>.gitignore</code> so that you don’t commit it accidentally.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>3. Have a README</strong><br>
Have a top-level README with the purpose of your project, installation instructions, and the quick start guide. If you don’t know what to write there, follow the <a href="https://www.makeareadme.com/">Make a README</a> guideline.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>✅ A sample README for a Python project</strong><br>
As suggested by the “Make a README” resource, include in the README installation and usage instructions. The example below also includes contributing guidelines and a license, which is crucial for an open-source project.</p>

<p><strong>4. If you use third-party libraries, have a requirements.txt</strong><br>
If your project requires third-party dependencies, declare them explicitly. The simplest way is to create a requirements.txt file in the top-level directory, one dependency per line. Don’t forget to add an instruction to use requirements.txt to the README. Read more about the file in the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files">pip user guide</a></p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>✅ A sample requirements.txt for a Flask application</strong><br>
Adding requirements.txt to the root of your project is the simplest way of keeping track of project dependencies. Optionally, you can define the version constraints for them.</p>
<p><em>requirements.txt</em></p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="fallback">gunicorn
Flask&gt;=1.1
Flask-SQLAlchemy
psycopg2
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p><strong>✅ A more elaborated example with requirements.in</strong><br>
It’s always good to have a reproducible environment. Even if a new library comes out, you keep using the old battle-tested version until you explicitly decide to upgrade the version. It’s called “dependency pinning” and the easiest way to advance with it is to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/">pip-tools</a>. There, you have two files: requirements.in and requirements.txt. You never modify the latter by hand, but you commit it along with requirements.in.</p>
<p>Here’s the source file <em>requirements.in</em>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1

<p><strong>5. Format your code with black</strong><br>
Inconsistent formatting doesn’t prevent your code from working. Still, formatted code makes your code easier to read and to maintain. Fortunately, code formatting can and should be automated. If you use VSCode, it suggests installing “black”, an automatic source code formatter for Python, and reformats your code on save. Also, you can install <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and do the same from the console.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>🚫 Unformatted code</strong><br>

<span>"goose"</span>:<span>'geese'</span>,<span>'phenomena'</span> : <span>'phenomenon'</span>   }
    <span>if</span> word <span>in</span> exceptions :
        <span>return</span> exceptions [ word ]
    <span>return</span> word<span>+</span><span>'s'</span>

    <span>import</span> <span>sys</span>
    <span>print</span> ( pluralize ( sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>1</span>] ) )
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p><strong>✅ The same code, formatted with black</strong><br>
Black guarantees that the code keeps the same functionality. It only saves you from the mental burden of manually following the same formatting guideline.</p>

<p><strong>6. Remove unused imports</strong><br>
Unused imports are usually left hanging in the codebase after some experiments and refactoring. If you don’t use a module anymore, don’t forget to remove it from the file. Editors usually highlight unused imports, making them an easy target.</p>
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p><strong>🚫 Unused imports</strong><br>
The import “os” is not used.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p><strong>✅ No unused imports</strong><br>
Well, that is trivial.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>7. Remove unused variables</strong><br>
The same goes for unused variables. You may have them because you followed the flow and though that a variable will be useful later on, but it turned out to be never used in the first place.</p>

September 21, 2020 | https://www.underkube.com/posts/2020-09-21-gnome-displays-argos/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.underkube.com/posts/2020-09-21-gnome-displays-argos/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body"><p>I wanted to easily switch between my regular desktop configuration:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/00-standard.jpg" alt="standard"></p><p>All the external displays:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/01-externals.jpg" alt="externals"></p><p>To a single external display:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/02-external-horizontal.jpg" alt="single-external"></p><p>Or just the laptop screen:
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/03-laptop.jpg" alt="laptop"></p><p>This usually required to open <code>gnome-control-center</code>, then click displays, etc.
<img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/gnome-control-center.png" alt="gnome-control-center"></p><p>So I thought it would be nice to look for a extension in the
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">Gnome Extensions</a> site… but I couldn’t find
any that worked as I wanted… so let’s try to do our own method! :)</p><h2 id="argos">Argos</h2><p>Just in case you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/argos">Argos</a>, it is a
Gnome ‘metaextension’ where you can create your own extensions based on scripts,
commands, etc. It is inspired by, and fully compatible with, the
<a href="https://github.com/matryer/bitbar">BitBar</a> app for OSX.</p><p>In order to install it, you just need to go to its
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1176/argos/">the Gnome Extensions</a> page
and click on the “ON|OFF” button. Profit!</p><p>There are plenty of examples and useful argos/bitbar scripts out there so my
recomendation is to look for ‘prior art’ to inspire yourself on creating your
own extensions.</p><h2 id="xorg-or-wayland">Xorg or Wayland?</h2><p>I use Xorg instead of Wayland because I couldn’t find an alternative to
<code>xbindkeys</code> for Wayland to customize my
<a href="https://www.logitech.com/es-es/product/mx-master-2s-flow">MX Master 2S</a> mouse
keys. See
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Logitech_MX_Master#Xbindkeys">here</a> for
more information on how to do that, but basically, this is my <code>~/.xbindkeysrc</code>:</p><pre><code># thumb wheel up =&gt; increase volume
"xte 'key XF86AudioRaiseVolume'"
   b:8

# thumb wheel down =&gt; lower volume
"xte 'key XF86AudioLowerVolume'"
   b:9
</code></pre><h2 id="enter-xrandr-and-arandr">Enter xrandr and arandr</h2><p>tl;dr.- <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr"><code>xrandr</code></a> is a cli tool to
manage displays using xorg while
<a href="https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/">arandr</a> is a nice GUI tool to
create <code>xrandr</code> “scripts” easily:</p><p><img src="https://www.underkube.com/images/gnome-displays-argos/arandr.png" alt="arandr screenshot"></p><p>Basically it generates <code>sh</code> scripts such as <code>~/.screenlayout/00-standard.sh</code>:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 3000x420 --rotate normal --output DP-1 --off --output HDMI-1 --off --output DP-2 --off --output HDMI-2 --off --output DP-1-1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x420 --rotate normal --output DP-1-2 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0 --rotate left --output DP-1-3 --off
</code></pre><p>So I have a script for each of my setups:</p><pre><code>$ ls -1 ~/.screenlayout/
00-standard.sh
01-single-external.sh
02-only-external.sh
03-laptop.sh
04-vertical.sh
</code></pre><h2 id="argos-extension">Argos extension</h2><p>With everything in place, the argos extension is just this
<code>~/.config/argos/external_monitor.1r..sh</code> script:</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "|iconName=video-display"
echo "---"

Mobile screen grab from Latvian national archive</p></div>


<p>From 2019 onwards the Latvian National Archive offers access to various KGB documents. The author had already previously shown the very detailed efforts of the Latvian KGB counterintelligence to monitor and study the CIA and BND numbers stations broadcasts, or what they called – “one directional communications”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These are one of the most definitive archival sources which prove that foreign intelligence actively used shortwave in the USSR and that the KGB was aware of it. The documents showed that the KGB had monitored these broadcasts from at least 1978, but the files spoke very vaguely if the monitoring effort led to any apprehension and capture of a foreign agent. We, however, know that there were such cases like Alexander Ogorodnik<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and others where the use of shortwave signals was determined.</p>
<p>The Latvian National Archive digitized operational cases and also special KGB training manuals. These manuals were published for inner agency use and were never issued in public because they contained secret information. One such manual called “<em>Некоторые вопросы организаций работы по сигналам и делам оперативного учета лиц причастий в шпионажу”</em> published in 1985 by KGB of F. E Dzherzhinsky in Moscow.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (A few issues on organizing work on signals and cases recognizing persons taking part in espionage”). The manual was credited to major general A. A Fabrichinikov and colonel V.V Holopov The word “signal” in the title does not mean just a radio signal. In the KGB terminology “signal” meant a sign or report of a foreign intelligence or anti Soviet activity. If this “signal” indicated that the person is taking part in espionage he had to be investigated and evidence to be collected. The manual showed various historical cases as examples on how to apprehend and capture a foreign agent.</p>



<p>One such case was called” Case on Filatov”. Starting from page 41 the manual examples this case as one of the cases where radio communication was used between the agency and agent and how it was uncovered by counter intelligence. <strong>Anatoly N. Filatov</strong> was according to a 1981 Washington Post report sentenced in 1978 to be shot by a firing squad, though the sentence was commuted later to 15 years in prison.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> A New York Times article in 1980 had rumored that A. Filatov was the same “Trigon” who is now commonly known as Alexandr Ogorodnik. The article states that A. Filatov was suspected of being discovered by the KGB counterintelligence and forced to send the CIA false information. The reasoning behind this hypothesis was that in 1977 “Trigon” went dark at the same time as A. Filatov sent a very questionable cable about Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, where he questioned the “bargaining position of president Carter” during the 1977 missile control talks.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Alexander Ogorodnik aka “Trigon” died on June 22 1977 after swallowing cyanide pills during a KGB break in.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>David E. Hoffman, author of the book “The Million Dollar Spy” states that Filatov was arrested during a “car toss”, where a package is quickly swapped between two passing cars.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Russian author Aleksandr Kolpakidi in his book “The GRU Empire” writes that Filatov was born in 1940 in the Saratov district, joined the GRU in 1973. (GRU – the Main Intelligence Directorate – Soviet military intelligence agency) and served in Algiers where in 1974 he established contact with the CIA. Filatov had stated that his involvement with the adversary CIA happened as a result of being lured into a honey trap with a woman called Nadia, as similar happened to&nbsp; A. Ogorodnik. Either so or A. Filatov himself decided to become a double agent and started meeting CIA agent Edward Kane. In 1976 A. Filatov was called back to Moscow and the CIA had instructed him to receive shortwave coded broadcasts in German numbers from Frankfurt near Main, the broadcasts were to be carried out twice a week. Operative broadcast would be started with uneven numbers and training with even numbers. The broadcasts on precaution were carried out before A. Filatov returned to Moscow. The return message was to be carried out in a dead drop in an area near Dinamo sports stadium.</p>
<p>As the author states the coded messages contained such instructions: “Do not contain yourself with gathering information within your service only. Gain trust of friends and relatives. Visit them at their workplaces, their homes, invite them to restaurants, and with careful, clever talking gain information you could not get yourself”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. The instructions also stated that the agency is not just interested in documents with “Top Secret” on it but also common information about his department and situation in it. Filatov was arrested on the 2nd of September 1977. As A. Kolpakidi states he was first sentenced to death in 1978 but instead was sent to labor camp 389/35 near Perm. In 1989 Filatov was visited by French journalists to whom he stated that he took very high stakes risks in his life which he lost and now naturally pays for it.</p>
<p>After release he demanded compensation from the US embassy, but was denied as a non citizen. The Russian TV company TV Center in 2014 made the documentary series “Завербуй меня, если сможешь” (Contract me if you can) and featured the A. Filatov case showing various pictures of him and accounts from his colleagues, such as Anatoly Tereshchenko, colonel of the military counter intel. Tereshchenko stated that if A. Filatov had come to the GRU and reported that he was lured into cooperation with the CIA, they could outplay the CIA, and Filatov would be a hero.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> What became of Filatov after his release, is not known, the TV documentary showed his picture after his release. Possibly A. Filatov is dead now.</p>

<p>The case regarding American agent Filatov is particularly useful for agency and operative workers. Two agents who worked on this case had limited, but clear objectives: one controlled his work shifts, the other one lured him to a position within a GRU object (facility), where he was arrested. Secondary events were mostly carried out by the workers of the operational staff.</p>
<p>In the case materials the use of operational technical and criminal resources is very clearly displayed. The workers of the operational services had a clear objective: gain information about practical espionage activity.</p>
<p>A lot of support for apprehending the spy was provided by the GRU radio counterintelligence. During the first phase of the operation the counter radio intelligence played a helpful, but mostly backseat role, in terms of gaining radio information. However, after Filatov was discovered in possession of multiple ciphers the RCI<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> played the most active role in gaining information about the adversary’s plans for their agent. It must be asserted that the RCI data about the new communication line only gained importance after comprehensive analysis about known agents and data gained from agency postal communication lines.</p>
<p>It is useful to take note of the surveillance tactics used to monitor&nbsp; FIlatov, during all phases of the operation. Here the artistic use of surveillance, determination of the personality of the object, working out on his work conditions and living place (such an approach is essential for any future attempts for apprehending an adversary agent).</p>
<p>Finally it’s important to point out the very high level of secrecy is required to successfully&nbsp; carry out the operation, with minimal numbers&nbsp; of agents and operative staff workers as reglamented by the authority of KGB, and adjusted fully to the set parameters.</p>
<p>All this taken to an account assured that the case was carried out in highest quality the tasks were carried out decisively.</p>
<p>“””</p>
<p>The investigation into the incoming signals, and the timeline for the search for the CIA agent Filatov took place in the following order.</p>
<p>At the start of 1977 the second chief directorate of the KGB had received data that led to the belief that a new agent from American intelligence had become active within Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On January 21 and February 6 1977 the RCI had detected the transmission of operational (combat)<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> radiograms on the communication line sent from Frankfurt CIA radio center, that had appeared already in the first half of 1976.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> With that the general reception of the radiograms was possible within the central part of European side of the USSR. <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
<p>In this same timeframe espionage activity within CIA station inside the US embassy in Moscow, was observed to have increased, showing signs of preparing for creating operational dead drop communications, it was determined that these activities could not be part of the ongoing cases and operational games.</p>
<p>It was expected that the agent, after receiving operational radiograms, will likely make contact with the Frankfurt radio center using postal telegraph, telephone, dead drop, radio transmission or make a meeting with his handler, usually from US diplomatic service.</p>
<p>Taking this into account together with Operative-technical and Seventh authority of the KGB, extra measures were made to control the agency channels within Moscow and eavesdrop on CIA actions.</p>
<p>On February 9 1977 a postal parcel coming from Moscow to the US, a suspicious letter was identified which had signs which made its purpose likely being for espionage uses. This letter had a date indicating it was sent on February 7 and was written in the in English language “from English tourist”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. By using a physical-chemical method on the blank side of the letter, a cipher of 353 five number …</p></div></div>

			<h2>IoT Security Certificate: From the Internet of Things to the Internet of Trouble</h2>
<p>It all began with a couple of programmers that just wanted a cold Coke.</p>
<p>In 1982 computer science researchers at Carnegie Mellon University finally got fed up with making their way up three flights of stairs to find a vending machine that was sold out or – worse than that – buying a recently refilled soda only to find it was warm. To overcome their challenges, the programmers attached temperature switches to the machine and added connectivity that allowed anyone on the Carnegie Mellon network to know if there was Coke, and whether it was cold.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) was born.</p>
<p>Of course, it took until 1999 for someone to put that name to these sorts of connected devices, and another ten years for these devices to outnumber actual human users of the internet. Since then, the IoT has continued to explode and today there are estimated to be more than 35 billion connected devices worldwide. Everyone from consumers looking to turn down their lights to industrial users looking to turn up their productivity have embraced the IoT, and the march of the connected device world seems unstoppable.</p>
<p>Or at least it did.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020 alarm bells rang out regarding a major problem facing the world of IoT, one that had roots almost as far back as that Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon.<br>
So, what could bring IoT crashing down? IoT security certificates.</p>
<h2>IoT security certificates: The Root of the Problem</h2>
<p>An IoT security certificate is something like a personal identity card or passport. Just as your identity card or passport assures someone that you are who you say you are, a security certificate assures that the device is what it purports to be.</p>
<p>With an identity card or a passport, there is a single entity issuing the document, usually a national government. With a security certificate, however, there is more than a single issuing authority and, indeed, there is more than a single IoT security certificate for each website or device.</p>

			<p>These certificates together form what is called a <a href="https://www.fir3net.com/Security/Concepts-and-Terminology/pki-chain-of-trust.html">chain of trust</a> and anyone familiar with a website running HTTPS, for example, would know that their security certificate regularly needs to be updated. As of September 2020, the longest lifetime for such a certificate will be one year meaning that website owners will need to update their certificates at least annually.</p>
<p>Yet beyond the browsable web, all other internet-enabled devices have their own certificates, too. A sensor on a machine in a factory, a connected medical device, even connected children’s toys all have IoT security certificates that must be valid for the device to function correctly.</p>
<p>But while updating or replacing a certificate for an individual website or device is one thing, it’s quite another when the root certificate expires. Being core to thousands or even millions of devices, these root certificates don’t require annual updating but they do still expire.</p>
<p>And when they do, there’s trouble waiting.</p>
<h3>May 30 10:48:38 2020 GMT</h3>
<p>A couple of months back the world got a taste of what happens when a root certificate authority expires.</p>
<p>A little before lunchtime in London on 30 May, the AddTrust External CA Root expired, and the turmoil began. As a result, security researcher <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/impending-doom-root-ca-expiring-legacy-clients/">Scott Helme</a> reported, IoT video streaming device Roku started losing access to some channels, global payment processor Stripe ran into issues, and competitor payment processor Spreedly was unable to process payments, too.</p>
<p>The underlying cause of these problems and the problems experienced by hundreds of other device makers and companies was the expiration of the root certificate authority. Without it, all of the intermediate and end-entity certificates associated with that root CA just don’t matter. Unless device manufacturers or he millions of end users update their devices, broken they will stay.</p>
<p>But this was just a preview.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/10/iot_trouble_root_certificates_expire/">The Register</a> reported, we’re approaching a point in time now where there are lots of CA Root Certificates expiring in the next few years simply because it’s been 20+ years since the encrypted web really started up and that’s the lifetime of a Root CA certificate. If manufacturers continue to churn out IoT devices and products without thinking about the implications of an about-to-expire CA root certificate, the internet of things might quickly turn to an internet of trouble.</p>
<h3>Not All Doom and Gloom</h3>
<p>There is hope, though.</p>
<p>Indeed, the two-step solution is relatively simple to explain, if a little more complex to put into action.</p>
<p><strong>Step One involves pushing a firmware update to all impacted IoT devices.</strong> Pushing updated firmware with a certificate security chain that won’t expire in the short term is essential to maintaining device uptime and continuing to meet customer expectations for reliability, robustness, and quality. For some devices with a relatively short lifecycle, a well-constructed firmware update like this will be enough to avert problems altogether, at least for the useful and supported life of the device.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two involves taking steps to ensure this doesn’t become a problem again in the future.</strong> A dedicated software tool to manage the device IDs of a company’s IoT network would be ideal here. Not only would it keep track of the device, its IoT security certificate status, and highlight when that device is poised to enter a potentially unsecure period, it could also be used as part of the wider effort to manage the lifecycle of the company devices.</p>
<p>The first step is really the minimum that any conscientious organization is going to want to take, but it’s no panacea all on its own. The chain of trust system and the limitations on certificate validation periods mean it’s little more than a temporary stopgap.</p>
<p>The second step is aimed less at getting out of troublesome situations than at avoiding them altogether. With so many devices using so many certificates about to expire in the next few years, the time to start planning ahead is now.</p>
<p>As we approach the forty-year anniversary of the first somewhat-connected vending machine, the tens of billions of connected devices that now populate the planet are increasingly at threat from the very security that they hoped would protect. As CA Root certificates approach their expiration dates, entire IoT networks – industrial, consumer, in the factory and in the home – are at risk.</p>
<p>Reports note that the next major date on which a large number of root certificates will expire is <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/smart-home-cert-disaster">30 September 2021</a>. With just over a year to go, the time to act is now.</p>

		<em>The software industry loves young people, but old-timers serve an important purpose, too.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Our culture idolises youth. There's several reasons for this, I believe. Youth seems synonymous with vigour, strength, beauty, and many other desirable qualities. The cynical perspective is that young people, while rebellious, also tend to be easy to manipulate, if you know which buttons to push. A middle-aged man like me isn't susceptible to the argument that I should buy a particular pair of Nike shoes because they're named after Michael Jordan, but for a while, one pair wasn't enough for my teenage daughter.
	</p>
	<p>
		In intellectual pursuits (like software development), youth is often extolled as the source of innovation. You're often confronted with examples like that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a>, who made all his discoveries before turning 21. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> was around 28 years when she produced what is considered the 'first computer program'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> was 24 when he wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, young age is no detriment to making ground-breaking contributions. It has even become folklore that everyone past the age of 35 is a has-been whose only chance at academic influence is to write a textbook.

		The story of the five monkeys <a href="#800321a74c054ea0b75815c86f4ce18d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You may have seen a story called <em>the five monkeys experiment</em>. It's most likely a fabrication, but it goes like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		A group of scientists placed five monkeys in a cage, and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on the top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others would beat it up.
	</p>
	<p>
		After some time, none of the monkeys dared go up the ladder regardless of the temptation. The scientists then substituted one of the monkeys with a new one, who'd immediately  go for the bananas, only to be beaten up by the others. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder even though it never knew why.
	</p>
	<p>
		A second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated in beating the second. A third monkey was exchanged and the story repeated. The fourth was substituted and the beating was repeated. Finally the fifth monkey was replaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		Left was a group of five monkeys who, even though they never received a cold shower, continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder. If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they would beat up all who attempted to go up the ladder, the answer would probably be:
	</p>
	<p>
		"That's how we do things here."
	</p>
	<p>
		While the story is probably just that: a story, it tells us something about the drag induced by age and experience. If you've been in the business for decades, you've seen numerous failed attempts at something you yourself tried when you were young. You know that it can't be done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Young people don't know that a thing can't be done. If they can avoid the monkey-beating, they'll attempt the impossible.

	<p>
		Is attempting the impossible a good idea?
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, no, because it's... impossible. There's a reason older people tell young people that a thing can't be done. It's not just because they're stodgy conservatives who abhor change. It's because they see the effort as wasteful. Perhaps they're even trying to be kind, guiding young people off a path where only toil and disappointment is to be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		What old people don't realise is that sometimes, circumstances change.
	</p>
	<p>
		What was impossible twenty years ago may not be impossible today. We see this happening in many fields. Producing a commercially viable electric car was impossible for decades, until, with the advances made in battery technology, it became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technology changes rapidly in software development. People trying something previously impossible may find that it's possible today. Once, if you had lots of data, you had to store it in fully normalised form, because storage was expensive. For a decade, relational databases were the only game in town. Then circumstances changed. Storage became cheaper, and a new movement of NoSQL storage emerged. What was before impossible became possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Older people often don't see the new opportunities, because they 'know' that some things are impossible. Young people push the envelope driven by a combination of zest and ignorance. Most fail, but a few succeed.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4272a069588e47f796646bd282b9de02">
		Lottery of the impossible <a href="#4272a069588e47f796646bd282b9de02" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I think of this process as a lottery. Imagine that every impossible thing is a red ball in an urn. Every young person who tries the impossible draws a random ball from the urn.
	</p>
	<p>
		The urn contains millions of red balls, but every now and then, one of them turns green. You don't know which one, but if you draw it, it represents something that was previously impossible which has now become possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		This process produces growth, because once discovered, the new and better way of doing things can improve society in general. Occasionally, the young discoverer may even gain some fame and fortune.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems wasteful, though. Most people who attempt the impossible will reach the predictable conclusion. What was deemed impossible was, indeed, impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm in a cynical mood, I don't think that it's youth in itself that is the source of progress. It's just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> applied. If there's a one in million chance that something will succeed, but ten million people attempt it, it's only a matter of time before one succeeds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Society at large can benefit from the success of the few, but ten million people still wasted their efforts.
	</p>
	<h3 id="016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db">
		We need the old, too <a href="#016744f0ea77495c958a7914f08187db" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you accept the argument that young people are more likely to try the impossible, we need the young people. Do we need the old people?
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm turning fifty in 2020. You may consider that old, but I expect to work for many more years. I don't know if the software industry needs fifty-year-olds, but that's not the kind of old I have in mind. I'm thinking of people who have retired, or are close to retirement.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our youth-glorifying culture, we tend to dismiss the opinion and experiences of old people. <em>Oh, well, it's just a codgy old man</em> (or woman), we'll say.
	</p>
	<p>
		We ignore the experience of the old, because we believe that they haven't been keeping up with times. Their experiences don't apply to us, because we live under new circumstance. Well, see above.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not advocating that we turn into a gerontocracy that venerates our elders solely because of their age. Again, according to the law of large numbers, some people live to old age. There need not be any correlation between survivors and wisdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need the old to tell us the truth, because they have little to lose.
	</p>
	<h3 id="8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a">
		Nothing to lose <a href="#8b5c613ba6c44bb4b4e6dbba7ae7d19a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In the last couple of years, I've noticed a trend. A book comes out, exposing the sad state of affairs in some organisation. This has happened regularly in Denmark, where I live. One book may expose the deplorable conditions of the Danish tax authorities, one may describe the situation in the ministry of defence, one criticises the groupthink associated with the climate crisis, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Invariably, it turns out that the book is written by a professor emeritus or a retired department head.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think that these people, all of a sudden, had an epiphany after they retired. They knew all about the rot in the system they were part of, while they were part of it, but they've had too much to lose. You could argue that they should have said something before they retired, but that requires a moral backbone we can't expect most people to have.
	</p>
	<p>
		When people retire, the threat of getting fired disappears. Old people can speak freely to a degree most other people can't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Granted, many may simply use that freedom to spew bile or shout <em>Get off my lawn!</em>, but many are in the unique position to reveal truths no-one else dare speak. Many are, perhaps, just bitter, but some may possess knowledge that they are in a unique position to reveal.
	</p>
	<p>
		When that grumpy old guy on Twitter writes something that makes you uncomfortable, consider this: he may still be right.
	</p>
	<h3 id="2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e">
		Being unreasonable <a href="#2d64bd2c7ccb4b7ca2418802ed82689e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		In a way, you could say that we need young and old people for the same fundamental reason. Not all of them, but enough of them, are in a position to be unreasonable.
		</p><blockquote>
			<p>
				"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
			</p>
			
		</blockquote><p>
		Young people and old people are unreasonable in each their own way, and we need both.
	</p>
	<h3 id="df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2">
		Conclusion <a href="#df88f595ec814e2bafcbd018ff5f5ad2" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		We need young people in the software development industry. Because of their vigour and inexperience, they'll push the envelope. Most will fail to do the impossible, but a few succeed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This may seem like a cynical view, but we've all been young, and most of us have been through such a phase. It's like a rite of passage, and even if you fail to make your mark on the world, you're still likely to have learned a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		We need old people because they're in a position to speak truth to the world. Notice that I didn't make my argument about the <em>experience</em> of old-timers. Actually, I find that valuable as well, but that's the ordinary argument: <em>Listen to old people, because they have experience and wisdom.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of them do, at least.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't make much out of that argument, because you already know it. There'd be no reason to write this essay if that was all I had to say. Old people have less on the line, so they can speak more freely. If someone you used to admire retires and all of a sudden starts saying or writing unpleasant and surprising things, there might be a good explanation, and it might be a good idea to pay attention.
	</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an era of reliability where users depend on having consistent access to services. When choosing between competing services, <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/the-importance-of-reliability-engineering">no feature is more important to users than reliability</a>. But what does reliability mean?<br></p><p>To answer this question, we’ll break down reliability in terms of other metrics within reliability engineering: availability and maintainability. Distinguishing these terms isn’t a matter of semantics. Understanding the differences can help you better prioritize development efforts towards customer happiness.</p><h3>Availability</h3><p><strong>Availability</strong> is the simplest building block of reliability. This metric describes what percentage of the time a service is functioning. This is also referred to as the “uptime” of a service. Availability can be monitored by continuously querying the service and confirming responses return with expected speed and accuracy.<br></p><p>A service’s availability is a major component in how a user perceives the reliability. With this in mind, it can be tempting to set a goal for 100% uptime. But SRE teaches us that failure is inevitable; downtime-causing incidents will always occur outside of engineering expectations. Availability is often expressed in “nines,” representing how many decimal places the percentage of uptime can reach. Some major software companies will boast of “five nines,” or 99.999% uptime—but never 100%<br></p><p>Moreover, users will tolerate or even fail to notice downtime in some areas of your service. Development resources devoted to improving availability beyond expectations won’t increase customer happiness. Your service’s maintainability might need these resources instead.&nbsp;</p><h3>Maintainability</h3><p>Another major building block of reliability is <strong>maintainability</strong>. Maintainability factors into availability by describing how downtime originates and is resolved. When an incident causing downtime occurs, maintainable services can be repaired quickly. The sooner the incident is resolved, the sooner the service becomes available again.<br></p><p>There are two major components of maintainability: proactive and reactive.&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Proactive maintainability</strong> involves building a codebase that can be easily understood and changed. As development progresses, issues will arise from incompatibility with existing code. If engineers are writing “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a>” instead of prioritizing maintainability, issues are likely to occur and be difficult to find and solve. Proactive maintenance also includes procedures such as quality assurance and testing.<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reactive maintainability</strong> describes a service’s ability to be repaired after incidents. This is influenced by a service's incident response procedures. As incidents are inevitable, <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/great-incident-response-3-components">great incident response</a> and guardrails are a necessity. If incident response procedures are reliable, teams will resolve incidents quickly. Proper incident responses also foster learning to reduce recurrence. A highly maintainable service allows engineers to implement these lessons effectively<br></li></ul><p>Maintainability is reflected in availability metrics. Shortening downtime in length or frequency results in higher availability. But, maintainability isn't only a means to an end for availability. Taking that approach can result in poorly allocated development resources. Investing in maintainability may not immediately result in better uptime. When you refactor old code to resolve technical debt, the service will function the same as before, with the same availability. It isn’t until incidents occur that you’ll see the benefits of this higher maintainability. Maintainability should be thought of as an investment in reliability, rather than just a component of availability.</p><h3>Reliability</h3><p>Reliability can be defined as the likelihood of a service functioning as expected when accessed by a user. This may seem identical to how we defined availability, but there are key differences. Availability looks at whether the service is working, whether a user is accessing it or not. If users accessed the service uniformly across all features and at all times, availability would determine reliability. This is generally never the case. Consider two services:<br></p><p><strong>Service A:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>User log-on page has 97% availability</li><li>Catalog search has 97% availability</li><li>Site settings page has 97% availability<br></li></ul><p><strong>Service B:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>User log-on page has 99% availability</li><li>Catalog search has 98% availability</li><li>Site settings page has 90% availability<br></li></ul><p>Just looking at the metric of availability, Service A wins out. But if the log-on page is used by 100% of users, the catalog search by 90% of users, and the site settings page by only 30% of users, Service B will be perceived as more reliable. Reliability accounts for actual usage, converting availability metrics into a measure of customer happiness.<br></p><p>By understanding the reliability of a system, development can avoid wasting time improving availability beyond what the customer can appreciate. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">Service level indicators</a> bundle metrics such as latency and availability into a more impactful measurement. Then, <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">service level objectives</a> can be set at the threshold for customers becoming dissatisfied. This approach looks at reliability from the perspective of customers. How they perceive the reliability of the service is more important than its availability.<br></p><p>Maintainability can also be evaluated through this lens. The time spent responding to incidents drains a service's error budget for uptime.. SLIs and SLOs can help allocate development efforts to improving the maintainability and incident response procedures most impacting customer happiness.<br></p><p>Here is a table summarizing the distinctions between availability, maintainability, and reliability:</p><figure id="w-node-f882187c6816-359a5214"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec0224560bd6a6ef89a51ae/5f625dd5c056a2f2960b4f83_blog_table_avail-maintain-reliability_v1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><div><p>Reliability isn’t only a collection of metrics or a quality of your codebase. It’s a big-picture concept, incorporating the perspective of the users, the inevitability of change and growth, and the humans developing your code. This holistic approach is the foundation of SRE, a collection of practices and cultural lessons that improve your service's reliability.</p><p>Blameless helps take your reliability solution to the next level.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Microsoft Teams as a platform" itemref="hero-page-title"><div>
<p>2020 became the year of #WFH (work from home) and for many organizations also the turning point when Microsoft Teams became the primary place where being “at work” happens. This is accelerating the evolution of Teams from being merely a communication tool that connects human beings into a foundational service layer for many types of business applications.</p>



<p>How the concept of Teams as a platform contrasts with Microsoft’s Power Platform suite of technology is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. In this post I’ll first reflect on the relatively short history of where Teams came from. I’ll then examine how the recent feature announcements are brining apps front &amp; center in Teams. Finally, a few words on the possible future for Teams as part of Microsoft’s broader strategy.</p>



<h2>The road that lead to Teams</h2>



<p>Looking back ~10 years, the real-time communication &amp; instant messaging tools from MS seemed to be going through an endless renaming cycle: from OCS to Lync to Skype for Business. The core feature set presented to the end user didn’t seem to evolve nearly as much as product branding did. On a broader level, the communication activities of information workers within an organization still typically took place within Outlook’s inbox, and different servers like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM all packed their own features for posting short messages to other users.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>4 years ago, when the first images of what was then called “Skype Teams” started to leak out, we were already waiting for MS to create something a bit more ambitious than just another online meeting tool. Office Groups had began to emerge in various different places inside the MS Cloud, but they were primarily a technical construct with no sensible UX for everyday people to approach them. Even Dynamics CRM had it’s own solution that attempted to bring together the dicussion, calendars, notes, documents and team memberships from under an Office 365 Group associated with a record like account or opportunity:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/collaborate-with-colleagues-using-office-365-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/basics/media/office-groups-dashboard.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>I remember having many discussions with our CRM customers where I attempted to steer people away from deploying this Groups solution. Instead I wanted to encourage them to wait for something a bit more polished that I knew had to be on it’s way sooner or later.</p>



<p>At one point there was a clear &amp; present danger of another “Yammer moment” taking place, as Microsoft was reportedly quite serious about their plans to acquire Slack. In retrospect it was a blessing for both parties that MS decided to keep investing in building their own product, instead of trying to retrofit an established service like Slack into their existing software offering.</p>



<p>I would argue that this “build over buy” strategy which Microsoft has since then followed across their business software stack has been a key success factor for BizApps in particular.  It has enabled MS to move from merely chasing CRM competitors like Salesforce into redefining the business apps playing field with Power Platform. There’s a stark difference between acquiring companies and bundling them as “X Cloud” versus engineering your own software stack to act as a true platform.</p>



<h2>Teams: the collaboration chapter</h2>



<p>Initially the first version of the Microsoft Teams product that became generally available in Spring 2017 was pretty much focused on being three things: </p>



<ol><li>Replacement for Skype for Business</li><li>Alternative to Slack</li><li>UI layer for Office 365 Groups</li></ol>



<p>From a business applications perspective there wasn’t all that much you could do to hook Teams up with Dynamics 365, until Fall 2018 when the previews for the first integrated features were launched. In particular the integrated file sharing experience that Teams offered seemed almost like the Holy Grail for many CRM professionals, offering to fix the glaring hole in the SharePoint integration story that lacked any security model synchronization. The roadmap image below presents the plans from 2 years ago on how Teams and Dynamics 365 were going to be integrated:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The last item on the roadmap has still not been delivered, which is the visibility of Teams conversations inside the Dynamics 365 record form. Why this hasn’t been a higher priority for MS to implement seems to me like a sign of how Microsoft Teams is nowadays positioned as the primary UI for all information work. MS probably would prefer if everything always started from inside Teams. You pin record tabs into channels, you show previews of records inside teams discussions, you interact with records via bot interfaces and so on. As long as Teams is that big umbrella under which all work takes place.</p>



<p>The lack of a deep 2-way integration does not therefore mean that investments aren’t being made into the products involved. It can simply be a reflection of the new vision that is being built, by aligning many existing services to form a whole that aims to be greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>As an example, if you look at Microsoft’s task management story, you’ll see that features and data from across various apps like To Do, Planner and Outlook tasks / flagged emails are currently being collapsed into a central location that is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tasks app for Teams</a>. Tasks as a generic construct don’t necessarily need to be fully controlled by a single database, yet they very much need to be logically represented within “the hub for teamwork” that Teams is positioned as.</p>



<p>Going forward, when new apps appear into the MS cloud product portfolio and they need to offer task management features to users, the logical integration point to focus on would be Teams. For activity feed type of functionality the choice is even more clear for product development: choose to piggyback on Teams instead of inventing yet another stream of short messages.</p>



<h2>Teams: the platform chapter</h2>



<p>Moving beyond simply integrating Teams with products X, Y and Z, we’re now seeing the rise of a model where apps are built specifically to be used in Teams. This has of course been possible for a long time already, by developing custom web services and using the SDKs. Now there are many features coming up that will amplify the platform story around Teams on the no-code/low-code front specifically.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/215495iAC8095B3BF8D5E46/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999" alt="lists in teams1.png"></figure>



<p>Microsoft Lists app has been the  first to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-lists-in-microsoft-teams-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/1621979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reach GA</a> and offers an ultra low barrier for users to process data in a single table through a configurable, readymade UI. When accessed via Teams, the list data gains one more special dimension: discussions to be had regarding a list item. This is pretty much the same as the usage pattern offered for a Dynamics 365 record with the integration mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>Underneath the new covers of MS Lists is the technology familiar from SharePoint lists. If we were to only examine the UI layer, there is actually a remarkable similarity to a popular no-code service called Airtable. So much that the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mspoweruser.com/airtable-accuses-microsoft-of-copying-its-service/" target="_blank">accusations</a> of MS simply copying the visuals and core features from this competitor don’t seem entirely unjustified. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png" alt="" width="583" height="729" srcset="https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams.png 777w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-240x300.png 240w, https://jukkaniiranen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Airtable_for_teams-768x961.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure>



<p>Comparing these two offerings gives us some perspective on what exactly is the market position these tools are aiming to conquer. Simple lists themselves are not a particularly unique feature, rather it’s the team collaboration capabilities and ease of data sharing that turns these tables into what you’d call an actual app. Incidentally, just this week Airtable <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/airtable-platform-launch-automations-sync-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> they were building a full platform with apps offering JavaScript based extensibility, a marketplace for sharing apps, automations for executing business logic, and finally a sync service to transfer data across environments (“bases”).</p>



<p>Collaboration scenarios around semi-structured data like lists and Excel style tables can be seen as a  gateway drug. They allow turning email or paper based manual processes into a quick first draft of what the digital process could be like. If there are indeed clear business benefits in automating the said process, the requirements for more complex app features will soon begin to emerge from the user base. Hence the collaboration platform should offer an obvious path to grow these pre-built app experiences into more advanced no-code/low-code apps.</p>



<h2>Project Oakdale a.k.a bringing CDS to Teams</h2>



<p>If Microsoft Lists is the equivalent of an Excel table within the Teams context, then <a href="https://jukkaniiranen.com/2020/07/dataflex-is-more-and-less-than-cds/">Project Oakdale</a> / “CDS Lite” could be though of as bringing SQL Server inside Teams. Now, obviously Microsoft has zero intent on actually replacing Excel nor SQL with features built into Teams. They only need to introduce those parts that make sense from a team collabocation perspective.</p>



<p>Microsoft Lists is a far cry from what a real Excel workbook can do, yet it can offer much more value in a collaboration scenarios that those lone .xlsx files ever could. Similarly, the version of CDS that will very soon be available for building Power Apps within Teams is nowhere near as powerful as the services powering enterprise CRM systems like Dynamics 365 (or the raw power offered by SQL). Still, the fact that it can be found from within every team and used by a much larger audience than what Power Apps citizen developer tools could hope to capture – those are the factors that can truly make CDS a mainstream service that most information workers in the Microsoft 365 cloud interact it.</p>

<p>The experience of defining the CDS data model in Project Oakdale will be very different from the path that Power Apps makers have gone through – let alone the XRM veterans. In fact, you could easily mistake the table design and row entry UX to be that of Microsoft Lists rather than CDS. This highlights a key aspect that not all Power Platform experts may yet have grasped: for MS this “CDS Lite” is not so much about deciding what premium features of the full Power Platform to give away for free to Teams subscibers – rather it’s about how to best simplify the enterprise CRM features of CDS into a new product that Teams users could adopt on their own.</p>

		<p>Sometimes you encounter a striking figure of speech, comparison or just a metaphor that illustrates some concept in a much better way than anything you knew until now. It's so good you can't let it get unnoticed. In my case, it happened e.g. when I've learned to think about architects as "navigators". Or quite recently, while I was reading a very decent book by <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Michael Lopp</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083106-the-art-of-leadership">"The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well"</a>.</p><p>Speaking about the latter: my epiphany moment happened during chapter IV, entirely dedicated to the author's actionable advice for engineering leaders. The concluding one was about a reasonable alternative to micro-management: Lopp calls it ... <em>"tasting the soup"</em>. And I think it's brilliant and 100% spot-on.</p><p><strong>Tasting the soup</strong> - what does it mean?</p><p>Imagine a professional chef. A chief boss-cook. A reigning monarch of the kitchen (e.g. in a top-notch, highly reputed, Michelin-starred restaurant). (S)he is the person accountable for the quality of the holistic culinary experience here. It's his(/her) reputation at stake if customers are dissatisfied (for any reason). But still, it doesn't mean (s)he does all the job him(/her)self (to guarantee a suitable level of quality) - quite the opposite. There's the talented, hand-picked crew doing all the "dirty" work, while the chef-in-charge:</p><ul><li>tastes</li><li>probes</li><li>verifies</li></ul><p>It's not that (s)he cares only about the final outcome - the 100% ready dish. (S)he engages <u>at all the various stages</u> (of meal preparation): by inspecting raw materials, half-cooked ingredients, nearly ready products about to get the final touch. &nbsp;What's more - the soup is <u>"multi-dimensional"</u> - it has several equally important aspects (to assess separately): consistency, smell, color, temperature, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, etc.</p><p>Needless to say - the chef can't (&amp; shouldn't) be everywhere, all the time. (S)he <strong>can't assist every elementary activity</strong> - which is good and ... desirable. One <u>should not judge</u> the effect by the activities performed (which are - in many cases - meaningful "implementation" details or just elements of a highly-individualized style) but <strong>by the outcomes and how they match expectations </strong>(stated beforehand).</p><p>That's why (s)he restrains her(/him)self <u>to taste and probe</u> - it's sufficient because of <strong>past, practical experience</strong>. Precisely because of her/his experience, (s)he knows what to expect, whether the chosen direction is correct, whether there's a chance the final product will be edible &amp; satisfactory (aka will meet the given success criteria). (S)he's been there, (s)he's seen that. And as the one who knows what to expect, the chef is more probably able to detect all those very early warning lights and propose corrective actions.</p><p>Let me emphasize it again - micro-managing all the actions is not the way. Even with experience - <strong>it's NOT possible to know all the correct paths</strong>. Never ever. The number (of correct, good enough options) is endless.</p><p>I hope you've already figured it out by yourself - this chef soup tasting story can be easily mapped onto engineering management scenarios. Everything that has been said about the chef above can be directly translated into software development leaders' reality — starting with the role of experience and the importance of probing the effects (the current state of - process, tooling, various stages of deliverable completeness).</p><p>The default mode of an engineering manager's work should NOT be to dive deep into every possible (implementation) detail - it's just not feasible (but necessary in carefully chosen, critical situations that demand a more direct approach because of some warning lights flashing). A good engineering manager has to be able to:</p><ul><li>quickly orient her(/him)self in a situational context</li><li>identify the qualities that need to be assessed at this point</li><li>find a way to inspect them efficiently and objectively</li><li>confront the perceived learnings with expectations and past experience of similar endeavors</li></ul><p>In other words - to <em>"taste the engineering soup"</em>.</p><p>I think this metaphor is useful not just in calibrating your efforts (as an engineer manager), but also (as it's very "visual") can be very helpful in clarifying the meaning and importance of the engineering manager role: why is it needed, what value does it provide and what kind of input can one expect from a person bearing such a role.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <h3>Today's subject</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the first post</a> of the series we've looked at the CPython VM. We've learned that it works by executing a series of instructions called bytecode. We've also seen that Python bytecode is not sufficient to fully describe what a piece of code does. That's why there exists a notion of a code object. To execute a code block such as a module or a function means to execute a corresponding code object. A code object contains block's bytecode, constants and names of variables used in the block and block's various properties.</p>
<p>Typically, a Python programmer doesn't write bytecode and doesn't create the code objects but writes a normal Python code. So CPython must be able to create a code object from a source code. This job is done by the CPython compiler. In this part we'll explore how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>What CPython compiler is</h3>
<p>We understood what the responsibilities of the CPython compiler are, but before looking at how it is implemented, let's figure out why we call it a compiler in the first place?</p>
<p>A compiler, in its general sense, is a program that translates a program in one language into an equivalent program in another language. There are many types of compilers, but most of the times by a compiler we mean a static compiler, which translates a program in a high-level language to a machine code. Does the CPython compiler have something in common with this type of a compiler? To answer this question, let's take a look at the traditional three-stage design of a static compiler.</p>
<p><img src="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python_bts_02/diagram1.png" alt="diagram1"></p>
<p>The frontend of a compiler transforms a source code into some intermediate representation (IR). The optimizer then takes an IR, optimizes it and passes an optimized IR to the backend that generates machine code. If we choose an IR that is not specific to any source language and any target machine, then we get a key benefit of the three-stage design: for a compiler to support a new source language only an additional frontend is needed and to support a new target machine only an additional backend is needed.</p>
<p>The LLVM toolchain is a great example of a success of this model. There are frontends for C, Rust, Swift and many other programming languages that rely on LLVM to provide more complicated parts of the compiler. LLVM's creator, Chris Lattner, gives a good <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/llvm.html">overview of its architecture</a>.</p>
<p>CPython, however, doesn't need to support multiple source languages and target machines but only a Python code and the CPython VM. Nevertheless, CPython compiler is an implementation of the three-stage design. To see why, we should examine the stages of a three-stage compiler in more detail. </p>
<p><img src="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python_bts_02/diagram2.png" alt="diagram1"></p>
<p>The picture above represents a model of a classic compiler. Now compare it to the architecture of the CPython compiler in the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python_bts_02/diagram3.png" alt="diagram1"></p>
<p>Looks similar, isn't it? The point here is that the structure of the CPython compiler should be familiar to anyone who studied compilers before. If you didn't, a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">Dragon Book</a> is an excellent introduction to the theory of compiler construction. It's long, but you'll benefit even by reading only the first few chapters.</p>
<p>The comparison we've made requires several comments. First, since version 3.9, CPython uses a new parser by default that outputs an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) straight away without an intermediate step of building a parse tree. Thus, the model of the CPython compiler is simplified even further. Second, some of the presented phases of the CPython compiler do so little compared to their counterparts of the static compilers that some may say that the CPython compiler is no more than a frontend. We won't take this view of the hardcore compiler writers.</p>
<h3>Overview of the compiler's architecture</h3>
<p>The diagrams are nice, but they hide many details and can be misleading, so let's spend some time discussing the overall design of the CPython compiler.</p>
<p>The two major components of the CPython compiler are:</p>
<ol>
<li>the frontend; and</li>
<li>the backend.</li>
</ol>
<p>The frontend takes a Python code and produces an AST. The backend takes an AST and produces a code object. Throughout the CPython source code the terms parser and compiler are used for the frontend and the backend respectively. This is yet another meaning of the word compiler. It was probably better to call it something like a code object generator, but we'll stick with the compiler since it doesn't seem to cause much trouble.</p>
<p>The job of the parser is to check whether the input is a syntactically correct Python code. If it's not, then the parser reports an error like the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span>
        <span>^</span>
<span>SyntaxError</span><span>:</span> <span>invalid</span> <span>syntax</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If the input is correct, then the parser organizes it according to the rules of the grammar. A grammar defines the syntax of a language. The notion of a formal grammar is so crucial for our discussion that, I think, we should digress a little to remember its formal definition.</p>
<p>According to the classic definition, a grammar is a tuple of four items:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>\(\Sigma\)</span> – a finite set of terminal symbols, or simply terminals (usually denoted by lowercase letters).</li>
<li><span>\(N\)</span> – a finite set of nonterminal symbols, or simply nonterminals (usually denoted by uppercase letters).</li>
<li><span>\(P\)</span> – a set of production rules. In the case of context-free grammars, which include the Python grammar, a production rule is just a mapping from a nonterminal to any sequence of terminals and nonterminals like <span>\(A \to aB\)</span>.</li>
<li><span>\(S\)</span> – one distinguished nonterminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>A grammar defines a language that consists of all sequences of terminals that can be generated by applying production rules. To generate some sequence, one starts with the symbol <span>\(S\)</span> and then recursively replaces each nonterminal with a sequence according to production rules until the whole sequence consists of terminals. Using established convention for the notation, it's sufficient to list production rules to specify the grammar. Here is, for example, a simple grammar that generates sequences of alternating ones and zeros:</p>
<p><span>\(S \to 10S \;| \;10\)</span></p>
<p>We'll continue to discuss grammars when we look at the parser in more detail.</p>
<h3>Abstract syntax tree</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of the parser is to produce an AST. An AST is a tree data structure that serves as a high-level representation of a source code. Here's an example of a piece of code and a dump of the corresponding AST produced by the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html"><code>ast</code></a> module:</p>



<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m ast example1.py
Module(
   body=[
      Assign(
         targets=[
            Name(id='x', ctx=Store())],
         value=Constant(value=123)),
      Expr(
         value=Call(
            func=Name(id='f', ctx=Load()),
            args=[
               Name(id='x', ctx=Load())],
            keywords=[]))],
   type_ignores=[])
</pre></div>


<p>The types of the AST nodes are formally defined using <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/TR-554-97">the Zephyr Abstract Syntax Definition Language</a> (ASDL). The ASDL is a simple declarative language that was created to describe tree-like IRs, which is what the AST is. Here is the definitions of the <code>Assign</code> and <code>Expr</code> nodes from <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Parser/Python.asdl">Parser/Python.asdl</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>stmt = ... | Assign(expr* targets, expr value, string? type_comment) | ...
expr = ... | Call(expr func, expr* args, keyword* keywords) | ...
</pre></div>


<p>The ASDL specification should give us an idea of what the Python AST looks like. The parser, however, needs to represent an AST in the C code. Fortunately, it's easy to generate the C structs for the AST nodes from their ASDL descriptions. That's what CPython does, and the result looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_stmt</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>_stmt_kind</span> <span>kind</span><span>;</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ... other kinds of statements</span>
        <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>asdl_seq</span> <span>*</span><span>targets</span><span>;</span>
            <span>expr_ty</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
            <span>string</span> <span>type_comment</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>Assign</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// ... other kinds of statements</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>lineno</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>col_offset</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>end_lineno</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>end_col_offset</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_expr</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>_expr_kind</span> <span>kind</span><span>;</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ... other kinds of expressions</span>
        <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>expr_ty</span> <span>func</span><span>;</span>
            <span>asdl_seq</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>;</span>
            <span>asdl_seq</span> <span>*</span><span>keywords</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>Call</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// ... other kinds of expressions</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... same as in _stmt</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>An AST is a handy representation to work with. It tells what a program does, hiding all non-essential information such as indentation, punctuation and other Python's syntactic features.</p>
<p>One of the main beneficiaries of the AST representation is the compiler, which can walk an AST and emit bytecode in a relatively straightforward manner. Many Python tools, besides the compiler, use the AST to work with Python code. For example, <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/">pytest</a> makes changes to an AST to provide useful information when the <code>assert</code> statement fails, which by itself does nothing but raises an <code>AssertionError</code> if the expression evaluates to <code>False</code>. Another example is <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit">Bandit</a> that finds common security issues in Python code by analyzing an AST.</p>
<p>Now, when we've studied the Python AST a little bit, we can look at how the parser builds it from a source code.</p>
<h3>From source code to AST</h3>
<p>In fact, as I mentioned earlier, starting with version 3.9, CPython has not one but two parsers. The new parser is used by default. It's also possible to use the old parser by passing <code>-X oldparser</code> option. In CPython 3.10, however, the old parser will be completely removed.</p>
<p>The two parser are very different. We'll focus on the new one but before discuss the old parser as well.</p>
<h4>old parser</h4>
<p>For a long time the Python's syntax was formally defined by the generative grammar. It's a kind of grammar we've talked about earlier. It tells us how to generate sequences belonging to the language. The problem is that a generative grammar doesn't directly corresponds to the parsing algorithm that would be able to parse those sequences. Fortunately, smart people have been able to distinguish classes of generative grammars for which the corresponding parser can be built. These include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">context free</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_grammar">LL(k),</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser">LR(k)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser">LALR</a> and many …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="take-measurements-every-30-minutes">Take measurements every 30 minutes</h2>
<p>Then I added this to <code>crontab</code> so it runs every 30 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="pulling-records-from-firestore-to-google-sheets">Pulling records from Firestore to Google Sheets</h2>
<p>I let this run for a bit over 24 hours, and got 52 readings. Next step was to write a small Google Apps Script to pull these records from Firestore and put them in rows in a Google Sheets worksheet.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>copyFromFirestore</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then it’s simple to chart the speeds and latency over the roughly 24-hour period.</p>

<p><img src="https://perryizgr8.github.io/images/speedtest.png" alt="Speed test chart"></p>

<h2 id="problem-in-the-setup">Problem in the setup</h2>
<p>This chart shows that my download speed varies between 20 to 35Mbps, and the upload varies between 15 to 20Mbps. This is significantly lower than the 100Mbps symmetric I pay for. If you go back to the first test result I showed in this post, which I ran from my laptop, it shows 83Mbps download and 60Mbps upload. So why this discrepancy?</p>

<p>I suspect this is where my old Pi is showing its age. Even though it is connected to my router using a 100Mbps ethernet cable, the hardware is simply not powerful enough to fully saturate the connection. So I will not be running this setup anymore. Maybe one day I’ll get a newer model and run this for a longer duration. That would hopefully reveal some interesting patterns.</p>

<p>Another concern of mine is the amount of data transfered. Each run of the test consumes around 60MB of data. Running it every half hour for a month would use up ~85GB. That is close to 17% of my plan’s monthly quota. That would probably push me over the limit and cause the connection to slow down to something unusable like 1Mbps.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Going to a university is important because you not only learn about the subject of your choice to build a foundation for your career, but also it is the place where your ideas and opinions about the world are formed and your personality is developed. For many it is the beginning of their independent life and teaches them how to overcome hurdles on their own.</p>

<p>I loved my time in my undergraduate. Not because my college was great or anything, it was hardly average, but because I made many great friends for life, tasted independence and the cost associated with it, and tried to explore many new things and failed miserably or gave up halfway in most of them. But when I look back, there are some things which I feel I could have done way better and some amazing opportunities which I completely let pass by me. I am writing this to myself to introspect where I could have improved back then so that I can improve right now and if someone else finds this useful, I will be a happy person.</p>

<p>Don’t take this as a structure or guiding principle of your university life. It is your youth life and you have to shape it yourself, not let others shape it for you because if you let others shape your life for you then you are not learning anything. On top of that, you are losing your freedom and a major part of yourself. I am a believer in Herman Hesse’s philosophy (in his book Siddhartha). Learn from everything that comes to you, analyse it, absorb the good things, let go of the negative things, and then go on your journey to find what you are and explore your life, because it is yours. Remember, the meaning of life is not to copy a billionaire or a sports person and become successful like them. The meaning of life is - why. Why is this your life? Why do you want to live your life? Be yourself, not imitate others.</p>

<p>In Zen Buddhism there is a saying (or <em>koan</em> as they call it) which I truly love. “When you meet the Buddha, kill him.” What it means is be open and courageous even towards things you don’t know. Don’t follow Buddha as is, rather learn from him and go on your own path. Resume your own Buddha. There is no path in life. If there is a path in your life, you are living someone else’s life.</p>

<p>Here are some of things which improved me and I recommend them to everyone.</p>



<p>The habit that brought about the biggest positive change in me is reading which I inculcated in myself during my sophomore year. I used to read books prior to that as well but reading wasn’t such a habit per se. I barely read 3-4 books a year. If at that point you had asked me which was the last book I had read, I would have said 1984 by George Orwell, which I had read almost an year before.</p>

<p>I started with a goal in mind - 50 books in 2017 - and I was lucky enough that the first book I picked, Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson, really inspired me to do what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Why I recommend reading as habit to everyone is because of three reasons (or positive changes which I have felt in myself) -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reading teaches patience -</strong> At first, it is very difficult to sit down with a book for 30 minutes and focus on nothing but the text. You won’t be able to concentrate properly because there are too many distractions around and the biggest is the mobile phone and social media. In terms of negative effects on patience, mobile phones and social media train your mind towards short and quick sources of information, like Facebook notifications, news pop-ups, etc, and because of that many find it really hard to sit calmly through a book. Ask yourself, can you or your friends sit alone for an hour without getting impatient about not checking their phones? If the answer is no, you know you lack self-control and patience. If the answer is yes, you are doing quite well and you have an amazing company of people!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You learn a lot -</strong> Reading any book, irrespective of the genre, teaches you how to frame your thoughts and convey them, increases your vocabulary, improves your grammar and teaches you how to write. Reading non-fiction especially teaches you about things like history, science, and great people, for example. No matter which genre you are reading, you end up learning a lot of things. The only genre of books that I don’t recommend is cheap modern fiction because they do not make any sense to me - there is no literature in them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You learn about yourself -</strong> Reading is like meditation. It is a conversation between yourself and the writer. Fully absorbing the meaning of the words requires a certain amount of focus. In understanding what the writer is trying to convey, you will sometimes realise that you know so little about this topic or your opinions about a particular topic is narrow, biased etc. This introspection opens up a tunnel to your consciousness and helps to clear your thinking. I believe this introspection is essential for assessing yourself.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Reality is neutral. The world is how we perceive it to be. It is only after changing your attitude that you will learn to be welcoming towards new challenges and be positive. Three main changes in my attitude which really made me better -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be curious about everything and learn new things, not just the things that are related to your field of study, but also other disparate fields. For example, if you are studying computer science, learn psychology and try to see computer science through glasses of psychology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be welcoming towards change. Life is like a sine graph, it is never constant. Changes will come and it is our attitude that defines how we deal with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be responsible for your actions and life. Don’t blame your failures on circumstances or family, especially on your parents. They have tried hard and sacrificed a lot to make sure you become a better person - better than they are.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>We are social animals and as social animals one of the most important qualities that any of us can possess is to think logically and in a heuristic way by taking first principles into considerations and write down clearly what you think and be able to speak them out cogently. These skills are essential in modern day and age because society is so intertwined that you will have to constantly communicate with others and persuade them if you want to progress towards your goal. Interviews, persuasion, salary hikes, relationships, etc are just some examples where a good communication skill can pay off huge dividends.</p>

<p>This is one field where I still lack. What works best, according to me, is to write daily for at least 30 mins and try to speak to yourself what you just read in a book or article. It improves the clarity of the chain of your thoughts and also helps to shuffle and select striking points.</p>



<p>You cannot get complete freedom until you take control of certain aspects of your life and don’t worry about things that are not in your control.</p>

<p>What I found most helpful was to create a schedule and follow it. At first it takes a lot of effort to adjust yourself accordingly but after sometime you find it quite revitalizing. At first you might be able to stick to only 50% of your schedule and that’s fine. Try to make it 55% the next day. Remember the process to follow a schedule is incremental not instantaneous. Some unprecedented things will always come to break you out of the schedule and that is completely okay. Life is, after all, like a wave with ups and downs, not a still ocean. From my experience, the optimal stick-to-itiveness to a schedule is around 90% and I don’t think anyone can stick to their schedule 100% of the time because life is serendipitous.</p>



<p>Occasional procrastination is normal but if you are procrastinating everytime, skipping your work to nap for thirty minutes, or your tasks in your to-do-list are increasing constantly, then you are procrastinating and need to get back on the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>Some things I found quite useful to tackle procrastination -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There is no fun in procrastination -</strong>  For example, if you complete your work on time, you get more time to focus on your hobbies or watch a movie. Even resting with an empty mind is way better than pretending to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Making a schedule -</strong> Schedule really helps in arranging your day to utilise it to the fullest. That is why many CEOs have such a tight schedule to get maximum out of their day. Also, schedule provides a sort of supervision that helps to make sure you are on the correct path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cut social media -</strong> One of the best things I have done in my life is delete Facebook. But eventually I got addicted to Twitter and Instagram and it was consuming a lot of my time, focus and emotions and increased my procrastination. The thing that works for me is to open Twitter and Instagram only in a half an hour window during the evening coffee break.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Explore things that are around you, collect experiences, travel, be in nature. I have been to many trips but there were a couple of them I missed and I still regret them. Nevertheless, it’s never too late to plan another trip.</p>



<p>If you think about the future, you will be constantly worried. If you think about the past, you will be constantly regretful. What has happened and will happen is not in your control. What is in your control is what can happen.</p>

<p>I have lived a substantial chunk of my undergraduate life thinking about how things could have been or how things should have been but I was rarely mindful of how things actually are. Having this kind of mental state is akin to living in a pseudo-simulation, where you are living in a self-created illusion which seems real to you but, on the contrary, reality becomes an illusion.</p>

<p>Learn from the past, be mindful and conscious of the things in hand, and shape your future.</p>

<p>Be lively, fun loving. Search for love, spread love.</p>

<title>The Input Output Distinction in Learning</title>
<h2>Value and Cost in Learning</h2>
<p>Learners are goal-driven decision-makers. They invest their limited time, energy and other resources in learning in order to gain in some way from that investment. Therefore a rational learning system must record, analyze and balance value and cost to maximally fulfil the user's goals in learning.</p>
<p>Learning systems that do not consider value and cost will direct learners to make suboptimal  investments in learning.</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<h4>The Subjectivity of Value</h4>
<p>Value is <strong>subjective</strong>. That means two different learners may have completely different "value functions".</p>
<p>My personal theory of the value of learning can be summarized as:</p>
<p><em>Learning is worthwhile insofar as it contributes to creative output which is shared into the real world.</em></p>
<p>The purpose behind the separation of learning processes into Input and Output (the subject of this article) is to make "creating value" (as I define it) easier.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/time-allocation.png" alt="time-allocation"></p>
<p><em>Learners are resource constrained and must carefully allocate their limited resources to maximally satisfy their subjective theory of value.</em></p>
<p>Learning processes all have associated costs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time (the ultimate resource)</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Money</li>
<li>...</li>

</ul>
<p>The purpose behind the separation of learning processes into Input and Output (the subject of this article) is to minimize the cost of sharing creative output.</p>
<h4>The Rational Analysis of Learning</h4>
<p>Specific value functions may differ between individuals - not everyone will agree that creative output is the ultimate purpose of learning, however, the maximization of value (however it is defined) per unit of cost is a goal shared between all rational learners.</p>
<p>The goal of the Rational Analysis of Learning is to record, balance and optimize a learning system in accordance with the learner's value function.</p>
<h2>Input Output vs Passive Active</h2>
<p>One distinction people often make when discussing learning processes is the difference between Passive and Active learning. It is useful to review, compare and contrast the Passive-Active model with my Input-Output model.</p>
<p>Passive learning is characterized by passive consumption of information.</p>
<p>Examples of passive learning techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading books</li>
<li>Listening to podcasts</li>
<li>Watching lectures</li>

</ul>
<p>Active learning strategies involve retrieval of information in response to some stimulus.</p>
<p>Examples of Active learning techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Exercises </li>
<li>SRS repetitions (active recall)</li>
<li>Programming Projects</li>

</ul>
<p>There is also a middle ground containing learning processes that require both passive and active components. </p>
<p>The Passive-Active distinction can be represented as an overlapping Venn diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/Passive-Active-learning.png" alt="Passive-Active-learning"></p>
<p>While the passive-active model is useful, I prefer to categorize learning processes into "Input" and "Output" in order to integrate the passive-active distinction with my theory regarding the value of learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/Input-output-venn.png" alt="Input-output-venn"></p>
<h3>Input Output: A Worthwhile Abstraction</h3>
<p>The idea behind splitting learning processes into Input and Output is to distinguish more critically between those active learning processes that result in "real world" creative output (my subjective understanding of the value of learning) vs those that do not. </p>
<p>This model is useful to me because:</p>
<ol start="">
<li>All learning processes have an Input component, an Output component or both. Input and Output are broadly applicable concepts, similar to the concepts of "stimulus" and "response" in Psychology.</li>
<li><em>Most</em> of my learning can be divided cleanly into Input or Output.</li>
<li>The Input Output model integrates with my understanding of cost and value.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In addition to the "obvious" input activities like reading, watching and listening, my definition of Input <strong>includes</strong> certain Active learning processes, such as textbook exercises and SRS repetitions.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/Input-with-extract-without-output.png" alt="Input-output-venn"></p>
<p><em>An Input process adds a new stream of information into the brain. Through generalization, the information stream is filtered and condensed, concepts and abstract rules are extracted and new knowledge is integrated into the brain's latticework of prior knowledge.</em></p>
<p>According to my subjective "value function", no value is created until my knowledge is employed in some process that results in creative output into the real world. Since no Input processes satisfy that requirement, none of them create value by themselves.</p>
<h4>The Potential to Create Output</h4>
<p>Input processes may <strong>directly or indirectly</strong> increase my ability to produce Output. </p>
<ul>
<li>Investing time and energy into Input activities gives me the <strong>potential</strong> to "create value".</li>
<li>Some Input processes increase your <strong>ability</strong> to "create value" more than others.</li>
<li>Certain Input processes give you the <strong>option</strong> to create large amounts of value, but at a steep "cost".</li>

</ul>
<p>A rational learning system...</p>
<ol start="">
<li>Adjusts the ratio of time and other resources spent between Input and Output processes to maximize "value creation".</li>
<li>Prioritizes between different Input and Output processes to create the the most value for the least cost.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>My understanding of Output excludes those Active learning processes that do not result in "creative output that is shared into the real world".</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/Input-with-extract-with-output.png" alt="Input-output-venn"></p>
<p><em>The information stream, having been filtered, condensed, extracted and assimilated, provides a meaningful association that results in a creative solution to some problem which you consequently share with the world.</em></p>
<p>Output processes are what I define as the "value creation" part of learning.</p>
<p>They represent "creative output into the real world".</p>
<p>Examples of processes I believe satisfy that definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing plugins for SuperMemoAssistant that are shared with other SuperMemo users.</li>
<li>Podcasting.</li>
<li>Writing and sharing this blog post.</li>

</ul>
<p>Examples of processes I believe do NOT satisfy that definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook exercises.</li>
<li>Programming tutorials.</li>
<li>Exams.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Input Output: A Design Pattern</h3>
<p>The Input Output distinction can be expressed as a practical system of organization for learning. The following is an implementation of the Input Output Design Pattern in <span name="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/kt-input-output.png">  </p>
<p>All of the elements in my knowledge tree are divided into two folders underneath the root node - Input and Output. </p>
<p>This separation is convenient for the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>It allows for separation between elements that are used for Input processes (eg. Wikipedia articles) and elements that are used for Output processes (eg. Incremental Writing topics), which is convenient from an organization standpoint.</li>
<li>It does not require you to silo Input material and creative Output material into separate collections. This improves the creative process by increasing the probability of making serendipitous associations between concepts.</li>
<li>The pattern emphasizes neural linking to share Input material and concepts between multiple projects, increasing modularity and reducing cost.</li>
<li>It supports a rational analysis of learning by allowing you to measure the ratio of time spent between Input and Output processes, based on time spent in the Input branch vs time spent in the Output branch. (I will discuss this more in a future article).</li>

</ul>
<h4>Output Branch</h4>
<p>The output branch consists of folders or concepts, each representing a piece of creative output in progress.</p>
<p>In the picture you can see how I organized the branch representing this article within the Output branch:</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/kt-project-node.png">  </p>
<p>I choose to use concepts as the root element for projects I'm actively working on rather than dismissed topics because of the ability to use neural links.</p>
<p>Using neural links allows me to 1) avoid moving material back and forth between the Input folder and the Output folder, 2) enables me to share useful material between multiple active projects and 3) allows me to use neural review to explore related ideas and projects.</p>
<h5>Output Tasks</h5>
<p>Rather than using a separate task list for each project, I'm currently using one 'global' task list for the Output branch. I move individual tasks into "Tasks" folders based on the project.</p>
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of a global Output task list:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Easier to compare the priority of tasks across multiple projects - can open all Output tasks in a Task list browser and sort by priority.</td><td>More difficult to compare the priority of tasks within a single project - have to use the subset browser.</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h4>Input Branch</h4>
<p>The input branch is quite chaotic. I haven't spent much time organizing it. It might not be worth the time it would require to organize it properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/kt-input-branch.png">  </p>
<h5>Input Tasks</h5>
<p>I keep a 'global' input task list for recommended content. Recommended content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Lecture series</li>
<li>Documentaries</li>
<li>A list of potential concepts / keywords to learn.</li>
<li>Lists of interesting / inspiring people to learn about</li>
<li>Biographies</li>

</ul>
<h4>Some Observations</h4>
<ol start="">
<li><p>One interesting neural link I made was between the concept representing this article and a concept called Knowledge Tree Design Patterns. I realized that the article's content, plus any feedback from readers could be reused as input into a broader, more general article on Knowledge Tree Design Patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://experimental-learning.com/static/images/input-output/neural-link.png">  </p>
<p>In this way, the entire learning process can be thought of a cycle where Input processes support creative output through Output processes, which in turn can be recycled into Input...</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initially I found it unintuitive to use neural links, as opposed to moving Input material directly into the Output folder since I was more familiar with the move function than neural linking. Later I decided that there are potentially many projects that could use the same Input material, so neural links would make it simpler to share material in the Input folder with multiple active projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rather than classifying creative output into folders like "Incremental writing" or "podcast", I found it more valuable to make the creative output concepts medium-agnostic. This encourages me to share the creative output and get feedback from multiple platforms.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<h5>Neural Links</h5>
<p>The emphasis on neural links in this pattern is useful because it will build up the number of high value links in your collection, making …</p></div></div>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career (Semiconductor industry), I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks. This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. to put a smile on the face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own!</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">source</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is always difficult to choose a tech stack for your application. Especially one that is going to be worked on by many people in the future. The fact that technologies like Javascript change almost on a daily basis and new frameworks come up every time I browse the internet does not make this job any easier.<br></p><p>On one hand you want to be using the latest technologies available but on the other hand you can’t afford to have a high learning curve or use something that is not a 100% stable yet because you are most likely going to build a long term business that must stand the test of time.<br></p><p>In many ways it is similar to choosing a person to date. You wanna go with the best looking one but you also need the person to have some depth so that you can have a long term relationship!<br></p><p>So how do you choose the right tech stack? I can’t say for sure that the methods that am employing are the best ones and readers can always reach out to me on twitter and correct me but here are some of the things that I am keeping in mind right now<br></p><h3><strong>Prioritising speed over “doing the right thing”</strong><br></h3><p>It is important for a startup to move fast. If I spend time learning new technologies and understanding all the nuances of those technologies it might take a long time to actually build a product and get it out the door. <br></p><p>For instance, I am currently building a <a href="https://www.delight.chat/" target="_blank">customer support software for e-commerce businesses</a> and I have been advised by a few folks that my use case would involve dealing with a lot of unstructured data so MongoDB is the right database to use. <br></p><p>The issue here is that I do not have much experience with nosql and I have personally never used it in production. So even if this is the right thing, it might end up causing me a lot of grief down the line when I am not able to debug certain issues just because I don’t have a deeper understanding of the subject. <br></p><p>I decided to go with Postgres instead because while being a relational database which I am comfortable with, Postgres supports a datatype called JSONB where you can store unstructured data much like in Mongo. This seemed like the optimal thing to do.<br></p><h3><strong>Other people will be working on your codebase</strong><br></h3><p>I my previous venture, I wrote some services in Golang. I did this because I enjoy writing code in Go, not to mention that it is a compiled language with syntax that is easy to understand and yields performance that is close to C/C++.<br></p><p>This seemed like a good idea at the time because the services I wrote in Go were highly scalable and I did not have to touch them again for a long time. The issue came up when we exited the business and I had to transfer the codebase to folks who never worked in Golang. <br></p><p>The same thing could happen when you hire new folks who might have great aptitude for the role but do not necessarily know all the nuances of working with a brand new language. This is going to delay development time significantly.<br></p><h3><strong>Do not spend time on solved problems </strong><br></h3><p>The amount of work required to build your core product is already quite high, you don’t want to be making it worse by spending valuable development hours on building things that are not core to your product.<br></p><p>For our current product we needed a socket infrastructure so that the server can push real time updates to the browser when a certain event takes place. At first I thought of using something like <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> but after giving it some further thought, I realised that it would take up considerable bandwidth to maintain the socket service as the product scales in usage.<br></p><p>We decided to cough up some $$ and go with <a href="http://pusher.com/" target="_blank">pusher.com</a> instead. They are a SaaS that offer socket infrastructure as a service. If their entire business depends on one particular pain point, it is safe to assume that they would have done the best possible job of handling it and would have found out all the edge cases and bugs that might come up. <br></p><h3><strong>Break up the product into microservices</strong><br></h3><p>For a monolithic codebase there is pretty much no choice but to work on the same language and frameworks for the foreseeable future. This means that not only are you stuck with a tech stack that you choose a long time ago, but even the folks you hire in the future will be stuck working on the same thing as well.<br></p><p>To prevent this, it is important to segregate your product into micro services that can be developed, maintained and deployed independently so that you can easily swap some of these services with new ones written in a new language or framework without affecting the working of the rest of the product.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>While speed is important, it is also important to make sure that your employees are comfortable with the tech stack and do not feel like their careers are being jeopardised due to not being able to work on the latest technologies and frameworks that are available in the market. It would not be fair for me to say that we will only use PHP and nothing else and whoever joins us must suck it up and work on it. <br></p><p>It could also negatively impact us if we miss out on the ease of problem solving that new technologies and frameworks provide. So there must always be balance &nbsp;between speed and upgrading yourself to something new and better. <br></p><p>So if you find yourself in a position where there is a new technology that can make things significantly better but it would require a learning curve and a considerable risk of not being able to find employees who can work on this technology very easily, it might still be worth to go for it.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>Nowadays, industries are greatly changing their properties due to rapid development of IoT (Internet of Things), Big Data and AI (Artificial Intelligence). That is also called “4th Industrial Revolution”. In these circumstances, semiconductors are increasingly used in a large number of devices for information and communication, memory, optical and wireless components, sensors, actuators, etc., and their application field is becoming far wider such as health and medical, automobiles and transportation, environments and energy, education, etc.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Large semiconductor production facilities (Mega Fab) usually require billions of dollars in investment and, therefore, the manufacturing is limited to a few large companies in the world. On the other hand, Minimal Fab is a different method of semiconductor production and it requires extremely smaller investment than for Mega Fab. Moreover, Minimal Fab can provide flexible methods of manufacturing and is especially suitable for high-mix low-volume semiconductor production. This is also suitable for new IoT applications in the 4th Industrial Revolution world.</p>
	<p>The idea of Minimal Fab was first produced in AIST (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) and it was then developed to practical use by a consortium of AIST and 22 companies in Japan. The consortium has been recently evolved to Minimal Fab Promoting Organization.</p>
	<p>We are aiming to establish a completely new and flexible production system and to bring about a process revolution by Minimal Fab. Moreover, we would like to widely expand the field of application of semiconductors by Minimal Fab. Our organization composed of more than 150 companies is going to promote and disseminating the Minimal Fab technology and its application. We are sincerely asking you a cooperation and support to the Minimal Fab.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on February  2, 2020
    
</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<h4 id="why-stack-script">Why stack script ?</h4>
<p>If you share small, single module, self contained haskell examples, stack script gives us an easy way to get reproducible builds, by pinning the dependencies to a Stackage snapshot within a comment at the top of your Haskell code.<br>
There are at least two additional motivations, besides reproducible builds, that you might want to use Stack’s scripting feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower the configuration barrier: write an independently compiling Haskell source code file with package dependencies without having to configure a new stack or cabal project. Personally, I find this helpful when exploring new libraries or writing small programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Haskell as a scripting language, or replacement for Shell/Bash/Zsh. This use case pairs well with the <code>Turtle</code> library, although this approach does have downsides.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="about">About</h4>
<p>Stack is a build tool primarily designed for reproducible builds, done by specifying a resolver in a configuration file, usually your projects <code>stack.yaml</code> and <code>package.yaml</code> With Stack’s scripting feature, we still get reproducible builds by specifying a resolver, but move this specification to the file we are compiling, or as a command line argument. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume that these scripts are run outside of a stack project, and stack is invoked in the same directory as the script file.<br>
<em>Note:</em> When running a stack script inside of a stack project, it’s important to consider that stack will read settings from your <code>project.yaml</code> and <code>stack.yaml</code>, which may cause issues.</p>
<h2 id="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
<h4 id="outline">Outline</h4>
<p>This article contains the following examples of using scripting with stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic example of the Scripting Interpreter</li>
<li>A simple Servant server that statically serves your current working directory</li>
<li>An example of stack as a bash replacement</li>
<li>Using stack script to launch ghci</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="basic-example-of-stack-script">Basic example of stack script</h4>
<p>For our first example, we’ll use stack to run a single file of Haskell source code as a script.</p>
<p>Here’s the source code we want to run, in a filed called <code>simple.hs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "compiled &amp; run"</code></pre>
<p>To run this with the stack script interpreter, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack script simple.hs --resolver lts-14.18</code></pre>
<p>The resolver argument is mandatory, and Stack will compile and run the <code>simple.hs</code> file immediately after invocation using the <code>lts-14.18</code> Stackage snapshot.<br>
Alternatively, we can put all of the configuration information into the script itself, like this:</p>
<pre><code>{- stack script 
 --resolver lts-14.18
-}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "compiled &amp; run"</code></pre>
<p>which can be compiled and run with <code>$ stack simple.hs</code>.</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-servant-server">A simple Servant server</h4>
<p>The “killer feature” for scripting with stack is probably the ability to pull in packages without having to a <code>stack.yaml</code> or<br>
This can probably be best seen with <code>stack ghci</code>, where the following command will drop you into a ghci repl where you have <code>lens</code> and <code>text</code> packages available from the specificied resolver.</p>
<pre><code>stack ghci --package text --package lens --resolver lts-14.18</code></pre>
<p>An example of this concept with the stack scripting engine, is a quick and dirty file server, <code>explore.hs</code> would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>~/projects/stack-script$ cat explore.hs
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack script
 --resolver nightly-2019-12-22
 --install-ghc
 --package "servant-server warp"
 --ghc-options -Wall
-}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeOperators, TypeApplications #-}

module FileServer where

import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp( defaultSettings, runSettings, setBeforeMainLoop, setPort)
import Servant (Proxy(Proxy), Raw, serve, serveDirectoryWebApp)

main :: IO ()
main = runSettings settings . serve (Proxy @Raw) $ serveDirectoryWebApp "."
  where port = 8080
        msg = "serving on http://localhost:" ++ show port ++ "/{pathToFile}"
        settings = setPort port $ setBeforeMainLoop (putStrLn msg) defaultSettings</code></pre>
<p>Noting a couple of features</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--install-ghc</code> is the flag to install ghc, if it is not already available.</li>
<li>The addition of the hash bang, (line 1), <code>#!/usr/bin/env stack</code>, let’s you run this as an executable, <code>$ ./explore.hs</code></li>
<li>If running, this script will let you see it’s source code at <code>localhost:8080/static/explore.hs</code>, along with any other files within the current working directory the script was run.</li>
<li>The snapshot here is a nightly from the day the script was written, <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2019-12-22">nightly-2019-12-22</a>, which ensures the most up to date version of libraries are used when the script is written while still pinning us to a specific snapshot.</li>
<li>We pass in <code>-Wall</code> to ghc-options, and can give additional ghc options here.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a fresh compilation, this will take a few minutes to run, as Stack needs to go and grab about 255Mb worth of source code in ~86 dependent packages, compile and link it in order for the above code to run. However, on subsequent runs, Stack can use a local cache of of the packages, and we can reproduce our project build without downloading and building all the dependencies!</p>
<h4 id="stack-script-as-a-bash-replacement">Stack Script as a Bash Replacement</h4>
<p>It’s possible to use haskell, and Stack scripting feature, along with the Turtle library as a drop in replacement for shell scripting!<br>
To do this, we need the following at the top of our Haskell file:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack script
 --compile
 --copy-bins
 --resolver lts-14.17
 --install-ghc
 --package "turtle text foldl async"
 --ghc-options=-Wall
-}</code></pre>
<p>This stack script does a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--compile</code> and <code>--copy-bins</code> create a binary executable based on the file name.<br>
</li>
<li>installs ghc, if needed with <code>install-ghc</code><br>
</li>
<li>builds the scripts with the set of packages from <code>lts-14.17</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle">tutle</a>, we get a portable way to to run external shell commands, and I was able to create a nice haskell program to replace the shell script I used to automate the server tasks needed to deploy this blog!<br>
The basics my deploy turtle script are as follows, and you can see the <a href="https://gist.github.com/adamwespiser/25b0af28529a6de1272af6af6275f2a4#file-updatesite-hs">full example on github here</a></p>
<pre><code>import qualified Turtle as Tu
import qualified Control.Foldl as L
import qualified Data.Text as T
import Control.Concurrent.Async
import System.IO

argParser :: Tu.Parser Tu.FilePath
argParser = Tu.argPath "html" "html destination directory"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- 53 files copied over into destinationDir
  hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering
  destinationDir &lt;- Tu.options "Build blog and copy to directory" argParser
  Tu.with (Tu.mktempdir "/tmp" "deploy") (mainLoop destinationDir)</code></pre>
<p>One nice thing about turtle is the <code>Tu.with</code> function, which lets use run our the main logic of our program with a temporary directory which is subsequently cleaned up after the <code>mainLoop</code> function returns.<br>
Despite turtle being a handy library, I did find some downsides - Use of <code>FilePath</code>, which uses a pretty clunky, <code>String</code> based file representation - Often times clunkier semantics than just writing bash: for instance, <code>cp -r SRC TRG</code> is requires a fold over the result of <code>ls SRC</code> and construction of an explicit <code>cp</code> with each file, instead, you need to use <code>cptree</code>, which took me a while to figure out, so it would be nice if the semantics matched better! - Turtle is a monolithic framework for interacting with OS through a set of mirrored shell commands trying to match <code>coreutiles</code>, and it’s tightly couple parts makes it not very easy to pick the parts you like, and disregard the rest!</p>
<h4 id="using-stack-script-to-run-ghci">Using stack script to run ghci</h4>
<p>We’ve already seen a few examples of stack script, but there is one more that should be in every Haskeller’s toolkit. Stack script can be used to launch a ghci repl. Let’s say we are working with a new ADT, and want to write a new QuickCheck instance, how can stack script help us?<br>
The following header will load the listed packages into a ghci repl:</p>
<pre><code>{- stack 
 --resolver nightly
 --install-ghc
 exec ghci
 --package "QuickCheck checkers"
-}
module XTest where</code></pre>
<p>There is one note to make here about the order of the arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file will compile, then drop you into with module <code>XTest</code> is loaded</li>
<li>If <code>exec ghci</code> does not immediately follow <code>stack</code>, then the <code>--packages</code> must be before <code>exec ghci</code></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="ghcid">ghcid</h5>
<p>You can run the above stack script with <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid">ghcid</a> to get nearly instant compiler feedback using the following:</p>
<pre><code>bash$ ghcid -c "stack XTest.hs"</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I often find myself coding up small Haskell snippets, whether it’s playing around with a new data type, trying out a library, or reproducing an example from a paper or a book. In these cases, Stack’ scripting feature shines at giving me a self contained file where I can specify the dependencies via a snapshot in the file header, and not have to worry about breaking changes, or setting up a project with all the correct dependencies. Thus, I would urge my fellow Haskellers to consider using stack’s scripting feature when they share code online, to help others run their code today, and keep that way far into the future!</p>

  <p>Sep 20, 2020</p>
  <p>I’ve recently read an article criticizing Rust, and, while it made a bunch of good points, I didn’t enjoy it — it was an easy to argue with piece.
In general, I feel that I can’t recommend an article criticizing Rust.
This is a shame — confronting drawbacks is important, and debunking low effort/miss informed attempts at critique sadly inoculates against actually good arguments.</p>
<p>So, here’s my attempt to argue <em>against</em> Rust:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>Not All Programming is Systems Programming</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language.
It offers precise control over data layout and runtime behavior of the code, granting  you maximal performance and flexibility.
Unlike other systems programming languages, it also provides memory safety — buggy programs terminate in a well-defined manner, instead of unleashing (potentially security-sensitive) undefined behavior.</p>
<p>However, in many (most) cases, one doesn’t need ultimate performance or control over hardware resources.
For these situations, modern managed languages like Kotlin or Go offer decent speed, enviable
<a href="https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/system/files/presentation-slides/highperformancemanagedlanguages.pdf">time to performance</a>, and are memory safe by virtue of using a garbage collector for dynamic memory management.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Complexity</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Programmer’s time is valuable, and, if you pick Rust, expect to spend some of it on learning the ropes.
Rust community poured a lot of time into creating high-quality teaching materials, but the Rust language <em>is</em> big.
Even if a Rust implementation would provide value for you, you might not have resources to invest into growing the language expertise.</p>
<p>Rust’s price for improved control is the curse of choice:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Bar</span>         <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Bar</span>     <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>     <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Arc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Kotlin, you write <code>class Foo(val bar: Bar)</code>, and proceed with solving your business problem.
In Rust, there are choices to be made, some important enough to have dedicated syntax.</p>
<p>All this complexity is there for a reason — we don’t know how to create a simpler memory safe low-level language.
But not every task requires a low-level language to solve it.</p>

<p>Compile times are a multiplier for everything.
A program written in a slower to run but faster to compile programming language can be <em>faster</em> to run because the programmer will have more time to optimize!</p>
<p>Rust intentionally picked slow compilers in the <a href="https://research.swtch.com/generic">generics dilemma</a>.
This is not necessary the end of the world (the resulting runtime performance improvements are real), but it does mean that you’ll have to fight tooth and nail for reasonable build times in larger projects.</p>
<p><code>rustc</code> implements what is probably the most advanced <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/queries/incremental-compilation.html">incremental compilation</a> algorithm in production compilers, but this feels a bit like fighting with language compilation model.</p>
<p>Unlike C++, Rust build is not embarrassingly parallel; the amount of parallelism is limited by length of the critical path in the dependency graph.
If you have 40+ cores to compile, this shows.</p>
<p>Rust also lacks an analog for the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl">pimpl</a> idiom, which means that changing a crate requires recompiling (and not just relinking) all of its reverse dependencies.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Five years old, Rust is definitely a young language.
Even though its future looks bright, I will bet more money on “C will be around in ten years” than on “Rust will be around in ten years”
(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a>).
If you are writing software to last decades, you should seriously consider risks associated with picking new technologies.
(But keep in mind that picking Java over Cobol for banking software in 90s retrospectively turned out to be the right choice).</p>
<p>There’s only one complete implementation of Rust — the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"><code>rustc</code></a> compiler.
The most advanced alternative implementation, <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>, purposefully omits many static safety checks.
<code>rustc</code> at the moment supports only a single production-ready backend — LLVM.
Hence, its support for CPU architectures is narrower than that of C, which has GCC implementation as well as a number of vendor specific proprietary compilers.</p>
<p>Finally, Rust lacks an official specification.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/">The reference</a> is a work in progress, and does not yet document all the fine implementation details.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Alternatives</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>There are other languages besides Rust in systems programming space, notably, C, C++, and Ada.</p>
<p>Modern C++ provides <a href="https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/">tools</a> and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">guidelines</a> for improving safety.
There’s even a proposal for a Rust-like <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/docs/Lifetime.pdf">lifetimes</a> mechanism!
Unlike Rust, using these tools does not <em>guarantee</em> the absence of memory safety issues.
However, if you already maintain a large body of C++ code, it makes sense to check if following best practices and using <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">sanitizers</a> helps with security issues.
This is hard, but clearly is easier than rewriting in another language!</p>
<p>If you use C, you can use formal methods to <a href="https://sel4.systems/Info/FAQ/proof.pml">prove</a> the absence of undefined behaviors, or just <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">exhaustively test</a> everything.</p>
<p>Ada is memory safe if you don’t use dynamic memory (never call <code>free</code>).</p>
<p>Rust is an interesting point on the cost/safety curve, but is far from the only one!</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Tooling</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust tooling is a bit of a hit and miss.
The baseline tooling, the compiler and the build system
(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">cargo</a>), are often cited as best in class.</p>
<p>But, for example, some runtime-related tools (most notably, heap profiling) are just absent — it’s hard to reflect on the runtime of the program if there’s no runtime!
Additionally, while IDE support is decent, it is nowhere near the Java-level of reliability.
Automated complex refactors of multi-million line programs are not possible in Rust today.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Integration</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Whatever the Rust promise is, it’s a fact of life that today’s systems programming world speaks C, and is inhabited by C and C++.
Rust intentionally doesn’t try to mimic these languages — it doesn’t use C++-style classes or C ABI.</p>
<p>That means that integration between the worlds needs explicit bridges.
These are not seamless.
They are <code>unsafe</code>, not always completely zero-cost and need to be synchronized between the languages.
While the general promise of <a href="http://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/how-to-riir/">piece-wise integration</a> holds up and the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">tooling</a> catches up, there is accidental complexity along the way.</p>
<p>One specific gotcha is that Cargo’s opinionated world view (which <em>is</em> a blessing for pure Rust projects) might make it harder to integrate with a bigger build system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>“Using LLVM” is not a universal solution to all performance problems.
While I am not aware of benchmarks comparing performance of C++ and Rust at scale, it’s not to hard to come up with a list of cases where Rust leaves some performance on the table relative to C++.</p>
<p>The biggest one is probably the fact that Rust’s move semantics is based on values (<code>memcpy</code> at the machine code level).
In contrast, C++ semantics uses special references you can steal data from (pointers at the machine code level).
In theory, compiler should be able to see through chain of copies; in practice it often doesn’t: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077">#57077</a>.
A related problem is the absence of placement new — Rust sometimes need to copy bytes to/from the stack, while C++ can construct the thing in place.</p>
<p>Somewhat amusingly, Rust’s default ABI (which is not stable, to make it as efficient as possible) is sometimes worse than that of C: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26494#issuecomment-619506345">#26494</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while in theory Rust code should be more efficient due to the significantly richer aliasing information, enabling aliasing-related optimizations triggers LLVM bugs and miscompilations: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878">#54878</a>.</p>
<p>But, to reiterate, these are cherry-picked examples, sometimes the field is tilted the other way.
For example, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHIkrotSwcc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1261">has a performance problem</a> which Rust’s <code>Box</code> lacks.</p>
<p>A potentially bigger issue is that Rust, with its definition time checked generics, is less expressive than C++.
So, some C++ <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Expression_templates">template tricks</a> for high performance are not expressible in Rust using a nice syntax.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Meaning of Unsafe</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>An idea which is even more core to Rust than ownership &amp; borrowing is perhaps that of <code>unsafe</code> boundary.
That, by delineating all dangerous operations behind <code>unsafe</code> blocks and functions and insisting on providing a safe higher-level interface to them, it is possible to create a system which is both</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sound (non-<code>unsafe</code> code can’t cause undefined behavior),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and modular (different <code>unsafe</code> blocks can be checked separately).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>It’s pretty clear that the promise works out in practice: <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case">fuzzing Rust code</a> unearths panics, not buffer overruns.</p>
<p>But the theoretical outlook is not as rosy.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, there’s no definition of Rust memory model, so it is impossible to formally check if a given unsafe block is valid or not.
There’s informal definition of “things rustc does or might rely on” and in in-progress <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">runtime verifier</a>, but the actual model is in flux.
So there might be some <code>unsafe</code> code somewhere which works OK in practice today, might be declared invalid tomorrow, and broken by a new compiler optimization next year.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, there’s also an observation that <code>unsafe</code> blocks are not, in fact, modular.
Sufficiently powerful <code>unsafe</code> blocks can, in effect, extend the language.
Two such extensions might be fine in isolation, but lead to undefined behavior if used simultaneously:
<a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/10/02/observational-equivalence-and-unsafe-code/">Observational equivalence and unsafe code</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here are some thing I’ve deliberately omitted from the list:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economics (“it’s harder to hire Rust programmers”) — I feel that the “maturity” section captures the essence of it which is not reducible to chicken and egg problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies (“stdlib is too small / everything has too many deps”) — given how good Cargo and the relevant parts of the language are, I personally don’t see this as a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic linking (“Rust should have stable ABI”) — I don’t think this is a strong argument. Monomorphization is pretty fundamentally incompatible with dynamic linking and there’s C ABI if you really need to. I do think that the situation here can be improved, <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/a-stable-modular-abi-for-rust/12347/10?u=matklad">but I don’t think that improvement needs to be Rust-specific</a>.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b> Puma 5 is a huge major release for the project. It brings several new experimental performance features, along with tons of bugfixes and features. Let's talk about some of the most important ones. <i>(1839 words / 7 minutes)</i>
</p>
<p>Puma 5 (codename Spoony Bard<sup>1</sup><span>(When Puma gets a new ‘supercontributor’ that submits lots of important work to the project, we let them name the next release.

Will said: ‘Final Fantasy IV is especially nostalgic for me, the first big open-source project I ever worked on was a fan re-translation of the game back in the late 90s.’</span>) was released today (my birthday!). There’s a lot going on in this release, so I wanted to talk about the different features and changes to give Puma users confidence in upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-performance-features-for-cluster-mode-on-mri">Experimental Performance Features For Cluster Mode on MRI</h2>
<p>This is probably the headline of the release - two features for reducing memory usage, and one for reducing latency.</p>
<p>Puma 5 contains 3 new experimental performance features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> config. This may reduce latency on MRI through inserting a small delay (sleep sort!) before re-listening on the socket if worker is busy. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce latency in high-load (&gt;50% utilization) Puma clusters.</li>
<li><code>fork_worker</code> option and <code>refork</code> command for reduced memory usage by forking from a worker process instead of the master process. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
<li>Added <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> config option. Reduce memory usage in preloaded cluster-mode apps by GCing before fork and compacting, where available. Intended result: If enabled, should reduce memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiments are only for <strong>cluster mode</strong> Puma configs running on <strong>MRI</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re calling them <em>experimental</em> because we’re not sure if they’ll actually have any benefit. We’re pretty sure they’re stable and won’t break anything, but we’re not sure they’re actually going to have big benefits in the real world. People’s workloads are often not what we anticipate, and synthetic benchmarks are usually not of any help in figuring out if a change will be beneficial or not.</p>
<p>We do not believe any of the new features will have a negative effect or impact the stability of your application. This is either a “it works” or “it does nothing” experiment.</p>
<p>If any of the features turn out to be particularly beneficial, we may make them defaults in future versions of Puma.</p>
<p><strong>If you upgrade and try any of the 3 new features, please post before and after results or screenshots to <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2258">this Github issue</a>.</strong> “It didn’t do anything” is still a useful report in this case. Posting ~24 hours of “before” and ~24 hours of “after” data would be most helpful.</p>
<h3 id="wait_for_less_busy_worker-sleep-sort-for-faster-apps">wait_for_less_busy_worker: sleep sort for faster apps?!</h3>
<p>This feature was contributed to Puma by Gitlab. Turn it on by adding <code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> to your Puma config.</p>
<p>When a request comes in to a Puma cluster, the operating system randomly selects a listening, free Puma worker process to pick up the request. “Listening” and “free” being the key words - a Puma process will only listen to the socket (and pick up more requests) if it has nothing else to do. However, when running Puma with multiple threads, Puma will also listen on the socket when all of its busy threads are waiting on I/O or have otherwise released <a href="https://www.speedshop.co/2020/09/17/2020/05/11/the-ruby-gvl-and-scaling.html">the Global VM Lock</a>.</p>
<p>When Gitlab investigated switching from Unicorn to Puma, they encountered an issue with this behavior. Under high load with moderate thread settings (a max pool size of 5 in their case), average request latency increased. Why?</p>
<p>Remember, I said that the operating system <em>randomly</em> assigns a request to a <em>listening</em> worker process. So, it will never send a request to a worker process that’s busy doing other things, but what about a worker process that’s got 4 threads that are processing other requests, but all 4 of those threads happen to be waiting on I/O right now?</p>
<p>Imagine a Puma cluster with 3 workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker 1: 0/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 2: 1/5 threads busy.</li>
<li>Worker 3: 4/5 threads busy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Worker 3’s 4 active threads happen to all have released the GVL, allowing that worker to listen to the socket, and a new request comes in - which worker process should we assign the request to, ideally? Worker 1, right? Unfortunately, most operating systems will assign the request to Worker 3 33% of the time.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? We want the operating system to prefer less-loaded workers. It would be really cool if we could sort the list of workers listening on the socket so that the operating system would give requests to the least-loaded worker. Well, we can’t really do that easily, but we can do something else.</p>
<p><code>wait_for_less_busy_worker</code> causes a worker to <em>wait</em> to re-listen on the socket if it’s thread pool isn’t completely empty. This means that in high-load scenarios, the operating system will assign requests to less-loaded workers.</p>
<p><strong>This is basically sleep-sorting our workers</strong>. We’re kind of doing doing this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>[].tap { |a| workers.map { |e| Thread.new{ sleep worker_busyness.to_f/1000; a &lt;&lt; e} }.each{|t| t.join} }
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… and hiding “more loaded” workers from the operating system by letting less-loaded workers listen first!</p>
<p>Originally the proposal was for a more complicated sort - processes slept longer if they had more busy threads - but that was removed when it was found that a simpler on/off sleep was just as effective.</p>
<p>The net effect is that in high-load scenarios, request latency decreases. This is because workers with more busy threads are slower than workers with no busy threads. We’re assuring that requests get assigned to the faster workers. Prior to this patch, Gitlab saw an increase in latency using Puma compared to Unicorn - after this patch, latency was the same (they also were able to reduce their fleet size by almost 30% thanks to Puma’s memory-saving multithreaded design).</p>
<p>There may be even more efficient ways for us to implement this behavior in the future. There’s some magic you can do with <code>libev</code>, I’m pretty sure, or we can just implement a different sleep/wait strategy.</p>
<h3 id="fork_worker">fork_worker</h3>
<p>Adding <code>fork_worker</code> to your puma.rb config file (or <code>--fork-worker</code> from the CLI) turns on this feature. This mode causes Puma to fork additional workers from worker 0, instead of directly from the master process:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>10000   \_ puma 5.0.0 (tcp://0.0.0.0:9292) [puma]
10001       \_ puma: cluster worker 0: 10000 [puma]
10002           \_ puma: cluster worker 1: 10000 [puma]
10003           \_ puma: cluster worker 2: 10000 [puma]
10004           \_ puma: cluster worker 3: 10000 [puma]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similar to the <code>preload_app!</code> option, the <code>fork_worker</code> option allows your application to be initialized only once for copy-on-write memory savings, and it has two additional advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compatible with phased restart.</strong> Because the master process itself doesn’t preload the application, this mode works with phased restart (<code>SIGUSR1</code> or <code>pumactl phased-restart</code>), unlike <code>preload_app!</code>. When worker 0 reloads as part of a phased restart, it initializes a new copy of your application first, then the other workers reload by forking from this new worker already containing the new preloaded application.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows a phased restart to complete as quickly as a hot restart (<code>SIGUSR2</code> or <code>pumactl restart</code>), while still minimizing downtime by staggering the restart across cluster workers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>‘Refork’ for additional copy-on-write improvements in running applications.</strong> Fork-worker mode introduces a new <code>refork</code> command that re-loads all nonzero workers by re-forking them from worker 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>This command can potentially improve memory utilization in large or complex applications that don’t fully pre-initialize on startup, because the re-forked workers can share copy-on-write memory with a worker that has been running for a while and serving requests.</p>
<p>You can trigger a refork by sending the cluster the <code>SIGURG</code> signal or running the <code>pumactl refork</code> command at any time. A refork will also automatically trigger once, after a certain number of requests have been processed by worker 0 (default 1000). To configure the number of requests before the auto-refork, pass a positive integer argument to <code>fork_worker</code> (e.g., <code>fork_worker 1000</code>), or <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="nakayoshi_fork">nakayoshi_fork</h3>
<p>Add <code>nakayoshi_fork</code> to your puma.rb config to try this option.</p>
<p>Nakayoshi means “friendly”, so this is a “friendly fork”. The concept was <a href="https://github.com/ko1/nakayoshi_fork">originally implemented by MRI supercontributor Koichi Sasada</a> in a gem, but we wanted to see if we could bring a simpler version into Puma.</p>
<p>Basically, we just do the following before forking a worker:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>4</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>{</span> <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span> <span>}</span>
<span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>compact</span> <span># if available</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The concept here is that we’re trying to get as clean of a Ruby heap as possible before forking to maximize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a> benefits. That should, in turn, lead to reduced memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="other-new-features">Other New Features</h2>
<p>A few more things in the grab-bag:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now compile Puma on machines where OpenSSL is not installed.</li>
<li>There is now a <code>thread-backtraces</code> command in pumactl to print all active threads backtraces. This has been available via SIGINFO on Darwin, but now it works on Linux via this new command.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats</code> now has a <code>requests_count</code> counter.</li>
<li><code>lowlevel_error_handler</code> got some enhancements - we also pass the status code to it now.</li>
<li>Phased restarts and worker timeouts should be faster.</li>
<li><code>Puma.stats_hash</code> provides Puma statistics as a hash, rather than as JSON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loads-of-bugfixes">Loads of Bugfixes</h2>
<p>The number of bugfixes in this release is pretty huge. Here’s the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdowns should be more reliable.</li>
<li>Issues surrounding socket closing on shutdown have been resolved.</li>
<li>Fixed some concurrency …</li></ul></article></div></div></div>

<p>
The version of the Pinephone that I am reviewing is the postmarketOS
Community Edition (CE).

</p>
<h2>First Impressions</h2>
<p>
My first impression of the Pinephone after I unboxed the device was
very good. I enjoyed the feeling of the weight of the Pinephone in my
hand, and the overall build quality of the system still impresses
me. It is my opinion that the PINE64 hardware development and
manufacturing process is very solid. For what I paid, which was about
AUD$200 all up, I believe I have received hardware that is superior
than a phone that I could have bought from a retail store in my city
for the same price.

The screen is glossy, and the capacitive touch screen (this is a
question fellow smolnet citizen Shufei wanted answered in some detail)
responds well.

I was, however, disappointed with the stock postmarketOS software that
came flashed on the eMMC. The Software Centre was a particular
disappointment. It, by default, only showed the currently installed
software, and it was not possible to browse any other software which
was not already installed.

Also, the camera application that came installed by default, 'Cheese',
did not allow the camera to function.

I attempted to install Plasma Mobile using the command line, following
these instructions:

</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Plasma_Mobile">https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Plasma_Mobile</a></p><p>
But it ended up completely wrecking the function of the
phone. Installing the package that the wiki article recommended did
not update LightDM, and I ended up soft-bricking the phone while
fiddling with the LightDM configuration in order to stop the phone
from (still) booting into phosh, and not Plasma Mobile.

It also disabled cell data functionality, and ended up messing with a
lot of the guts of the Linux installation. So I do not recommend
attempting to switch to Plasma Mobile on the Pinephone from inside an
already-existing postmarketOS installation. I recommend getting a
Plasma Mobile system image, and flashing that from the start if you
wish to experiment with different user interfaces.

<p>
There is a great many Linux distributions available for the
Pinephone. The following link to the PINE64 wiki contains a
more-or-less exhaustive list of each of them:

</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone_Software_Releases">https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone_Software_Releases</a></p><p>
The Linux distributions that I tested out are:

</p>
<h3>postmarketOS (phosh UI)</h3>
<p>
I enjoyed this system image because it came with a wizard for
NetworkManager which enabled me to make sure cell data worked most
consistently. However, the power consumption of this image was
prohibitively high, and it caused the phone to run very hot. When the
battery was at 10% charge, rebooting the phone would cause the last of
this precious charge to be used up, and the phone would run completely
out of power.

</p>
<h3>postmarketOS (GNOME)</h3>
<p>
This image was basically a desktop UI, and did not have many, if any
mobile UI configurations present. It was rather fun to see the
Pinephone boot into a full GNOME desktop environment. I imagine if you
had a bigger screen connected to the Pinephone, you would be quite
impressed with what this phone could pull off.

</p>
<h3>postmarketOS (Plasma Mobile)</h3>
<p>
Slow and buggy, really.

</p>
<h3>Ubuntu Touch</h3>
<p>
This distribution has a major problem at the moment: the unlock/power
button is not properly debounced, and it makes it virtually impossible
sometimes to unlock the phone. Otherwise, this distribution is very,
very impressive, and I would actually like to switch to it, because
cell data works best for Optus on Ubuntu Touch.

This distribution could indeed be a daily driver for someone if they
could sort out the button debouncing problem.

</p>
<h3>SailfishOS</h3>
<p>
This is a Linux-based operating system that uses a closed-source
UI. It was so glossy and locked-down in terms of configurability that
I was turned off using it. It has a great tutorial for teaching you
the gestures you need to learn in order to use the touch screen.

I did like the fact that it organised all your contacts and messages
into interesting metaphors, and it ran reasonably quickly, but there
is no way of configuring the UI beyond what how it arrives to you.

</p>
<h3>Manjaro ARM</h3>
<p>
This image was fairly slow to run on the Pinephone, but in my opinion
it is the absolute best demonstration of KDE Plasma Mobile. It was
very visually impressive, and the menus were full-featured and
informative. It did not, however, support phone calls or SMS.

</p>
<h3>Mobian</h3>
<p>
This is my current choice of Linux distribution for the phone. It has
a software centre full of different and interesting programs,
including Transmission (torrent client) and GIMP (!!! I have yet to
install this to see how or if it works well, but the fact that it is
possible to at least _run_ GIMP in some capacity on the Pinephone
would like like running Adobe Photoshop on a Samsung Galaxy).

This is merely anecdotal, and I have not performed any scientific
tests to work out if this is true, but the latest September 2020
stable release of this image seems to have the best power settings of
any of the other distributions for this phone.

I hesitate to give an estimate of exactly how long this phone will
last on a single charge, given normal use. But, I finished charging
this phone at 0700HRS this morning, and, with no other charge, it is now
on 50% charge, and the current time is 1230HRS. I think I have put the
phone through a little heavier use than I do normally, this morning,
however.

Virtually all of the functions of the phone are enabled without any
configuration in Mobian.

</p>
<h3>Multi-boot Image</h3>
<p>
I highly recommend flashing the following system image to an SD card
so you can try out all the major Linux distributions for your phone:

</p>
<p><a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot-demo/">https://xnux.eu/p-boot-demo/</a></p><p>
It contains 13 different distributions, and it is trivial to switch
between each of them through the main boot menu.

</p>
<h2>Mobile Phone Calls</h2>
<p>
I have rung a few people on the phone, and, assuming you have a
distribution flashed on the phone that supports phonecalls (like the
one I am currently using, Mobian), there should be absolutely no issue
using this fundamental feature of the Pinephone.

</p>
<h2>Cell Data</h2>
<p>
For the most part, the cell data modem in the Pinephone works well for
me. There is a fairly large problem with my use of the Pinephone with
its cell data, however.

I live in Australia, and the mobile phone carrier that I use is
Optus. The setup(s) that work for me with my Pinephone, running
Mobian, is:

</p>
<blockquote> Name: 1
 APN: yesinternet</blockquote>

<blockquote> Name: Optus Yes Internet
 APN: yesinternet</blockquote>
<p>
After about 3 or 4 hours after I boot up the phone, the cell data
stops working, and the Network Mode in the 'Mobile' submenu of
Settings changes from

</p>
<blockquote> 2G, 3G, 4G (Preferred)</blockquote>
<p>
to just

</p>
<blockquote> 2G, 3G, 4G</blockquote>
<p>
This issue is fixed for another 3 or 4 hours by rebooting the phone,
which does not actually take that long (about 10 to 15 seconds), but
it is a hassle to be cut off from mobile data if you forget about your
phone.

These two links help shed light on exactly what is happening with the
Pinephone when it tries to remain connected to the Optus network:

</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.gl-inet.com/t/using-rooter-on-the-gl-x750/8983/4">https://forum.gl-inet.com/t/using-rooter-on-the-gl-x750/8983/4</a></p><p>
(A forum post. Someone using a similar, if not identical mobile data
modem as the Pinephone in Australia, with the Optus network)

</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/Juul/e42c5b6ec71ce11923526b36d3f1cb2c">https://gist.github.com/Juul/e42c5b6ec71ce11923526b36d3f1cb2c</a></p><p>
(A Github post which familiarises the reader with the concepts and
command line tools involved in using Linux with 4G LTE modems on
Debian and Ubuntu)

The issue with the Pinephone is explained the forum thread (the first
link). The issue is that there are at least two modes for the Quectel
EG25 modem that the Pinephone uses, only one of which seems to be
supported by Optus. The two modes are QMI and MBIM. Optus, I assume,
only supoprts MBIM:

https://forum.gl-inet.com/t/using-rooter-on-the-gl-x750/8983/8 Forum post

The relevant sentence from the above forum post is:

</p>
<blockquote> Also, MBIM is buggy for Quectel modems even in OpenWRT 19.07
 (snapshot), mostly sometimes modem “freezes” and I need to restart.</blockquote>
<p>
The issue that the original poster was having with this modem is
explained in the same post:

</p>
<blockquote> The reason is exactly this: user.notice Create Connection:
 WDA-GET-DATA-FORMAT is “raw-ip”</blockquote>

<blockquote> When you use a modem over QMI and the data-format is “raw-ip” the
 system needs to know that modem is on “raw-ip”, without that,
 interface doesn’t get an IP address.</blockquote>
<p>
When I was using the postmarketOS version of phosh, the NetworkManager
program started a wizard which contained a lot more options about how
to configure the Pinephone's Quectel LTE modem. One activity I would
like to carry out is learning how to start this wizard from within
Mobian. I wish to keep Mobian as the primary operating system for the
Pinephone just because its Software Centre has such an amazing
quantity and quality of different programs, and the postmarketOS
Centre requires you to manually search for the programs you want, in
order for them to show up at all inside the Centre.

</p>
<h2>GPS</h2>
<p>
The GPS seems to function perfectly fine inside the default Mobian
maps program. It can show you, with reasonable accuracy (although not
to the same accuracy as, say, a proprietary maps application) exactly
where you are. I think the accuracy of the GPS on the Pinephone is
somewhere in the region of 10 square metres.

The main issue with the GPS, however, is that it does not currently
link in with the Perth public transport system. I cannot use this
program to plan public transport journeys. But I believe I should be
able to take care of this problem by either (a) adding data to
OpenStreetMap, or (b) using a web browser, where I should be able to
access the Transperth public transport trip planner webpage.

</p>
<h2>Text Messages (SMS)</h2>
<p>
This is a feature that works without a hitch in Mobian. I was
surprised to see myself receiving SMS messages unexpectedly from
friends as I left the phone in my pocket and forgot about it.

</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>
The camera application in Mobian works. However it has a …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’ve written about <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/exploration" target="_blank">exploration and exploitation</a> before, but I realized recently that this may be more important than I thought. Talking to a friend about what different people thought about what role effort vs. innate ability played in success, I went down my list of successes and ended up realizing that the only “difficult” part (in the sense of “part I was closest to not doing”) was actually getting up and doing things outside my normal routine.</p><p>For example, here’s a list of the things that have led to my biggest wins so far:</p><ul><li>trying out contra dancing in middle school</li><li>joining <a href="http://harvardhip.org/" target="_blank">Harvard High-Impact Philanthropy</a></li><li>interning at Fog Creek Software</li><li>being president of HHIP</li><li>starting <a href="http://harvard-class.com/" target="_blank">Harvard Class</a></li><li>starting a blog</li><li>going to a <a href="http://rationality.org/" target="_blank">CFAR</a> workshop</li><li>going to the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/" target="_blank">EA summit</a></li><li>running an <a href="http://harvardhip.org/events/" target="_blank">EA speaker series</a> this semester</li></ul><p>I’d say these were about 25% effort, 25% ability, and 50% “luck” from doing lots of things outside my normal experience.</p><p>At a guess, the reason doing lots of different things is so important is that it simply exposes you to more potential random “strokes of luck”. When you do a thing, often lots of the exposure to luck comes from the first relatively small bit of effort you put in. For instance, if I turned out not to like contra dancing, I could have stopped going, so it was a pretty small cost for a large potential upside.</p><p>This stuff compounds, too. The more you do stuff, the more “luck” you get, which helps you do more stuff, etc. In other words, it seems like the main factor in success is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment" target="_blank">preferential attachment</a> process, which explains why there’s such a power-law distribution and why similar people often end up with such wildly different outcomes: relatively small differences in initial conditions, caused by noise, can blow up to huge effects later.</p><p>Notes on this theory:</p><ol><li>Some predictions: people who experience more different things will ceteris paribus succeed more. For example, for college graduates, life outcomes later will be correlated with diversity of the things they did over their summers. Success might be correlated with number of different places you lived growing up (there are lots of confounders here of course). A supporting piece of evidence here is <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/satvik" target="_blank">Satvik’s assertion</a> to me that “Statistically, CEOs of large companies tend to have worked in multiple areas during their early career at a rate far higher than baseline.”</li><li>I’d guess that the preferential attachment process starts gaining significance almost as soon as the person starts getting agency, which can be as early as, I don’t know, three or four? There’s a famous story about Elon Musk when he was maybe six years old and loved to go visit his cousin who lived across town. One day he was grounded and his parents wouldn’t take him to visit his cousin, so he escaped and wandered around the town himself until he found his cousin’s house. That’s the kind of doing-things-ness that can compound ridiculously.</li><li>I think I’m probably better (comparatively) at Actually Doing Things than I am at putting in effort, but that even still, the returns from spending more attention on Actually Doing Things are probably higher than spending that attention on putting in effort. Unfortunately, this is hard to convince myself of in a way that actually compels me to act, for reasons I’ve mentioned <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/exploration" target="_blank">previously</a>.</li><li>If this theory is true, it has some implications for my behavior: I should be spending less time on classes, taking more variety of classes (this will be easier in the future as I’ve basically finished my major), try to get rid of my most time-consuming commitments (e.g. get someone else to run HHIP next year), and generally say “yes” to more things. <del>The college</del> Harvard’s environment is set up pretty poorly for this, inasmuch as I have to spend 20-30 hours a week thinking about math.</li></ol></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Transformers have become the defacto standard for NLP tasks nowadays.</p>
<p>While the Transformer architecture was introduced with NLP, they are now being used in Computer Vision and to generate music as well. I am sure you would all have heard about the GPT3 Transformer and its applications thereof.</p>
<p><em><strong>But all these things aside, they are still hard to understand as ever.</strong></em></p>
<p>It has taken me multiple readings through the Google research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf">paper</a> that first introduced transformers along with just so many blog posts to really understand how a transformer works.</p>
<p>So, I thought of putting the whole idea down in as simple words as possible and with some very basic Math and some puns as I am a proponent of having some fun while learning. I will try to keep both the jargon and the technicality to a minimum, yet it is such a topic that I could only do so much. And my goal is to make the reader understand even the most gory details of Transformer by the end of this post.</p>
<p><em><strong>Also, this is officially my longest post both in terms of time taken to write it as well as length of the post. Hence, I will advice you to Grab A Coffee.</strong></em> ☕️</p>
<p>So, here goes — This post will be a highly conversational one and it is about “<em><strong>Decoding The Transformer”.</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q: So, Why should I even understand Transformer?</strong></em></p>
<p>In the past, the LSTM and GRU architecture(as explained here in my past <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-learning-series-part-3-attention-cnn-and-what-not-for-text-classification-4313930ed566">post</a> on NLP) along with attention mechanism used to be the State of the Art Approach for Language modeling problems (put very simply, predict the next word) and Translation systems. But, the main problem with these architectures is that they are recurrent in nature, and the runtime increases as the sequence length increases. That is, these architectures take a sentence and process each word in a <em><strong>sequential</strong></em> way, and hence with the increase in sentence length the whole runtime increases.</p>
<p>Transformer, a model architecture first explained in the paper Attention is all you need, lets go of this recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. And that makes it FAST.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/0.png" alt="<a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf&quot;>Source</a>">
<figcaption>From the Paper</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the picture of the full transformer as taken from the paper. And, it surely is intimidating. So, I will aim to demystify it in this post by going through each individual piece. So read ahead.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h2>
<p><em><strong>Q: That sounds interesting. So, what does a transformer do exactly?</strong></em></p>
<p>Essentially, a transformer can perform almost any NLP task. It can be used for language modeling, Translation, or Classification as required, and it does it fast by removing the sequential nature of the problem. So, the transformer in a machine translation application would convert one language to another, or for a classification problem will provide the class probability using an appropriate output layer.</p>
<p>It all will depend on the final outputs layer for the network but, the Transformer basic structure will remain quite the same for any task. For this particular post, I will be continuing with the machine translation example.</p>
<p>So from a very high place, this is how the transformer looks for a translation task. It takes as input an English sentence and returns a German sentence.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/1.png" alt="Transformer for Translation">
<figcaption>Transformer for Translation</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="the-building-blocks">The Building Blocks</h2>
<p><em><strong>Q: That was too basic. <em>😎</em> Can you expand on it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Okay, just remember in the end, you asked for it. Let’s go a little deeper and try to understand what a transformer is composed of.</p>
<p>So, a transformer is essentially composed of a stack of encoder and decoder layers. The role of an encoder layer is to encode the English sentence into a numerical form using the attention mechanism, while the decoder aims to use the encoded information from the encoder layers to give the German translation for the particular English sentence.</p>
<p>In the figure below, the transformer is given as input an English sentence, which gets encoded using 6 encoder layers. The output from the final encoder layer then goes to each decoder layer to translate English to German.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Data Flow in a Transformer</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="1-encoder-architecture">1. Encoder Architecture</h2>
<p><em><strong>Q: That’s alright but, how does an encoder stack encode an English sentence exactly?</strong></em></p>
<p>Patience, I am getting to it. So, as I said the encoder stack contains six encoder layers on top of each other(As given in the paper, but the future versions of transformers use even more layers). And each encoder in the stack has essentially two main layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>a multi-head self-attention Layer, and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/3.png" alt="Very basic encoder Layer">
<figcaption>Very basic encoder Layer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They are a mouthful. Right? Don’t lose me yet as I will explain both of them in the coming sections. Right now, just remember that the encoder layer incorporates attention and a position-wise feed-forward network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: But, how does this layer expect its inputs to be?</strong></em></p>
<p>This layer expects its inputs to be of the shape <code>SxD</code> (as shown in the figure below) where <code>S</code> is the source sentence(English Sentence) length, and <code>D</code> is the dimension of the embedding whose weights can be trained with the network. In this post, we will be using D as 512 by default throughout. While S will be the maximum length of sentence in a batch. So it normally changes with batches.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/4.png" alt="Encoder — Input and Output shapes are the same">
<figcaption>Encoder — Input and Output shapes are the same</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And what about the outputs of this layer? Remember that the encoder layers are stacked on top of each other. So, we want to be able to have an output of the same dimension as the input so that the output can flow easily into the next encoder. So the output is also of the shape, <code>SxD</code>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Enough about the sizes talk, I understand what goes in and what goes out but what actually happens in the Encoder layer?</strong></em></p>
<p>Okay, let’s go through the attention layer and the feedforward layer one by one:</p>
<h3 id="a-self-attention-layer">A) Self-attention layer</h3>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/5.png" alt="How Self-Attention Works">
<figcaption>How Self-Attention Works</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The above figure must look daunting but it is easy to understand. So just stay with me here.</p>
<p>Deep Learning is essentially nothing but a lot of matrix calculations and what we are essentially doing in this layer is a lot of matrix calculations intelligently. The self-attention layer initializes with 3 weight matrices — Query($W_q$), Key($W_k$), and Value($W_v$). Each of these matrices has a size of (<code>Dxd</code>) where d is taken as 64 in the paper. The weights for these matrices will be trained when we train the model.</p>
<p>In the first calculation(Calc 1 in the figure), we create matrices Q, K, and V by multiplying the input with the respective Query, Key, and Value matrix.</p>
<p>Till now it is trivial and shouldn’t make any sense, but it is at the second calculation where it gets interesting. Let’s try to understand the output of the softmax function. We start by multiplying the Q and Kᵀ matrix to get a matrix of size (<code>SxS</code>) and divide it by the scalar √d. We then take a softmax to make the rows sum to one.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we can think of the resultant <code>SxS</code> matrix as the contribution of each word in another word. For example, it might look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/6.png" alt="Softmax(QxKt/sqrt(d))">
<figcaption>After Softmax</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see the diagonal entries are big. This is because the word contribution to itself is high. That is reasonable. But we can see here that the word “quick” devolves into “quick” and “fox” and the word “brown” also devolves into “brown” and “fox”. That intuitively helps us to say that both the words — “quick” and “brown” each refers to the “fox”.</p>
<p>Once we have this SxS matrix with contributions we multiply this matrix by the Value matrix(Sxd) of the sentence and it gives us back a matrix of shape Sxd(4x64). So, what the operation actually does is that it replaces the embedding vector of a word like “quick” with say .75 x (quick embedding) and .2x(fox embedding) and thus now the resultant output for the word “quick” has attention embedded in itself.</p>
<p>Note that the output of this layer has the dimension (Sxd) and before we get done with the whole encoder we need to change it back to D=512 as we need the output of this encoder as the input of another encoder.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: But, you called this layer Multi-head self-attention Layer. What is the multi-head?</strong></em></p>
<p>Okay, my bad but in my defense, I was just getting to that.</p>
<p>It’s called a multi-head because we use many such self-attention layers in parallel. That is, we have many self-attention layers stacked on top of each other. The number of attention layers,h, is kept as 8 in the paper. So the input X goes through many self-attention layers parallelly, each of which gives a z matrix of shape (Sxd) = 4x64. We concatenate these 8(h) matrices and again apply a final output linear layer, $W_o$, of size DxD.</p>
<p>What size do we get? For the concatenate operation we get a size of SxD(4x(64x8) = 4x512). And multiplying this output by $W_o$, we get the final output Z with the shape of SxD(4x512) as desired.</p>
<p>Also, note the relation between h,d, and D i.e. h x d = D</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/7.png" alt="The Full multi-headed self-attention Layer">
<figcaption>The Full multi-headed self-attention Layer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Thus, we finally get the output Z of shape 4x512 as intended. But before it goes into another encoder we pass it through a Feed-Forward Network.</p>
<h3 id="b-position-wise-feed-forward-network">B) Position-wise feed-forward network</h3>
<p>Once we understand the multi-headed attention layer, the Feed-forward network is actually pretty easy to understand. It is just a combination of various linear and dropout layers on the output Z. Consequentially, it is again just a lot of Matrix multiplication here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/8.png" alt="Each word goes into the feed-forward network.">
<figcaption>Each word goes into the feed-forward network</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The feed-forward network applies itself to each position in the output Z parallelly(Each position can be thought of as a word) and hence the name Position-wise feed-forward network. The feed-forward network also shares weight, so that the length of the source sentence doesn’t matter(Also, if it didn’t share weights, we would have to initialize a lot of such networks based on max source sentence length and that is not feasible)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://mlwhiz.com/images/transformers/9.png" alt="It is actually just a linear layer that gets applied to each position(or word)">
<figcaption>It is actually just a linear layer that gets applied to each position(or word)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With this, we near an okayish understanding of the encoder part of the Transformer.</p>

<p>Say you have a Twitter account 🐦, <code>@alice</code>. Your friends Bob and Charlie have Twitter accounts too, <code>@bob</code> and <code>@charlie</code>. You can talk seamlessly to each other, but <em>only</em> on <code>twitter.com</code> and nowhere else. Bad.</p>
<p>Now, you have an email account 📧, <code>alice@gmail.com</code>. Your friends Bob and Charlie also have email accounts, <code>bob@hotmail.com</code> and <code>charlie@yahoo.com</code>. You all can talk from different websites. Great, but email sucks as social media.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this. You have a Fediverse account 🌟, <code>@alice@tweet.com</code>. Your friends Bob and Charlie also have Fediverse accounts, <code>@bob@toot.net</code> and <code>@charlie@social.org</code>. <strong>You all can talk seamlessly like Twitter, from anywhere like email.</strong> That’s the Fediverse, and it’s amazing.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?</h2>
<p>Like this. Microblogging, video sharing, photo sharing… And these Fediverse websites are <strong>all interconnected</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of Fediverse accounts “tweeting” to each other across different websites. Talk to anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>No more being tied down to a single place which abuses their power or your data. You decide were you reside.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-join">How do I join?</h2>
<p>Easiest way is to sign up to a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> instance (website/server) of your choice. If you’re feeling adventurous, browse <a href="https://fediverse.network/">Fediverse.network</a> for other Fediverse instances, including non-Mastodon ones. Remember, <strong>you can talk to anyone anywhere regardless of where they are on the Fediverse!</strong></p>

<p>Yes, plenty! Check out <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse.party</a> for a cool interactive guide. The Fediverse is a whole family of miraculously <strong>interconnected</strong> (federated) services.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise nobody trust the big monster tech giants (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) anymore. Why wait until the next case of them abusing your data, keeping permanent records, censoring arbitrarily, and manipulating your feed, when there is a better, thriving alternative? There’s no need to be kept shackled within their walled gardens.</p>

– <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Fediverse"><em>Wiktionary</em></a>, modified.</p>
