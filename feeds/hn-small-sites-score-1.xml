		<article>
				               
			<p>We are at a critical moment, when digital technologies of automation, often referred to with buzzy vocabulary like “algorithms” and “AI,” are poised to transform work in a “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Headlines scream about the imminent replacement of workers, often in language reminiscent of anti-immigrant rhetoric: robots are threatening to “take” or “steal” jobs. You can even go to the website willrobotstakemyjob.com and input specific occupations to get statistics on the likelihood of such theft. Writers have only a 3.8 percent chance—“totally safe”—while machinists face an alarming 65 percent. “Robots are watching,” the site cautions. These numbers are drawn from a widely cited 2013 report by economist Carl Benedikt Frey and computer scientist Michael A. Osborne that concluded 47 percent of total US employment would be automated by 2034.</p>
<p>Many writers on the radical left have accepted this framing of automation, while detourning its implications, making “full automation” central to the transcendence of capitalist exploitation. In <em>Inventing the Future</em>, Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek argue, “Without full automation, postcapitalist futures must necessarily choose between abundance at the expense of freedom (echoing the work-centricity of Soviet Russia) or freedom at the expense of abundance, represented by primitivist dystopias.” Aaron Bastani’s <em>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</em> pushes this idea to its limits, promising a future of boundless leisure for all, supplemented by a profusion of goods and services delivered sans human exploitation: “We will see more of the world than ever before, eat varieties of food we never have heard of, and lead lives equivalent—if we so wish—to those of today’s billionaires.”</p>
<p>Such a framing is both simple and attractive, especially to those of us trapped in dead-end jobs and eking out precarious existences; if robots, rather than we and our fellow workers, performed these tasks, and the productivity of technology were widely and equally dispersed, maybe we could spend our days doing more fulfilling activities than punching a clock. Like those cheesy banner ads that were all over the web in the late 2000s, you could have an egalitarian society with “one weird trick.” The bourgeoisie would hate this!</p>
<p>But Full Automators, whether dystopian or utopian, have a misguided approach to the question. According to historian Aaron Benanav, the specter of a postwork future has been conjured by anemic growth rates, not new technologies. Without radical change, our fate is further stagnation and crisis, not the world of the Jetsons. But new technologies certainly exist, and they are certainly doing, well, <em>something</em> to the work. But what?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a more basic question. What is automation? Machines have replicated and augmented human work processes for centuries, and that is often the colloquial use of “automation” in our current moment. But “automation” was not used to describe this process until 1947, when Delmar Harder, vice president of manufacturing at Ford Motor Company, created its Automation Department. The department’s engineers redesigned automobile production so that materials were automatically conveyed from one process to another, obviating the need for laborers to load and unload machines. Further, the process was itself increasingly machine-controlled, through a system of timers, switches, and relays—what technology historian David Hounsell calls the “electromechanical brain.”</p>
<p>Most of the technologies involved in automation had been developed and implemented in other industries years before their incorporation into Ford’s production process. What made automation new was its centrality to Ford’s manufacturing strategy, coming at a time of historic unrest among autoworkers, and in particular, on the heels of a costly twenty-four-day strike at Ford’s massive River Rouge plant in May of 1949. Not only would the new technologies dramatically reduce an unruly labor force, but they allowed Ford to decentralize its production away from the roiling unrest of Detroit as the company opened new automated factories, with new less militant employees, in Cleveland and Buffalo. Workers immediately perceived the threat, and automation was, from its inception, a deeply politicized issue. The history of automation reveals it as a political tool to subvert worker power, not simply an economic one to increase productivity.</p>
<p>Digging into the technical side of automation unearths more problems with the Full Automation Fallacy. David Autor, an economist, offers a useful corrective in his 2015 article “Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?,” its plaintive title a response to John Maynard Keynes’s Depression-era predictions of an automated future with a 15-hour work week. As Autor explains, rather than simply replace human jobs with machinic processes, automation affects labor in complex ways:</p>
<p>Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been “polarization” of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle.</p>
<p>Automation thus recomposes the workforce, isolating and rearranging tasks, altering job descriptions, and hollowing out middle-tier occupations.</p>
<p>Why does automation polarize instead of outright replace jobs? For one, many jobs require labor that is challenging to automate. Computers have to follow instructions laid out by programmers, so in order to substitute a computer for a worker, the worker’s tasks must be understood and articulated. However, much of the labor process is encompassed in tacit knowledge that workers are unable to articulate: “There are tasks for which neither computer programmers nor anyone else can enunciate the explicit ‘rules’ or procedures.” Even when tasks are known, automating them is easier said than done. On one end, computers cannot replicate the high levels of abstract thought required for managerial positions. On the other, jobs that require both manual work and flexibility, such as service sector jobs in food preparation and maintenance, are both difficult and cost-prohibitive to automate.</p>
<p>Take an example. In March 2018, Flippy, a burger-flipping robot, was rolled out at the Pasadena location of fast-food chain CaliBurger, to great fanfare and numerous headlines. The implication was clear: Would this humble machine spell the end of the fast-food job, the metonym for low-skilled entry-level occupations?</p>
<p>Not exactly. In an event that provoked far less press coverage, Flippy was retired after one day of work. CaliBurger’s owners took the honorable path of blaming Flippy’s failure on their human employees: workers, they explained, were simply too slow with tasks such as dressing the burgers, causing Flippy’s meaty achievements to pile up. However, a few discerning journalists had previously noted Flippy’s numerous errors in the relatively simple task that gave the robot its name. Flippy just wasn’t very good at its job. And so, yet another fully automated dream came crashing into messy reality.</p>
<p>According to Autor, the introduction of new kinds of information and control technology, such as what is currently hyped as “artificial intelligence,” supplements managerial work, and so increases the power and wages of bosses. On the other end, manual laborers (such as Flippy’s coworkers) see tasks eaten away and their movements reorganized and tightly controlled to make room for more rigid machines. Wages and working conditions deteriorate. But even then, automation stops short of “full”: such systems, as we will see, rely upon a stratum of human labor that is all but ineradicable. This is as true of Flippy as it is of the most powerful AI.</p>
<p>What do tend to be substitutable are not the lowest rungs, but those jobs requiring repetitive physical labor, as well as middle management jobs in operations. For example, Amazon’s warehouses use a software-directed system that coordinates human laborers, who select individual goods, with robots, who move large shelves. Algorithms replace middle-income jobs in managing the floor, leading to a polarized workforce of increasingly wealthy and powerful executives and programmers and increasingly degraded laborers who are substitutable not by machines, but by other humans; in other words, they are eminently replaceable.</p>
<p>But some have their targets set on precisely those positions in “knowledge work” that once promised a future safe from the robots. Technologists such as Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China, vow that white-collar jobs will go first. According to Lee, “The white collar jobs are easier to take because they’re purely a quantitative analytical process. Reporters, traders, telemarketing, telesales, customer service, analysts, they can all be replaced by software.”</p>
<p>But, of course, automation never completely erases human labor. Lee’s prediction of total replacement of knowledge work is a profound exaggeration, as a report by the think tank Data &amp; Society makes plain: “AI technologies reconfigure work practices rather than replace workers,” while at the same time, “automated and AI technologies tend to mask the human labor that allows them to be fully integrated into a social context while profoundly changing the conditions and quality of labor that is at stake.” Investigating grocery store self-checkout, researchers found that Luddite customers hated and avoided the technology. In response, management cut staff to make lines so unbearable that customers gave up and used the machines instead. Even then, cashiers were still required to assist and monitor transactions; rather than reduce workload, the technologies were “intensifying the work of customer service and creating new challenges.”</p>
<p>Self-checkout is an example of what technology journalist Brian Merchant calls “shitty automation”:</p>

            </section>

            
            <h2>And switching from init.vim to init.lua</h2>
            <p>If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language
with a passion, you’re in the right place! You can now get rid of
Vimscript wholesale and replace it with a simpler, faster and elegant-er
language — Lua! <em>However</em>, this is only possible from Neovim 0.5
onwards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and as of now, requires you to install Neovim from HEAD. How
to do that is left as an exercise to the reader. Also bear in mind that
the Lua API is fairly beta right now, and many Vim things don’t have
direct interfaces.</p>

<p>So assuming you’re now running Neovim <code>master</code>, head over to
<code>~/.config/nvim</code> and create your <code>init.lua</code>. Why, yes, we’re porting
over your <code>init.vim</code> to <code>init.lua</code> right now! Clear your calendar for
the next few hours — bikeshedding your text editor is top priority!</p>

<p>I also recommend going through
<a href="https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide" rel="nofollow">nanotee/nvim-lua-guide</a>
and <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/" rel="nofollow">Learn Lua in Y minutes</a>
before starting off.</p>

<h2>the directory structure</h2>

<p>Lua files are typically under <code>~/.config/nvim/lua</code>, and can be loaded as
Lua modules. This is incredibly powerful — you can structure your
configs however you like.</p>
<pre>$ tree .config/nvim
.
|-- ftplugin
|   `-- ...
|-- init.lua
|-- lua
|   |-- maps.lua
|   |-- settings.lua
|   |-- statusline.lua
|   `-- utils.lua
`-- plugin
    `-- ...
</pre>
<p>The common approach is to have different
bits of your config in Lua files under <code>lua/</code> and <code>require</code>’d in your
<code>init.lua</code>, so something like:</p>
<pre><span>-- init.lua</span>

require(<span>'</span><span>settings</span><span>'</span>)    <span>-- lua/settings.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>maps</span><span>'</span>)        <span>-- lua/maps.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>statusline</span><span>'</span>)  <span>-- lua/statusline.lua</span>
</pre>
<h2>the basics: setting options</h2>

<p>Vim has 3 kinds of options — global, buffer-local and window-local. In
Vimscript, you’d just <code>set</code> these. In Lua, however, you will have to
use one of</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_set_option()</code> — global options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option()</code> — buffer-local options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_win_set_option()</code> — window-local options</li>
</ul>

<p>These are fairly verbose and very clunky, but fortunately for us, we
have “meta-accesors” for these: <code>vim.{o,wo,bo}</code>. Here’s an excerpt from
my <code>settings.lua</code> as an example:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> o = vim.o
<span>local</span> wo = vim.wo
<span>local</span> bo = vim.bo

<span>-- global options</span>
o.swapfile = <span>true</span>
o.dir = <span>'</span><span>/tmp</span><span>'</span>
o.smartcase = <span>true</span>
o.laststatus = 2
o.hlsearch = <span>true</span>
o.incsearch = <span>true</span>
o.ignorecase = <span>true</span>
o.scrolloff = 12
<span>-- ... snip ... </span>

<span>-- window-local options</span>
wo.number = <span>false</span>
wo.wrap = <span>false</span>

<span>-- buffer-local options</span>
bo.expandtab = <span>true</span>
</pre>
<p>If you’re not sure if an option is global, buffer or window-local,
consult the Vim help! For example, <code>:h 'number'</code>:</p>
<pre>'number' 'nu'           boolean (default off)
                        local to window
</pre>
<p>Also note that you don’t set the negation of an option to true, like
<code>wo.nonumber = true</code>, you instead set <code>wo.number = false</code>.</p>

<h2>defining autocommands</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, autocommands in Vim don’t have a Lua interface — it is
being worked on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Until then, you will have to use
<code>vim.api.nvim_command()</code>, or the shorter <code>vim.cmd()</code>. I’ve defined a
simple function that takes a Lua table of <code>autocmd</code>s as an argument, and
creates an <code>augroup</code> for you.</p>
<pre><span>-- utils.lua</span>

<span>local</span> M = {}
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

<span>function</span> <span>M</span>.create_augroup(autocmds, name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup </span><span>'</span> .. name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd!</span><span>'</span>)
    <span>for</span> _, autocmd <span>in</span> ipairs(autocmds) <span>do</span>
        cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd </span><span>'</span> .. table.concat(autocmd, <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>))
    <span>end</span>
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup END</span><span>'</span>)
<span>end</span>

<span>return</span> M

<span>-- settings.lua</span>
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd
<span>local</span> u = require(<span>'</span><span>utils</span><span>'</span>)

u.create_augroup({
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>/tmp/nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>*s-nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
}, <span>'</span><span>ftmail</span><span>'</span>)

cmd(<span>'</span><span>au BufNewFile,BufRead * if &amp;ft == "" | set ft=text | endif</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>defining keymaps</h2>

<p>Keymaps can be set via <code>vim.api.nvim_set_keymap()</code>. It takes 4
arguments: the mode for which the mapping will take effect, the key
sequence, the command to execute and a table of options (<code>:h
:map-arguments</code>).</p>
<pre><span>-- maps.lua</span>

<span>local</span> map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap

<span>-- map the leader key</span>
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;Space&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>'</span>, {})
vim.g.mapleader = <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>  <span>-- 'vim.g' sets global variables</span>


options = { noremap = <span>true</span> }
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;esc&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:nohlsearch&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bnext&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;p</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bprev&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
</pre>
<p>For user defined commands, you’re going to have to go the <code>vim.cmd</code>
route:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wq wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wqa wqa</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! W w</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Q q</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>managing packages</h2>

<p>Naturally, you can’t use your favourite Vimscript package manager
anymore, or at least, not without <code>vim.api.nvim_exec</code>ing a bunch of
Vimscript (ew!). Thankfully, there are a few pure-Lua plugin managers
available to use<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> — I personally use, and recommend
<a href="https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim/" rel="nofollow">paq</a>. It’s light and makes use of
the <a href="https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/" rel="nofollow"><code>vim.loop</code></a> API for async I/O.
paq’s docs are plentiful, so I’ll skip talking about how to set it up.</p>

<h2>bonus: writing your own statusline</h2>

<p>Imagine using a bloated, third-party statusline, when you can just write
your own.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> It’s actually quite simple! Start by defining a table for
every mode:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

 <span>local</span> mode_map = {
	[<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>normal </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>n·operator pending </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>v</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>visual </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>V</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>s</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>select </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>S</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>i</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>insert </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>R</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>Rv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>c</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>command </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>cv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>vim ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>ce</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>prompt </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>rm</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>more </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r?</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>confirm </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>!</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>shell </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>t</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>terminal </span><span>'</span>
}
</pre>
<p>The idea is to get the current mode from <code>vim.api.nvim_get_mode()</code> and
map it to our desired text. Let’s wrap that around in a small <code>mode()</code>
function:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> mode()
	<span>local</span> m = vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode
	<span>if</span> mode_map[m] == <span>nil</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> m <span>end</span>
	<span>return</span> mode_map[m]
<span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, set up your highlights. Again, there isn’t any interface for
highlights yet, so whip out that <code>vim.api.nvim_exec()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.api.nvim_exec(
<span>[[
</span><span>  hi PrimaryBlock   ctermfg=06 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi SecondaryBlock ctermfg=08 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi Blanks   ctermfg=07 ctermbg=00
</span><span>]]</span>, <span>false</span>)
</pre>
<p>Create a new table to represent the entire statusline itself. You can
add any other functions you want (like one that returns the current git
branch, for instance). Read <code>:h 'statusline'</code> if you don’t understand
what’s going on here.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> stl = {
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  mode(),
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#Blanks#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%f</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%m</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%=</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%l,%c </span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%{&amp;filetype}</span><span>'</span>,
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, with the power of <code>table.concat()</code>, set your statusline. This
is akin to doing a series of string concatenations, but way faster.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.o.statusline = table.concat(stl)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://x.icyphox.sh/statusline.png" alt="statusline"></p>

<h2>this is what being tpope feels like</h2>

<p>You can now write that plugin you always wished for! I sat down to write
a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy" rel="nofollow">fzy</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, which you can
find <a href="https://git.icyphox.sh/dotfiles/tree/config/nvim/lua/fzy" rel="nofollow">here</a>
along with my entire Neovim config<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I plan to port a the last of my
<code>plugin/</code> directory over to Lua, soon™.</p>

<p>And it’s only going to get better when the Lua API is completed. We can
all be Vim plugin artists now.</p>

the traffic flows. For example, here's a reverse tunnel that allows only users from
IP address 1.2.3.4 access to port 80 on the SSH client through an SSH server.</p><p data-v-4fc16f31="">SSH tunnels are encrypted TCP connections between SSH clients and servers
that allows traffic entering one side of the tunnel to transparently exit
through the other. While the term originally referred to tunnels using TUN/TAP virtual
network interfaces, it's commonly used to refer to SSH port forwarding nowadays.
Use cases include:</p><ul data-v-4fc16f31=""><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Providing encrypted channels for protocols that use plaintext</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Opening backdoors into private networks</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Bypassing firewalls</li></ul><p data-v-4fc16f31="">This page is a work-in-progress.

remote services over an encrypted connection as if they were local services.
Example use cases:</p><ul data-v-47beec60=""><li data-v-47beec60="">Accessing a remote service (redis, memcached, etc.) listening on internal IPs</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Locally accessing resources available on a private network</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Transparently proxying a request to a remote service</li></ul></div><div data-v-47beec60=""><h4 data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding</h4><p data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding allows you to forward traffic on an SSH server

<p>Last week I spoke at the <a href="http://newpublic.org/">New_Public festival</a> in an “online park” where designers, urbanists, and artists explored how to create better “digital public spaces”. While preparing for the session I hosted, I started questioning how we came to understand our social media platforms as the “new public square” in the first place. The road to widespread internet adoption was paved with spatial metaphors, which helped non-technical people wrap their heads around this brand new technology. We drove down the information super<em>highway</em>, we visited cyber <em>space</em>, we navigated to web <em>sites</em>. Software designers were known as digital <em>architects</em> who built virtual places for work and play. We talked about the internet as if it was <em>outside</em> of us —&nbsp;an environment to wander around in, an ocean to surf.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/digital-sensorium/internet.gif"></p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/fIowerstructure">É. Urcades</a>, one of my favorite technologists on the interwebs, has challenged me to think differently about digital spaces. “websites”, he says, “are absolutely not places or architecture, they are temporary bodies … when you design interfaces you are -literally- designing the sensory organs people use to perceive information — interface design is organ design.” When our organs of perception get augmented by new technologies, we experience subtle shifts in our relationships with each other and with our selves. Throughout the 2010s, some <a href="https://qz.com/677218/this-woman-a-self-described-cyborg-can-sense-every-earthquake-in-real-time/">wannabe</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Harbisson">cyborgs</a> have already undergone extremely invasive procedures to augment their default “hardware”. But if É. Urcades is right, you don’t even need risky surgery to acquire new senses. You just have to turn on your (pocket) computer.</p>

<p>Thirty years into the digital age, it’s safe to say the internet isn’t just an <em>external</em> environment that we travel through or a “public space” that we stroll around in. It’s fully entangled with our nervous systems now, and it has re-shaped our minds in ways that aren’t always easy or comfortable to articulate. This process became even more apparent during 2020 —&nbsp;a year in which screens swallowed the last remaining bits of our “offline” culture and daily lives. I don’t think we’ll be able to create the sort of digital publics that the New_Public festival is aiming towards until we’ve adequately taken stock of what happens <em>within us</em> when we <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1340760227021533186?s=20">live</a> with the technologies we’ve built.</p>

<p>To that end, I wrote up 8 first-person stories about the new psychologies that have emerged under the influence of digital media. These accounts are based on a number of conversations with internet friends and strangers over the last few years. This is no doubt a small sampling of the subjective experiences that have been created by our software “sense organs.” What other unique sensory configurations are floating around out there, waiting to be discovered? Starting today, I’m opening up a digital <a href="https://j200lig809x.typeform.com/to/aKlUewsm">hotline</a> in order to find out. You can think of the stories below as the very first submissions to the hotline. Perhaps you’ll even recognize some of the experiences they describe as your own.</p>

<strong>subject: Exoskeletal unease</strong><br></p>

<p>You know that feeling when you outgrow your wardrobe? When you no longer feel like yourself in your old clothes? That happens to me with my virtual avatars and profile photos. Or maybe my accounts are more like <a href="https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1171603433301790720?s=20">exoskeletons</a> that I have to shed as I grow, and they absolutely need to be maintained because they’re as much “me” as anything else. My physical body no longer feels like the “center of gravity” of my identity… my sense of presence is forever <a href="https://hipcityreg.substack.com/p/the-concurrency-pool">fractured</a> and distributed all over the place. I close my eyes and imagine all the screens that are displaying my content at this very moment, I wonder about the total number of pixels I currently occupy, I feel like I am nowhere and also everywhere. After a while, the exoskeleton I wear online doesn’t really feel like a true expression of my inner self. It’s so much <a href="https://twitter.com/matildepark_/status/1258240760698286080?s=20">work</a> to keep it up to date, but I basically don’t have a choice because that’s where I do most of my socializing nowadays. To be honest, my internet friends are the only people who really understand what I’m about —&nbsp;everyone else is stuck with a shallow, incomplete version of me. As you can probably tell, I pour a lot of my self into these apps. When they die, like Vine did a few years ago, it feels almost like a psychological amputation. I’m permanently cut off from a part of my exoskeleton, and I have to grow a whole new shell.</p>

<p>So I started putting together a wiki of all my personal knowledge about 4 years ago, before Roam and Notion and Are.na were even a thing. I really wanted to be able to surf across my own mind the way other people surf across the web. My database is an always-growing <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1091506683036164096?s=20">network</a> of quotes, speculations, Bible verses, synchronistic hyperlinks, and interesting juxtapositions of information that I’ve collected from all over the place. Now that I’ve been building this wiki for a few years, my perception seems way more hyperlinked than it used to. Any random object or situation gives me like 400 flashbacks to books X, Y, Z and obscure historical references 1, 2, 3. I can’t look at a thing anymore and just see the thing. I filter all new info through the lens of my digitally extended mind and it feels like a superpower, or like that NZT-48 drug from the movie <em>Limitless</em>. Guess you could say I run my own little intelligence agency. Sometimes I even prefer video chat to IRL convos because I can easily reference my external brain without the other person noticing. If I ever lost access to my database, I’m not really sure <em>what</em> I’d do. I think the networked note-takers are really on the front lines of creating the Global Social Computer in the Cloud. Part of me suspects that someday, after I’m gone, someone will be able to use all my data to bring me back to life in deepfake form, like they <a href="https://adage.com/article/advertising/parkland-victim-joaquin-oliver-comes-back-life-heartbreaking-plea-voters/2285166">did to that kid</a> who died in the Parkland shootings. It gives me peace of mind to think that maybe, just maybe, my digital soul will survive into the far future —&nbsp;long after my meatspace body has decomposed.</p>

<p>Twitter has definitely changed my relationship with my internal monologue. Just like my vocal cords and larynx turn my silent neural activity into vibrating air molecules, my <em>external</em> voice box on twitter dot com turns my inner rumination into text on someone else’s screen. Before I started posting, my thoughts were more abstract and non-verbal —&nbsp;like blobs of play-doh floating around a zero gravity chamber. I used to spend a lot of time re-molding these amorphous thought forms into Twitter-friendly nuggets. But nowadays my internal monologue speaks tweet by default. Thoughts bubble up from the depths of my psyche readymade for the timeline, already twisted into the pre-programmed shape of a Post. I wonder if the algorithm is starting to interfere with the way my subconscious works. What if it’s filtering out thoughts that it doesn’t think will perform well online? Every day, thousands of strangers upload little slices of their consciousness directly into my mind. My <a href="https://reallifemag.com/podcast-passivity/">concern</a> is that I’m prone to mistake their thoughts for my own — that some part of me believes I’m only hearing myself think. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I’ll scroll through my old posts just to remind myself of myself. It feels like looking in the mirror. I’m swallowing my (digital) self so that I’m <em>me</em> instead of someone else.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I basically spent all my childhood building worlds in SimCity and Rollercoaster Tycoon and zooming into random cities on <a href="https://reallifemag.com/springtime-everywhere/">Google Earth</a>. These apps definitely inspired my decision to work in urban planning. This might sound weird, but when I walk through a building I can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1260366804184117248?s=20" title="">tell you</a> what version of AutoCad they used to design it. After spending years and years in rendering software, you sort of get a sixth sense for the tools &amp; features that the architect had access to, and the IRL built environment starts to feel kinda fake — like the different “towns” inside Disney World. On top of that, the POV of the virtual camera follows me out into the “real world.” I’m pretty good at hallucinating what my surroundings would look like from the drone’s eye view. (The other day, one of my friends was telling me that he can convince himself he’s playing The Sims or a first-person shooter game with his own body, monitoring the little green bars, making sure his stats are all good). When I look at the gradient of a beautiful sunset, or the hairline cracks in a concrete sidewalk, or the murky texture of a cumulonimbus cloud, I can’t help but think about how hard it’d be to make something like that in Unity. It’s almost like the world is a big game engine and God is the supernatural renderer. Maybe one of these days I’ll turn around too quickly and spot a glitch. Sometimes I mix up my IRL memories with memories from my VR experiences, but that’s a whole other story…</p>

<p>I’ve been on TikTok a lot lately, and it’s kind of changed the way I see and hear things. When I’m scrolling the For You page, I’m not really taking in each video as a whole —&nbsp;I’m always deconstructing it in my mind. I process the audio separately from the visuals and try to figure out how I might re-use the sound for my own content ideas. The weird thing is that this “Song Exploder” mode of hearing has seeped into my everyday life. When I’m out and about, I’m constantly sensing my auditory environment through the TikTok filter in my head. When I’m hanging out with friends who spend a lot of time on the app, we can basically speak a whole different language together. We’ve memorized enough videos that we can have a whole ass conversation using only obscure quotes and …</p></section></div></div>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>New Year’s Eve morning, I decided to start the new year with Roam. </p>



<p>A few days ago, I noticed, I passed the threshold of 5,000 notes in Evernote. The last two years, my daily-not-so-daily Logs are missing a piece of organization, that I might find in Roam. That’s how Travis Daily started his post on <a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">how to migrate from Evernote to Roam</a> “I have 5000 plus notes in my Evernote account”. </p>







<h2 id="0-roam-sources">Roam Sources</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">Migrate From Evernote To Roam Research With Notion</a> by Travis Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.roamtips.com/">Roam Tips by </a>Mark Traphagen (<a href="https://twitter.com/marktraphagen">@marktraphagen</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love It and How I Use It</a> by <strong>Nat Eliason</strong> – one of my long reads of this week. </li></ul>



<p>The first time,  I heard about Roam was on the<a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/104"> 104th episode of the React podcast by Chantastic</a>. <a href="https://jevakallio.dev/">Jani Eväkallio</a> talked  about Roam and about his app called <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a>, that allows you to transform your VSCode instance to a Roam app. The ideas on Roam are all based on <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/">Tiago Forte’s work</a> and <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Build a Second Brain</a> approach. There is actually a <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-second-brain-manifesto/">“Second Brain Manifesto”</a></p>



<p><strong>Roam Research </strong>doesn’t have an API yet for further integration with other tools but there is a <a href="https://github.com/artpi/roam-research-private-api">‘Private API’</a> by <a href="https://piszek.com/">Artur Piszek</a> from Warsaw,  working at Automattic. Artur also created the <a href="https://deliber.at/wp-roam-block/">Roam Block plugin</a>, I have yet to test. </p>



<h2 id="1-strong-import-all-evernote-items-to-notion-strong">Import all Evernote items to Notion</h2>



<p>I already have a Notion account I started and then never used from 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="238" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-31-at-11.34.36-AM.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Turns out my notes numbers (over 5,000) are inflated. In 2012, in a misguided attempt to preserve Twitter Favorites, I sync them with Evernote via IFTTT, to never looked at them again. I let it run between  Dec 14, 2012 to April 29, 2015, and I accumulated 2112 single notes. Those won’t come over to RoamResearch. Since then, I archive Tweets, favorites aka likes and follows on Google Sheet.  </p>



<p>I felt great relief when Notion’s import script showed me the breakdown of notes in notebooks,  so I can select the ones I would want to import.  The breakdown also reveals some abandoned attempts to organize my notes. </p>



<p>It takes more than a couple of minutes, I guess. 30 minutes into the import time, I could only see notes back to 2018. It seems, the connection only imported about 550 of the 2872 notes and then stopped. I tried to start it again, and it counted through the imported once rather quickly so there seems to be a duplicate check. I am happy about that. I read through the documentation on Evernote import, and it didn’t mention any rate limits. </p>



<p>I started a chat through the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004">Help and Support pages at Notion</a>. I connected with two people. <em>“This is definitely not intended behavior and has been filed with our engineering team. Unfortunately, we may not have a fix right away, but know it’s on our to-do list.</em>” Meanwhile, I’ll follow this advice: <em>“Sometimes it’s caused by a single (usually large) page. If you are importing multiple notebooks, would you mind trying to import your notes in smaller batches? If there are lots of photos, videos, etc. I’d try importing those a few at a time, but if they’re just text you can import them in larger batches :)”</em></p>



<p>Moving in Evernote only works with 50 Notes at a time. God, my grandmother was right. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Computers are a colossal waste of time! </p><cite>Oma Pauli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I copy/pasted today’s#1023 note over to Roam to get acquainted with the future interface. I might as well go on our lunch run. </p>



<p>15 days in I am still in love with Roam and now really need to continue the work to migration Evernote content to Roam Research. </p>



<h2 id="2-from-notion-to-roam-research">From Notion to RoamResearch</h2>



<p>So now that many notes have been imported to Notion, I exported them as instructed. The import into RoamResearch works, but it’s only 10 files at a time. 🤦‍♀️</p>



<p>I also expected that <em>RoamResearch</em> would be able to read the created date and import it accordingly. Now all have today’s date. I had to change every note’s name to turn it into a Daily Note. For that purpose, a 10 file limit is probably good. </p>



<h2 id="3-private-api">Private-api</h2>



<p>I had hoped that Artur Priszek’s private-api would get me started, but it doesn’t have much documentation beyond the read me and the roam-quick command, I could get working. I need to dive into code, to figure out how it would work beyond. I can see myself creating a little CLI app that hides away the access credentials and lets me write via the command line something like <code>rem 'Call your mother tomorrow' </code>and have it show up in the Quick Capture of the app, when I switch over to the app again.  </p>



<h2 id="4-what-i-like-about-using-roam-research">What I Like about using Roam Research</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Command + K works</strong> for adding link to highlighted text. It also uses pure Markdown [link text](linkurl) and converts it to links once you leave the editing mode. </li><li><strong>Adding a tag is as easy </strong>as adding a # before the work. </li><li><strong>Can import JSON + Markdown.</strong> </li><li><strong>Slash command</strong> and first item on the list is the TODO item once I hit enter my checkbox are back.</li><li>The <strong>Sidebar</strong> shows me all Todos in one screen as well as the “Done” items. </li><li>The <strong>auto-creation of daily pages</strong> is neat and a time saver. I started adding future dates to do items or preparation for meetings etc. very helpful. In the morning, I open the RoamResearch app and see what my past self has in store for me. </li><li>Easy page merge: So with any other notes app, that has a tagging feature, I would never get the spelling right for hashtags and other tags and end up with too many tags that are misspellings, and they are a pain to consolidate, so I never did. With RoamResearch, when I discover I two similar tags, I decide on a single one and just change the page title of the other one, and it merge the two page. Brilliant. </li><li>The biggest tools especially after I import the Evernote notes will be the <strong>‘Unlinked references’</strong> it finds for a certain topic. It unloads the cognitive loads, you have to put into document management, for when you forget the coding of certain things. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Definitely an <strong>API to integrate with other services</strong>. </li><li><strong>Faster load on mobile.</strong> It’s spins for multiple seconds until I can start adding text, and sometimes I can’t get it to sync from other devices. </li><li>Seems at publishing date, the right sidebar is broken. It’s just shows an empty column. </li></ul>

<p>After a month of using it, I am definitely comfortable, sometimes still lost. February will be the month going from Novice to competent user on the Dreyfus’ “Five-Stage Model of Mental Activities Involved in Directed  Skill Acquisition”. I just read it. Speaking of Reddit, there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/">RoamResearch community</a> and in a pinned post, are some thoughts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/">how to work on projects</a>. That’s my next adventure. </p>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Over the last few months, I’ve been working on solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe">Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</a>, also known as (Tic Tac Toe)². I’ve made considerable progress, but, as of this writing, am still some distance away from the solution being feasible in an amount of compute time and money I’m willing to spend. This section of the site is dedicated to documenting my work so far and some next steps.</p><p>Solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe isn’t a particularly important goal in and of itself, but I’ve found this project a great opportunity to learn about a fairly wide range of topics; I’m hopeful this writeup can bring some of those lessons to others who have similar interests, or just who want to follow along with a nerdy deep-dive into game tree search and high-performance Rust while we’re all stuck at home.</p><p>As of this writing, I have a high-performance Ultimate Tic Tac Toe solver written in Rust. This solver includes:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/efficient-representation/">high performance implementation</a> of an Ultimate Tic Tac Toe engine.</li><li>An <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/">efficient parallel proof tree search algorithm</a>, consisting of a combined two-level <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">Proof Number search</a> and <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/dfpn/">Depth-First Proof Number Search</a> search.</li><li>A <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/tt/">high-performance parallel transposition table</a>.</li><li>An <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pruning/">positional analysis engine</a> capable of solving some positions and moves without tree search, in order to prune the search tree.</li></ul><p>The solver is presently capable of solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe positions after about 20 ply (10 moves by each player) in a few hours of search on my Ryzen 3900X desktop. I (very roughly) estimate this implies a total computational cost of a few hundred million CPU-hours to solve the whole game without further optimization. CPU time on AWS costs something like 2 cents an hour, suggesting a cost in the $2M - $10M range. I thus believe the solution is solidly within the realm of “technically feasible”, but certainly well outside my budget. Further optimizations will be required to knock off a few more orders of magnitude in order to complete the project.</p><ul><li>You can find <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/ultimattt">the code</a> on Github. I’ve also tried to include links to relevant files throughout this site.</li><li>If you’re unfamiliar with the game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, start with <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/the-game">my writeup</a> of the game.</li><li>The core of my solver is based on the <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">Proof-Number search</a> family of algorithms. You can <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">read my background information about that family</a>, or jump to <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/">the writeup of my search algorithm</a>.</li><li>If you’re curious about my efficient implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, including what I suspect of being the first-ever SIMD Tic Tac Toe implementation, <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/efficient-representation/">find that here</a>.</li></ul></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor/status/1357028887209902088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">The other day on Twitter</a></p><blockquote>Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:<p>Input: "aaaabbbcca"</p><p>Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)] Write a function that converts the input to the output I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes How would you solve it?</p></blockquote><p>I thought about it for a few minutes while I was doing other things, came up with the answer, congratulated myself (yay me!) and went on to other things.</p><p>Then it was posted on a tech forum. How would you answer the question? Lots of folks weighed in, all with seemingly (to me) long-winded coding solutions. Surely they didn't realize the genius of &nbsp;my solution in F#! So I posted it.</p><blockquote>In F#, t looks to me like “aaaabbbcca” |&gt; Seq.countBy id;;<br>I don’t know how to make it any simpler than that.</blockquote><p>Once again, I congratulated myself (yay me!) and moved on. Later that day, I logged on again and a commenter was nice enough to give me my comeuppance.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, this doesn’t return the expected output. That last “a” is what throws a wrench in solutions like this.</blockquote><p>Looking back at that tweet, holy shit! I missed that second "a"! Well hell, this is a completely different kind of problem than I first thought. I'll just copy the input string from the website and bang something out in order to save my honor. A wrong must be righted.</p><p>I spent the next hour or two staring at the code and wondering what the hell is going on. Twenty lines of code and it doesn't compile. Gives me something like:</p><blockquote>error FS0010: Unexpected character '“' in interaction</blockquote><p>Did I cast something the wrong way? I tried recasting things. Did I hose up my environment? I reloaded. Is my code structure off in subtle ways? Nothing I did seemed to work. Finally, out of desperation, I started a new project and re-typed everything in by hand.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>The problem? When I copied and pasted the input code, it was using typographic quotes, not programming quotes. It was a copy-and-paste problem, of the freaking input data, that had defeated me all of that time.</p><p>Once that was out of the way, I kicked out the solution rather quickly, first coding it up as a strongly-typed function and then removing the type restrictions to make it one day a generic library function. As another commenter pointed out, this is classic Run Length Encoding, so that's what I named the function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
let runLengthEncode&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc =
    if inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty then acc else
    let itemWereWatching=inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head
    let chunk=inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile itemWereWatching.Equals
    let chunkLength=chunk|&gt;Seq.length
    let newInputSeq = inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip chunkLength
    let newItem=seq{itemWereWatching, chunkLength}
    rleInnerLoop newInputSeq newItem |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The only type constraint I had was that whatever stream of stuff I'm processing, it has to support equality, or a=b, otherwise how could I remove duplicates? I'm also quite taken back by the size of the code. Now my code was the big honking solution. Yikes!</p><p>Could I shorten it? Well sure, since it's pure FP and written in an idiomatic style, the whole thing could collapse to one line of code. But why do that? All of those labels in there are for my benefit, in case I need to debug. Until I've tested the hell out of it, I need the labels. (Plus the labels and size shouldn't matter to the compiler anyway, if I can collapse it, the compiler should be able to collapse it)</p><p>But something about this feels odd to me, as if it were one of those situations where non-idiomatic code might be better for performance reasons. That's what happens under-the-hood with some F# library functions. For now, though, I'll let the library guys worry about optimization and I'm stay happy with a solved problem. yay me</p><p>Of course I have to write the inverse function, Run Length Decode:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthDecode (inputSeq:seq&lt;'a*int&gt;) =
  seq {yield! inputSeq|&gt;Seq.collect(fun x-&gt;Seq.replicate (snd x) (fst x))}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's a lot shorter and makes me happy. When I see functions like the first one I worry that I've gone far afield of the best solution, perhaps by reinventing the wheel. When I see functions like the second one, I am reassured that this is a common problem. Many others have been here before me. (This goes back to my statement that "I need the labels until I've tested the hell out of it" Other people have done the testing work. Woot!)</p><p>What lessons were learned? Well, I really suck at coding in my head. I knew already but continue to be amazed when it happens with only the simplest problems. One of the major points of <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">Info-Ops II</a> is that our belief in our understanding of the code, no matter what it is, is much more unfounded than founded. Even with "perfect" code, battle-tested and hardened, the most you can say is that it works, it has no bugs, and you can trust it. You can't say you understand all that's going on. Modern programming if far, far too complex for that ever to be true. </p><p>We're all like that, even non-coders. As much as some of us think we can code in our head, it doesn't work that way, even many times with the most trivial of problems. That doesn't stop us, though. There are people who think they can talk at length about deep issues like foreign policy, all the while maintaining a logical and coherent set of symbols. They're being logical. They're running the code they've created in their head. Other folks, though, are not. (Other folks see this the same way, only with the players reversed) </p><p>This is true in policy discussion for the exact same reasons it's true with coding. There's simply too much depth and nuance in language for it to work like code, and even if it did work like code, we'd think we understood far, far more than we actually do. We lose either way.</p><p>Secondly, test cases don't always save you. Yes, my initial mistake was not having test cases, just doing it in my head, but once I had test cases and started coding it out, the major part of my hang-up was dealing with some kind of IDE/OS/Unicode/UTF-8 crap, not the code itself. Doesn't matter, I still would have taken more than the allotted 25 minutes. I do not get the job.</p><p>But I had fun. That made it worth the effort.</p><p>P.S. For those interested in how this all would collapse into one line, here's a hint:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthEncode2&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc = match inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty with |true-&gt;acc|false-&gt;rleInnerLoop (inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)) (seq{(inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head), ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)}) |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>

When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Competition among businesses is obviously vital to a functioning market. A business that doesn’t have to compete doesn’t have to offer <em>competitive</em> products, pay, etc. Competition on one hand and regulation on the other form an opposing pair of constraints that channels a business’s pursuit of growth, dominance, profit, and development into benefit for society. I posit that the typical root cause of so-called greedy business practices (such as poverty wages, price gouging, lay-offs, cutting costs via human and animal cruelty, environmental pollution, and so on) is not a moral failing of the chief decision-makers, but rather inadequate regulation.</p><p>Yesterday my wife said to me “Kroger is offering to pay $100 to each employee who gets the COVID vaccine. Funny how they’ll do that, but they won’t give hazard pay for working during the pandemic!”.</p><p>“Well, hazard pay would be a lot more expensive, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes — $4 per hour in Seattle.” So after one week, this would exceed the one-time $100 bonus for full-time employees. “I know it would be costly, but the work is dangerous right now. The employees deserve it.”</p><p>“I agree,” I said, “but to control costs a company can’t pay a whole lot more than the market rate for whatever type of labour it needs. Outspending the competition for the same thing is bad for business.”.</p><p>“I don’t really care what’s bad for business. Paying workers fairly is the right thing to do. The greed required to put profit before ethics is disgusting.”</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-business">what’s bad for business</h2><p>So, why don’t businesses generally “do the right thing” even if it’s costly? So what if the competition outcompetes them? Winning isn’t everything, right? Sure, but losing <em>is</em> everything. In a stable market, there’s a kind of competitive equilibrium. An uncompetitive company risks being driven out of the market by competitive companies.</p><p>Couldn’t a company just take some money out of profits to pay better, to make more environmentally friendly choices, or whatever? Well, profit makes a company an attractive investment. A company competes not only for customers, but for investors, too. If one company becomes a less attractive investment than its competitors, investors reallocate their investments for better performance. Sacrificing for the greater good <em>is a sacrifice</em>, and the cost is market share.</p><p>Okay, so why don’t businesses make the sacrifice — give up market share or possibly go out of business — in the service of ethics? Because less market share means less power to do the right thing. Companies that have made such sacrifices don’t dominate the market. “Unethical” companies do. One might be able to do the right thing for a little while, but one’s contribution to society will be short-lived.</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-consumers-and-workers">what’s bad for consumers and workers</h2><p>Some say consumers should vote with their wallets. It feels good to support small local businesses, to boycott sweatshops, to put your money where your morals are. Unfortunately it’s more costly. What Walmart lacks in charm and scruples it makes up for in discounts.</p><p>Other than wealthy consumers who can afford the luxury of consistent ethical choices in the market, the rest of the consumers are in a bind. It’s a matter of preservation of quality of life (or in the extreme, self-preservation) to seek the best deal we can get. The principal form of competition among consumers is not so much “keeping up with the Joneses” as it is making our dollar go as far as everyone else’s. For each ethical spending decision we make, we have less money overall to work with than someone with a similar income who makes the most economically rational choice. So are we going to pay extra for cruelty-free eggs or for cruelty-free clothes? We can’t do this for everything all at once. If <em>all</em> of our purchases are the ethical option, we can’t afford some things that others can afford. Something has to give, and because we are competing with other wage-earners, the result is downward class mobility, a slow spiral into poverty.</p><h2 id="if-not-individual-choices-then-what">If not individual choices, then what?</h2><p>So businesses and consumers both are in a bind where competition dictates that they make economically rational choices or lose. Efficiency is maximised at great environmental and social cost. Individual choices mean squat because “the invisible hand” of the market punishes certain ethical choices and eventually diminishes the influence of ethical agents such that their agency has little effect.</p><p>But what if everyone did the right thing? A market full of agents voluntarily choosing the right thing is wide open for someone to take advantage.</p><p>Okay, but what if everyone <em>had to do the right thing</em>? Consider the minimum wage. Apart from a few egregious loopholes, businesses in most industries have to abide by it. Does Kroger suffer a competitive loss by paying its employees the minimum wage? No, because all of the other grocers have to do likewise. Something still has to give, but it’s not a consumer’s standard of living or a business’s market share. The money really can come out of profits in this case. If it’s coming out of all grocers' profits, investors can’t very well get out of paying for it by divesting from one grocer (or one industry) to invest in another. Almost the whole economy is equally affected, so investors don’t have much of an alternative to taking the loss and moving on. When everyone is forced to make an ethical choice, competitive standing is no longer at stake in making it.</p><h2 id="the-economy-as-a-game">the economy as a game</h2><p>Imagine a sport very much like football (not American hand-egg) wherein there is no such thing as a foul. It would be a perfectly valid (if unethical) strategy to injure the other team relentlessly until they were unable to mount a competent opposition, and then to score goals unchallenged for the remaining time. (Trust me - as a kid, I tested this strategy in Fifa 98 with fouls turned off.)</p><p>Well, perhaps not unethical if you consider that the risk would be obvious and participation voluntary. Participation in the market is hardly voluntary (apologies to any hunter-gatherers I may offend), though the risks are obvious.</p><p>So how do we achieve the utilitarian outcome of minimising the risk of injury in our sport, given that everyone is entered into this tournament at birth? We could just try to play ethically on an individual basis, or try to shift the general attitudes of many players against violence. But the people who kick shins will end up playing the most matches in this tournament, because their strategy still works. We choose to lose by abstaining from exploitation individually, so we choose to allow the shin-kickers to dominate. We’re in a bind. The “ethical” choice does not fix the systemic problem that causes the bad outcome. With this set of rules, either choice leads to the same bad outcome. Well, obviously we need to reinstate the foul rule! If it’s impossible to win by kicking shins, there ceases to be any competitive advantage in doing so, and we can all benefit from a game with less shin-kicking.</p><p>Choosing ethically in commerce may assuage our guilt, but it does not make the world a better place. Regulations would actually make a difference.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Mediocre Programmer? What's that?</p>
<p>The Mediocre Programmer is a book about the journey of becoming a better programmer. But before we can become better programmers we have to pass through being mediocre programmers. Mediocre doesn't mean a bad programmer --- far from it. It means lacking skill. As beginners we start our journey full of fresh ideas of how we'll be great programmers, but as we learn more we realize that the gap between being a beginner and an expert programmer requires us to be mediocre for a time. And that period of mediocrity can be frustrating. As beginning programmers we're given all the encouragement to explore and make mistakes. As we move to the intermediate and mediocre stages of programming that encouragement fades. Instead of encouragement we are faced with expectations, both from ourselves and from others. We start to question our abilities. Why do we have to keep looking things up? Shouldn't we already know this? Why does programming feel like a struggle? Am I ever going to be good at this? </p>
<p>This book is about helping you along on the journey of being a mediocre programmer. Together we'll uncover some of common misconceptions we have about programming, failure, and growth and come to understand that the act of programming and development is something we undertake each day and improve in small ways. It's these small changes that over time transform us from being mediocre programmers into better programmers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books on how to become a better programmer out there. Books like this tend to have checklists and other advice that the author deems important enough for you to do in order to become a better programmer. They tend to focus on specific improvements like choosing a better editor, writing better test cases, or drinking lots of water. Those books have lots of useful advice, but they read like a laundry list of things that you must do all at once in order to succeed. This book will try not to saddle you with more work (you likely have enough as it is). Rather, we'll discuss what it feels like to be a programmer. We'll talk about the emotions in being a programmer; the feelings of frustration, guilt, anger, and inadequacy. We'll cover the struggles in learning new things and keeping your skills current. We'll talk about those times when you feel like giving up and walking away from computing and whether those feelings come from a place of love or a worry that you're not keeping up.</p>
<p>This book is a personal journey for both of us. It's a memoir of my time as a programmer and my feelings along the way. I've thought many times about giving up and finding a different career path but doing anything other than being a computer programmer scares me even more. Does that mean I'm stuck in a perverse ouroboros of self-pity and self-doubt? Hardly. It means that I need to dig deeper to understand why I chose the path of being a programmer and realize that it took a lot to get here and it's going to take a lot more to get where I want to be. It's a commitment to seeing things as they are now and moving forward from wherever I'm standing.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Day One - Exiting the Pyramid</strong></p><p>On December 17, I stopped eating for seven days. I consumed nothing but water, coffee, and an occasional pinch of salt. I did it to achieve cellular regeneration, spiritual contemplation, and a temporary break in my furious, constant consumption of every calorie within ten feet.</p><p>I was following in the footsteps of a man who tried to starve himself to death. In 1887, Dr. Henry S. Tanner stopped eating, having apparently decided that he deserved an agonizing demise after failures in marriage and business. As the first few famished days passed, he wondered when the sweet release of death would cease its tardiness. But, by the tenth day, he didn’t feel hungry anymore—in fact, felt vigorous and healthy. He saw no reason to stop fasting, and, in the end, fasted for a month, before repeating the feat repeatedly in the presence of puzzled doctors.</p><p>However, though Dr. Tanner did much to popularize fasting in the modern era, he wasn’t my immediate inspiration. I’d been influenced to try water fasting by friends in the tech sector, where fasting has become something of a trend. Not everyone is happy about this. The Harper’s Bazaar article “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/a28577713/silicon-valley-fasting/">Inside Silicon Valley’s Dangerous New Obsession with Fasting</a>,” for example, claims that fasting is merely disordered eating rebranded and that its tech sector purveyors are being unjustly lauded for habits that are condemned in teen girls. There’s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/extreme-fasting-how-silicon-valley-is-rebranding-eating-disorders">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/01/silicon-valley-extreme-diets-fasting/581566/">this one</a>, and many other works of literature penned by the nutrition and psychology experts of progressive Twitter.</p><p>They’re all mostly wrong. They’re also probably somewhat culturally motivated; it’s hard to imagine any of these publications putting out something called The Dark Side of Ramadan: Inside the Muslim World’s Dangerous Obsession with Fasting.</p><p>But I don’t blame them for being wrong. Their opinions are to be expected. They’ve been educated by a culture that teaches you the gospel of three meals a day, every day—that constant eating is a necessity for happiness. From birth, they’ve been pumped full of propaganda prepared by agribusiness and government, including conceptual ideas like the Food Pyramid, that compellingly geometric menu that has dug many an early grave. If I told them, or, really, most anyone off the street that I wasn’t going to eat for seven days, they’d probably wonder if I were committing suicide.</p><p>But fasting for surprisingly long periods of time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314618/">doesn't actually seem dangerous</a>, for most. In a sense, this finding is obvious; if human beings weren’t able to use our fat stores to survive, we wouldn’t have made it out of the ancestral environment, where occasional scarcity was simply a given.</p><p>However, fasting <em>is</em> hazardous, in a way. It punches this weird food-shaped hole in consensus reality. Doing it can change the way you think about, at the very least, food, disease, and the progress of science—which is to say, a big chunk of human life.</p><p>Oh, and, at times, it does totally suck. The first day is tricky. Your body is trained by your normal habits, developing hunger pangs in response to the release of a hormone called ghrelin. When you just skip all of that day’s meals, the ghrelin assault is uncomfortable. But then you sit through it, and your hunger pangs just… go away, leaving you, mysteriously, alive.</p><p><strong>Day Two - Big Nothing</strong></p><p>Sometimes, I wish there were a Big Nothing lobby—some sort of agency devoted to studying what would happen if we did less. For example, let’s say the government became fixated on some problem with social welfare. Is there anyone to study what would happen if we did nothing? Would it just get better on its own? Similarly, what would happen if, in response to population-level health issues, instead of taking supplements or treatments, we just ate nothing for an interval?</p><p>Unfortunately, profit motives rule out this potential world. There is no Nothing Lobby. Which is a shame, because if Pfizer or Merck stumbled upon a drug that could do half of what fasting appears to, their entire R&amp;D apartments would be frothing at the mouth and gripping their calipers tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it’s touted as a weight loss intervention, fasting’s health effects go way beyond that. When you read the fasting literature, you have all these moments of, like, <em>what, really? </em>For example, if you come down with cancer, you might want to fast, because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048045/">fasting appears to protect the body during chemotherapy, allowing higher doses of radiation to be administered with fewer side effects.</a> On the other hand, maybe you should’ve fasted earlier: studies in mice suggest that fasting <a href="https://osher.ucsf.edu/patient-care/integrative-medicine-resources/cancer-and-nutrition/faq/cancer-and-fasting-calorie-restriction">might be effective in slowing or preventing tumor growth</a>. If you’re just not interested in getting sick at all, you should know that <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(14)00151-9">fasting appears to promote the generation of new white blood cells, thus potentially reinvigorating the immune system</a>. It could also keep you sharp, and by that I mean keep you sharp when you’re 80 years old. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/">Fasting appears to promote neuronal health, potentially making it a defense against neurodegenerative diseases</a>.</p><p>But, if weight loss is what you’re looking for, supervised fasting appears to be strikingly effective. For example, in 1965, a 456lb man named Angus Barbieri went without eating for a year with no apparent negative consequences, went down to around 180, and kept the weight off for his whole life. And, while this result is uncommon in degree, a brief peak at <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fasting">reddit.com/r/fasting</a> reveals that it’s not unusual in kind.</p><p>We maybe understand why this happens. It seems to be down to autophagy—literally, self-ingestion. Your body constantly recycles old material, but, when you’re fasting, that process is dramatically accelerated. Old cells are broken down. Excess fat is turned into ketone bodies so the brain can continue operating. (Many who lose weight during fasting are surprised to find that they don’t have loose skin because their bodies literally ate it.) After all of the old stuff is recycled, the hypothesis goes, your body functions better.</p><p>But, overall, we’re still ignorant of the mechanisms of water fasting, despite the fact that it’s been advocated for thousands of years—Pythagoras required it of his students, finding that it promoted lucidity and focus. We don’t know what the ideal fasting protocol is. We don’t exactly understand its effects on longevity. It’s possible that repeat fasts in a short period of time could be damaging, specifically to the kidneys—where exactly are the healthy limits? We don’t know.</p><p>Several luminaries of the fasting scene, which is a thing that exists, have figured out how to make money off Nothing. One prominent advocate of no food, Dr. Jason Fung, sells highly readable books on fasting and helps run <a href="http://thefastingmethod.com/">a clinic</a> that coaches people through the fasting lifestyle. Another, Dr. Valter Longo, also sells books, as well as <a href="https://prolonfast.com/">ready-made meals</a> which are low-calorie enough to help fasters maintain a fasting state, but nutritive enough to make the process more tolerable.</p><p>This is all great, but, for the time being, the Nothing Lobby will be eclipsed by the mountains of cash involved in soybean oil, corn syrup, dietary supplements, and bariatric surgeries. And so, for the foreseeable future, fasting may remain poorly-explained and under-promoted, a personal rebellion against the entrenched interests undermining our health.</p><p>Perhaps this should make us furious. I know a fair number of fat people who want to lose weight. They’re given diets that don’t work, supplements that don’t work, and then shamed, which also doesn’t work. But, as it turns out, they might not need any of that. With medical supervision, they could probably solve the problem by not eating for a month or two. It could be a really shitty month or two—but better than struggling for decades, if losing weight is what you want to do. But if they read Harper’s Bazaar, or other maintainers of the dietary Overton Window, they might be dissuaded from even investigating this possibility.</p><p>On day two, fasting is doing weird things to me. Usually, I’m hot all over, but, without calories, my extremities go through thermal alternation—my nose is cold, then hot again. My breath smells great, then awful. At random moments, I’m seized by waves of incredible energy, thoughts of conquest, and the lust for food. At other moments, I lust for nothing and dwell in profound neutrality. I’m more diurnal; whereas I normally tend towards nocturnal activity, I wake with the sun, and my energy plunges the moment it’s dark.</p><p><strong>Day Three - First Principles</strong></p><p>Perhaps one reason that fasting has become popular in Silicon Valley is that it’s an applied crash course in First Principles Thinking. This term has only become a tired cliche in tech circles because it’s a principle that’s served so effectively in the past. The best (and worst) technological innovations have come from asking questions so basic only a curious child or a frenzied entrepreneur would think to ask them, and the process continues today. We don’t live on Mars. Why? We have to drive our cars. Why? We should eat a shit-ton of food every day, without interruption. Why?</p><p>The reason is not immediately apparent. On the third day of my fast, I wake up feeling fine, if still not totally normal. There is this basic knowledge that my bowels are empty. My interior feels strikingly vacant. But, generally, my physical condition is less notable than it was the day before.</p><p>What’s more notable is how surreal it all is. Our days are broken up by meals and punctuated by snacks. Once you take that away, what’s left?&nbsp;</p><p>Great expanses of time. The day just goes on and on and on. In that ocean of minutes, I’m unusually productive. Uninterrupted by the 100,000 snack breaks I usually take in a day, I double my usual daily writing output. Moreover, I’m weirdly focused. The energy that would usually go into digesting fistfuls of random stuff from the fridge is being directed into my laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a change in mood, too. Most emotion drops away, positive and negative. I’m not interested in listening to fun …</p></div></div>

Well, I spent the next year struggling to reconcile this view with my startup at the time, which was focused on building a passion economy solution for indie developers. And while I am very proud of everything I built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saasify.sh/">Saasify</a>, the platform itself hit some <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-vc-feedback">major roadblocks</a>. I had my founder blinders on (which can be both good and bad depending on the circumstances) and felt weighed down by the sunk costs I'd already put into bootstrapping Saasify.</p><p>I needed a change of pace. To reflect. To <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-key-takeaways">revisit my assumptions</a> and explore what got me excited about this space in the first place.</p><h3 data-id="9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2"><a href="#9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2" title="And that, folks, brings me to today"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>And that, folks, brings me to today</span></h3><p>The idea of moving towards a more independent <em>and</em> fulfilling future of work just aligns so well with my values that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.</p><p>I've spent the past few months voraciously researching, networking, and thinking about the passion economy. I think this is a very important step in the creative process for founders to develop their own deep, holistic understanding of a space before diving into building products and solutions (a mistake I've fallen prey to in the past).</p><p>And I'm absolutely loving it.</p><p>Regardless of where this journey takes me, I know that I'm thoroughly enjoying the ride. I believe that as long as I control my own destiny and am passionate about the space / journey / people, then great things are bound to happen along the way.</p><p>And this is a large part of why the passion economy resonates with me on such a deep and personal level.</p><h3 data-id="01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf"><a href="#01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf" title="Open Source Sustainability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Open Source Sustainability</span></h3><div><p>After <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit">nearly 20 years of contributing to open source</a>, I started this journey originally focused on the problem of open source sustainability.</p></div><p>For many software developers, open source is like the wild west. It represents a completely open territory to explore and paint my ideas upon with no rules or regulations. This has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coss.media/">unbelievably successful commercial open source products</a> being built that would've otherwise been very difficult to bring to market in a more traditional, closed source world. It's also led to an amazing amount of long-tail value creation and experimentation in the form of smaller OSS projects that have found insane amounts of adoption around the world.</p><p>I think it's safe to say that open source software has had profound effects on the world, but as with many passion projects, the key difficulty lies in making your passion sustainable. When you start off working on a project, it's almost always out of intrinsic motivation; that is to say, it's because you're excited about something and want to scratch your own itch. As your project(s) grow in popularity and usage over time, you inevitably get more and more support requests and people complaining about bugs or missing features. What started as a purely intrinsic passion project has now become a burden, and the only real way to reconcile this problem is to introduce extrinsic motivation (usually in the form of money or followers) that will help you sustain your interest in growing a community around your work.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of these talented indie devs out there who are passionate about open source. And more generally, there are millions of talented creators out there who are passionate about their own creative outlets, whether they be music, videos, teaching, writing, art, comedy, and so much more.</p><h3 data-id="72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f"><a href="#72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f" title="Human passion is universal"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Human passion is universal</span></h3><p>This brings me back to the passion economy and its cool cousin, the creator economy.</p><p>I fundamentally believe in the boundless potential of humanity. I know that sounds a little idealistic and bullshit-y, but you're literally reading a blog called Transitive Bullshit...</p><p>One thing that I find so much beauty in is all of the different ways that human creativity and passion manifest themselves.</p><p>No matter where you are in the world..</p><p>No matter what your background is..</p><p>No matter what your motivations are..</p><p>No matter what your creative outlets are..</p><p>No matter who you are..</p><p>The internet and platforms built on the internet unlock so much hidden opportunity for you.</p><p>Human passion is truly universal, and the internet is the ultimate tool to unlock the power of human creativity on a scale that is hard to comprehend. In this respect, I believe that we're still in the very early stages of discovering all of the second &amp; third order effects that the internet will have on humanity. I also love thinking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">humanity as a species that is experiencing an unprecedented rate of exponential evolution</a> and how fundamental forces like the internet, AI, and human passion are driving this evolution forward. It's an exciting time to be alive.</p><p>And these days, there are just so many inspirational stories out there of people striving to better themselves and help their audiences in unique, authentic, and creative ways.</p><p>Human passion and creativity are truly universal, and we're seeing a long-term change in the way people view their passions and creative outlets versus traditional work.</p><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAAAQAgCdASoQAA8ABUB8JbACsAERHzma9luAAP7v0t51jxw+/73aT08qIIRPHhVPfeRNAwJmGw5TOmQU0dwRAnPsxOGEaUzsAAA=" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async"><img src="https://ssfy.io/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fsecure.notion-static.com%252Ff89a085d-937e-49bd-9aac-a8a4fcb10f40%252FUntitled.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D95d34e25-7272-433e-8960-b302309e5a07%26cache%3Dv2" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></p></div><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life</a></figcaption></figure><h3 data-id="68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658"><a href="#68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658" title="Passion First, Economy Second"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Passion First, Economy Second</span></h3><p>I was recently listening to a Clubhouse room where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ljin18">Li Jin</a> (no surprise! haha) was interviewing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/allenlau">Allen Lau</a>, the co-founder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, a platform that makes it easy for writers to share stories, which just sold for $600M. One of the things which stood out for me was something Allen said about passion always coming first, and monetization coming second.</p><blockquote>"99% of people who write are motivated by their fanbase and engagement. Only a small portion really go into things focused on monetization." (Allen Lau)</blockquote><p>This is an incredibly important point to keep in mind, especially for founders building solutions in this space that naturally tend to focus on reducing barriers to monetization — because it's easier to get funding for products with clear monetization models.</p><p>This naturally leads to the question: is the "passion economy" even a good thing? Should our passions remain our passions and our work remain our work?</p><p>I think there's no one answer to this, but I can share two key insights that have really clicked with me recently.</p><p>The first insight is Li's answer to this question. She is a strong proponent of consumer choice and enabling the option to monetize as opposed to it being full of friction, and I couldn't agree with this more. The easier you make the option of monetizing your passion via different methods and platforms, the more creators will experiment with these solutions and naturally find a healthy balance that works for them.</p><p>The second insight comes from this article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/">my product is my garden</a>. The author does a great job exploring different forms of monetization and sustainability around his love for building software side projects. In the end, he views his work as a garden and finds peace in the process of tending to his garden.</p><h3 data-id="0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3"><a href="#0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3" title="Inspiration comes in many forms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Inspiration comes in many forms</span></h3><p>As I continue to explore the passion economy and the future of work, I'm actively looking to connect with other co-founders, developers, creators, and builders who are excited about this space.</p><p>I try to always keep in mind how small my view of the world is, so I'm looking to meet other passionate folks who will bring their own unique insights to the table in order to challenge my assumptions.</p><p>I'm particularly interested in building solutions that will help enable a more independent and fulfilling future of work. I believe that helping ambitious creators and domain experts to follow their passions via more sustainable, frictionless business models is one of the most important, impactful, and universal problems that we are uniquely poised to solve today.</p><p>This is a pretty grandiose mission when you think about it. It has a lot of overlap with:</p><ul><li>Traditional VC models of enabling entrepreneurship</li></ul><ul><li>Influencers and the future of media and entertainment</li></ul><ul><li>Evolving the concept of work from full-time employment to more flexible, lightweight models</li></ul><ul><li>Making knowledge more accessible at scale</li></ul><p>And finally, as an anime otaku myself, I wanted to leave you with one last bit of inspiration coming from an entirely different field.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                


<p>So, I moved places this year and for the first couple of weeks I used the
fritzbox 7350 from my ISP. While it’s good, it lacks the flexibility that I want
in my home network. I like some VLANs, some options to play with and a solid
control on my firewall.</p>

<h2>The hunt for a replacement</h2>

<p>My ISP has 3 requirements for a router:</p>

<ul>
<li>be able to build up a PPP connection,</li>
<li>support VLAN 10 tagging,</li>
<li>have Gigabit Ethernet ports (otherwise, the speed will be limited to 100 Mbps).</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve used an Ubiquiti Edgerouter lite 3 before of which I’m quite happy. It
offers a lot of solid features at a good pricepoint (and with some hacking, <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/edgerouter.lite#flash_layout">can
be flashed with other
OSes</a>). Some
router with good support for OpenWRT would also be a good fit.</p>

<p>But hearing some good things about the <a href="https://pcengines.ch/apu2.htm">PCEngine
APU2</a> boards (and it’s relatives) and it being
x86, offering most Linux flavors as OS and having quite the community behind
them, I ended up picking the <a href="https://pcengines.ch/apu2e4.htm">APU2E4</a>. This
mainly because the ,theoretically more performant Intel i210AT NIC vs Intel
i211AT NIC in the other models and with 3 ethernet ports I have enough.</p>

<h2>Installing Nixos</h2>

<p>After waiting a couple of days, all equipment has arrived and I can start
installing Nixos. This is easy enough:</p>

<ol>
<li>Construct the APU in it’s enclosure and mount the mSata drive</li>
<li>Flash Nixos image on USB drive</li>
<li>Insert USB drive in APU2</li>
<li>Connect console cable to APU</li>
<li>Boot (read the notes below)</li>
<li>Select the USB drive</li>
<li>Install Nixos according to the <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation">installation guide</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some remarks on the installation process:
* When booting, hit tab to edit the boot entry. Normally Nixos does not output to
  serial in the boot process, so we need to enable is by appending
  <code>console=ttyS0,115200</code> to the boot entry. All characters appear twice, so just
  make sure you type it correctyl ;) . <code>ctrl+l</code> can be used to refresh the screen.
* After installing, you want to make sure that the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/pcengines/apu/default.nix">PCEngine
  APU</a>
  entry from the Nixos hardware repo is present, as it enables the console port.</p>

<h2>Configuring as a router</h2>

<p>So, now we have an embedded device with Nixos, so lets turn this into a router.
First thing we’ll need to do is enable IP forwarding on this machine, since we’ll
definitely forward packets.</p>

<pre><code>boot.kernel.sysctl = {
  # if you use ipv4, this is all you need
  "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding" = true;

  # If you want to use it for ipv6
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" = true;

  # source: https://github.com/mdlayher/homelab/blob/master/nixos/routnerr-2/configuration.nix#L52
  # By default, not automatically configure any IPv6 addresses.
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra" = 0;
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf" = 0;
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr" = 0;

  # On WAN, allow IPv6 autoconfiguration and tempory address use.
  "net.ipv6.conf.${name}.accept_ra" = 2;
  "net.ipv6.conf.${name}.autoconf" = 1;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, lets configure some interfaces. The physical interfaces won’t be used by
me. I need a <code>wan</code> interface to handle the WAN side of the router. It’s couple to
the <code>wan</code> VLAN and doesn’t use DHCP since I’ll be setting up PPPoE on top of it.
And then we also have a <code>lan</code> and <code>iot</code> interface and VLAN, each we assign a
static IP to.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  useDHCP = false;
  hostName = "router";
  nameserver = [ "&lt;DNS IP&gt;" ];
  # Define VLANS
  vlans = {
    wan = {
      id = 10;
      interface = "enp1s0";
    };
    lan = {
      id = 20;
      interface = "enp2s0";
    };
    iot = {
      id = 90;
      interface = "enp2s0";
    };
  };

  interfaces = {
    # Don't request DHCP on the physical interfaces
    enp1s0.useDHCP = false;
    enp2s0.useDHCP = false;
    enp2s0.useDHCP = false;
    
    # Handle the VLANs
    wan.useDHCP = false;
    lan = {
      ipv4.addresses = [{
        address = "10.1.1.1";
        prefixLength = 24;
      }];
    };
    iot = {
      ipv4.addresses = [{
        address = "10.1.90.1";
        prefixLength = 24;
      }];
    };
  }:
};
</code></pre>

<p>So after a <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>, we should see all the interfaces and vlans
appear with the settings we specified. As mentioned before, I need a PPPoE
session. Luckily, Nixos makes this incredibly easy:</p>

<pre><code># setup pppoe session
services.pppd = {
  enable = true;
  peers = {
    edpnet = {
      # Autostart the PPPoE session on boot
      autostart = true;
      enable = true;
      config = ''
        plugin rp-pppoe.so wan
        
        # pppd supports multiple ways of entering credentials,
        # this is just 1 way
        name "${secrets.pppoe.username}"
        password "${secrets.pppoe.pass}"

        persist
        maxfail 0
        holdoff 5

        noipdefault
        defaultroute
      '';
    };
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>When the system starts up <code>pppd-edpnet.service</code>, you should now see a <code>ppp0</code>
interface with an IP address (note: if you already have a default gateway set on
the system when the PPPoE seesion comes online, it <strong>will not</strong> replace the
degault gateway).<br>
Now onto the firewall configuration. I prefer to use
<a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page">nftables</a>. So let’s
disable the Nixos firewall and enable nftables.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  ...
  nat.enable = false;
  firewall.enable = false;
  nftables = {
    enable = true;
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>And then we can setup a straight forward <code>nftables</code> ruleset for a basic firewall.
The <code>iot</code> vlan will get locked down, when we add devices to this later, we’ll
open op the vlan as is needed.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  ...
  nftables = {
    ...
    ruleset = ''
      table ip filter {
        # enable flow offloading for better throughput
        flowtable f {
          hook ingress priority 0;
          devices = { ppp0, lan };
        }

        chain output {
          type filter hook output priority 100; policy accept;
        }

        chain input {
          type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;

          # Allow trusted networks to access the router
          iifname {
            "lan",
          } counter accept

          # Allow returning traffic from ppp0 and drop everthing else
          iifname "ppp0" ct state { established, related } counter accept
          iifname "ppp0" drop
        }
        
        chain forward {
          type filter hook forward priority filter; policy drop;

          # enable flow offloading for better throughput
          ip protocol { tcp, udp } flow offload @f

          # Allow trusted network WAN access
          iifname {
                  "lan",
          } oifname {
                  "ppp0",
          } counter accept comment "Allow trusted LAN to WAN"

          # Allow established WAN to return
          iifname {
                  "ppp0",
          } oifname {
                  "lan",
          } ct state established,related counter accept comment "Allow established back to LANs"
      }

      table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
          type nat hook output priority filter; policy accept;
        }

        # Setup NAT masquerading on the ppp0 interface
        chain postrouting {
          type nat hook postrouting priority filter; policy accept;
          oifname "ppp0" masquerade
        } 
      }
    '';
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>This should cover a fairly basic <code>nftables</code> ruleset that offers internet
connectivity to <code>lan</code> and locks <code>iot</code> completely to local connections only. At
the end, lets install some handy packages for a router.</p>

<pre><code>environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  vim                 # my preferred editor
  htop                # to see the system load
  ppp                 # for some manual debugging of pppd
  ethtool             # manage NIC settings (offload, NIC feeatures, ...)
  tcpdump             # view network traffic
  conntrack-tools     # view network connection states
];
</code></pre>

<h2>DHCP server</h2>

<p>So, now that we got the routing part set up, we need to make sure that devices
that plug into these networks can get some IP addresses. For this, we spin up a
quick DHCP server on the router (or any other compute connected to the networks).</p>

<pre><code>services.dhcpd4 = {
    enable = true;
    interfaces = [ "lan" "iot" ];
    extraConfig = ''
      option domain-name-servers 10.5.1.10, 1.1.1.1;
      option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;

      subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option broadcast-address 10.1.1.255;
        option routers 10.1.1.1;
        interface lan;
        range 10.1.1.128 10.1.1.254;
      }

      subnet 10.1.90.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option broadcast-address 10.1.90.255;
        option routers 10.1.90.1;
        option domain-name-servers 10.1.1.10;
        interface iot;
        range 10.1.90.128 10.1.90.254;
      }
    '';
  };
</code></pre>

<h2>Performance tuning</h2>

<p>The squeeze the most out of this timy box, I played around a bit with some
interrupt steering and packet handling settings. After a few minutes I found what
seemed to work optimally for me and wrote up this little script that is called at
startup. It sets the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/performance_tuning_guide/s-cpu-irq">smp
affinity</a>
and
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/performance_tuning_guide/network-rps">RPS</a>.
Generally, you want to avoid CPU core handling the HW interrupts from SMP
affinity for RPS.</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env sh

smp1=8
rps1=7
smp2=8
rps2=7

# set balancer for enp1s0

<p>Hardly anyone nowadays believes the earth is flat. Many people, however, wrongly believe that people during the Middle Ages <em>thought</em> the world was flat. In reality, however, the sphericity of the earth was common knowledge throughout the entire Middle Ages. The idea that people in the Middle Ages thought the earth was flat is a canard invented in the Early Modern Period by authors who wanted to portray the Middle Ages as a time of backwardness and superstitious regression.</p>



<p><strong>Origins of the model of the spherical earth</strong></p>



<p>There really was a time when people did believe that the earth was flat, but it was long, <em>long</em> before the Middle Ages. Prior to around 500 BC or thereabouts, it seems most people believed that the earth was flat like a table and that the sky was a dome covering it. This, for instance, seems to have been the worldview of the ancient Sumerians and other early Mesopotamians, the pharaonic Egyptians, and the authors of the Hebrew Bible.</p>



<p>Interestingly, although the authors of the Hebrew Bible seem to agree that the earth is flat, they don’t seem to have had a clear impression of what shape it is. You can find contradictions about the shape of the earth even within the same book. For instance, the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+11%3A12&amp;version=NRSV">Book of Isaiah 11:12</a> mentions there being “four corners of the earth,” which makes it sound as though the earth is flat and shaped like a square. The <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A22&amp;version=NRSV">Book of Isaiah 40:22</a>, however, describes the earth as a “circle”:</p>



<blockquote><p>“It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;<br>who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spreads them like a tent to live in;”</p></blockquote>



<p>The early Greeks believed that the earth was flat too. The prevailing view among the early Greeks seems to have been that the earth was disc-shaped:</p>



<ul><li>The <em>Iliad </em>and the <em>Odyssey </em>describe the world as flat, with the Underworld lying beneath the ground and Tartaros lying beneath the Underworld.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The philosopher Anaximenes of Miletos (lived c. 586&nbsp;– c. 526 BC) describes the earth in fragment 13.A.6 as “πλατεῖαν μάλα,” which means “very flat.”</li></ul>



<ul><li>The philosopher Anaxagoras of Klazomenai (lived c. 510&nbsp;– c. 428&nbsp;BC) repeatedly describes the earth in his surviving fragments as “πλατείας,” meaning “flat.”</li></ul>



<ul><li>The poet Empedokles of Akragas (lived c. 494&nbsp;– c. 434&nbsp;BC) describes the earth in fragment 31.A.56 as “κυκλοτερής,” which means “circular” or “disc-shaped.”</li></ul>



<p>We do not know who the first person to propose the notion of the sphericity of the earth was. The Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtios, who lived in around the third century AD, cites conflicting reports in his book <em>The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</em> claiming that the sphericity of the earth was discovered by the poet Hesiodos of Askre (lived c. eighth century BC), by the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos (lived c. 570&nbsp;– c. 495&nbsp;BC), or by the philosopher Parmenides of Elea (lived c. 515 – late fifth century BC). Here is the passage in question, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+8.1">as translated by R.D. Hicks</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Favorinus says that our philosopher [i.e. Pythagoras] used definitions throughout the subject matter of mathematics ; their use was extended by Socrates and his disciples, and afterwards by Aristotle and the Stoics. Further, we are told that he was the first to call the heaven the universe and the earth spherical, though Theophrastus says it was Parmenides, and Zeno that it was Hesiod.”</p></blockquote>



<p>All three of these reports are most likely spurious. Hesiodos’s poems have survived and they strongly indicate that he believed the earth was flat. The claim that Pythagoras discovered the sphericity of the earth seems to be based solely on a pseudepigraphical poem written long after the historical Pythagoras’s death. Finally, we know about Parmenides’s cosmology from surviving fragments of his work and from his appearance in Plato’s dialogue <em>Parmenides</em> and he doesn’t seem to have been a round-earther.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Photograph <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kapitolinischer_Pythagoras_adjusted.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Wikimedia Commons</a> of a Roman marble bust of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras on display in the Capitoline Museum. The representation here is fictional; no one knows what Pythagoras really looked like.</em></p>



<p>We do know, however, that, by around the end of the fifth century BC or thereabouts, the sphericity of the earth was common knowledge among educated people in the Greek world. The Athenian philosopher Plato (lived c. 428 – c. 347 BC) explicitly describes the earth as spherical in his<em> Phaidon</em> 108d-109a, in which one of his speakers says this, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D108">as translated by Harold North Fowler</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“…the earth is round and in the middle of the heavens, it needs neither the air nor any other similar force to keep it from falling, but its own equipoise and the homogeneous nature of the heavens on all sides suffice to hold it in place; for a body which is in equipoise and is placed in the center of something which is homogeneous cannot change its inclination in any direction, but will remain always in the same position. This, then, is the first thing of which I am convinced.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Plato’s student Aristotle of Stageira (lived 384 – 322 BC), whose writings were widely studied during the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, presents several cogent arguments for the sphericity of the earth in <a href="https://archive.org/stream/worksaristotle06arisgoog#page/n368/mode/2up">Book Two of his treatise <em>On the Heavens</em></a>, based on empirical evidence:</p>



<ul><li>Gravity pulls all matter towards the center of the earth, which inevitably results in a planet that is roughly spherical.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The earth always casts a circular shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse. A sphere is the only shape that always casts a circular shadow no matter what direction the light is hitting it from.</li></ul>



<ul><li>When a person travels north or south, the stars that are visible change, meaning the surface of the earth must be curved.</li></ul>



<p>Aristotle’s evidence for the sphericity of the earth was so compelling that basically every educated person writing after him accepted the earth as spherical.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Photograph <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg">from Wikimedia Commons</a> of a Roman marble bust of Aristotle. The oldest surviving argument for the sphericity of the Earth based on empirical evidence comes from Aristotle</em>.</p>



<p>Perhaps the only Greek flat-earther after Aristotle who is worth mentioning is the philosopher Epikouros of Samos (lived 341 – 270 BC), a younger contemporary of Aristotle who founded his entire philosophy on the rejection of Plato and made a point to disagree with Plato on just about everything he possibly could.</p>



<p>Epikouros probably only embraced flat-earthism because he didn’t have access to a copy of Aristotle’s <i>On the Heavens</i> and he wasn’t aware of the empirical evidence for the sphericity of the earth. If he had had access to a copy of the book, I suspect he probably would have accepted that the earth is a sphere, since he firmly believed in empiricism.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence for belief in a spherical earth during the Middle Ages</strong></p>



<p>Knowledge of the sphericity of the earth did not disappear with the end of classical antiquity in the fifth century AD; on the contrary, sphericity remained well-known among scholars. The Northumbrian monk Bede the Venerable (lived c. 672 – 735 AD) clearly outlines the mainstream position of medieval scholars in his treatise <em>On the Reckoning of Time</em>, which is that the earth is roughly a sphere. Bede writes in chapter 46, as translated by William D. McCready:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We refer to the sphere of the earth, not that it is perfectly spherical in shape, given the great difference of mountains and plains, but that it would constitute a perfectly formed sphere if all of the lines were enclosed in the circumference of its circuit. Hence it is that the stars of the northern region are always visible to us, while southern ones never are. Conversely, these northern stars are never seen in southern regions, owing to the obstruction of the globe of the earth. The country of the Troglodytes, and Egypt, which is adjacent to it, do not see the Great and Little Bear, and Italy does not see Canopus.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Around five hundred years after Bede, a scholar named Johannes de Sacrobosco (lived c. 1195 – c. 1256 AD) wrote an introductory astronomy textbook titled <em>Tractatus de Sphaera</em>, which was used for centuries after his death and has survived to the present day. In the very first chapter, Johannes states that the earth is a sphere and explains how astronomers know this. Here is his explanation, as translated by Lynn Thorndike:</p>



<blockquote><p>“That the earth, too, is round is shown thus. The signs and stars do not rise and set the same for all men everywhere but rise and set sooner for those in the east than for those in the west; and of this there is no other cause than the bulge of the earth. Moreover, celestial phenomena evidence that they rise sooner for Orientals than for westerners.

<p>After reviewing countless resumes at Amazon and in my free time, I was surprised to find that the majority of them lacked substance. It was as if I were living in Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em>– where everyone’s story was the same and there was little to no sense of individuality.</p>



<p>This is odd for multiple reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, everyone is different. These differences are what define us. Owning your individuality will help you stand out and set you apart from thousands of other applicants that look the same on paper.</p>



<p>Reflecting on my experience, it’s evident that most people don’t personalize their resume enough. And I’m not talking about updating your resume with zany fonts and layouts. I’m talking about leveraging your specific accomplishments and the impact they’ve made.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that a lot of the advice out there focuses on the minutia- font, margin size, keywords etc. Don’t get me wrong, these are important, but what’s more important is effectively conveying your worth through strong personal experiences.</p>



<p>I’m going to explain how you can do this in three steps.</p>



<h3>Why you should care</h3>



<p>According to a 2018 <a href="https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, you have an average of <strong>7 seconds</strong> to impress your recruiter before it’s too late.</p>



<p>Your resume is your most important asset in getting you noticed by companies. It’s your first opportunity to make a good impression. Therefore, writing a winning software engineering resume is crucial for landing interviews. This is especially the case at competitive companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc.</p>



<p>So here we go.</p>



<h3>The three steps to writing a winning resume</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<ol id="block-aed15bc6-0960-4d86-ade0-5754af74923e" tabindex="0" role="group" contenteditable="true" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Block: List" data-block="aed15bc6-0960-4d86-ade0-5754af74923e" data-type="core/list" data-title="List">
<li>Use your accomplishments</li>
<li>Be specific</li>
<li>Add supporting data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: I won’t be covering how to format your resume in this post. If you need help on that, check out <a href="https://github.com/jakeryang/resume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake’s resume</a> as a starting point.</em></p>



<p>Let’s walk through each of these steps by understanding why they’re important, and build up to an example that’s on my actual resume.</p>



<h5>1. Use your accomplishments <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-accomplishments" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>I’ve seen too many resumes where candidates merely list their job responsibilities as bullet points under their Work Experience. This is absolutely not the way to go.</p>



<p>Responsibilities across software engineering roles are largely the same. They generally include writing testable code, designing systems, integrating software components, etc. Recruiters and hiring managers don’t care about what you were supposed to do; they care about <strong>what</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>actually</strong> <strong>accomplished</strong>. Let’s look at an example.</p>



<p><strong>Bad</strong>: <em>“<span>Responsible for designing systems and writing testable code to satisfy customer requirements</span>”</em><br><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“<span>Designed and implemented an internal tool for customers</span>”</em></p>



<p>Notice how I’ve differentiated myself by simply using a personal accomplishment instead of a job responsibility.</p>



<p>Although this is an improvement, it’s not quite there yet. Keep reading to see how we can build on this example by being specific and adding data.</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have many accomplishments?<br></strong>This is common for college students looking for their first internship or job. I recommend that you focus on highlighting your accomplishments and passion for engineering through <strong>personal projects</strong>.</p>
<hr>



<h5>2. Be specific <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-specifics" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>It’s all in the details. Details add scope, perspective, and give the recruiter a deeper look into your work. They also give the recruiter additional information for whether you’d be a good fit for the role. Don’t be vague, but at the same time, don’t provide excessive detail.</p>



<p>Let’s further differentiate ourselves by adding specific details to our example from the previous step.</p>



<p><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“Designed and implemented a <span>self-service</span> internal tool for clients <span>to onboard onto CompanyName’s customer relationship management system</span>”</em></p>



<p>Notice how you can now tell that the candidate has experience with CRMs and onboarding automation for clients. This is a lot better than what we started with.</p>



<h5>3. Add supporting data <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-data" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>Most candidates don’t use data to quantify the impact of their accomplishments. This puts them at a disadvantage because recruiters won’t have much insight into why their accomplishments are important.</p>



<p>Let’s pretend I optimized a web app to reduce page-load latency. What was the impact? Was it a reduction in latency? If so, how much did I reduce it by? It’s important to mention <strong>what</strong> the impact was, and <strong>how much</strong> impact it had.</p>



<p>Let’s wrap up the example by adding data to quantify its impact.</p>



<p><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“Designed and implemented a self-service internal tool for clients to onboard onto CompanyName’s customer relationship management system, <span>reducing client onboarding time by 85% (14 hrs to 2 hrs)</span>“</em></p>



<p>Notice how adding the <strong>what</strong> (reducing client onboarding time) and the <strong>how much</strong> (by 85%) elevate the accomplishment significantly, setting it apart from others.</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have data for my accomplishments?<br></strong>Do your best to get the data. It’s a bit more challenging if you no longer have access to that data (e.g. you left the company), but you may consider reaching out to your old manager if that’s the case.&nbsp; <strong>Protip</strong>: Always add metrics to your work.</p>
<hr>



<h2>What Now?</h2>



<p>There you have it- three steps to writing a winning resume by focusing on your individual accomplishments. In the words of Winnie the Pooh, “<em>the things that make me different are the things that make me.</em>” So go forth, iterate on your resume, and make it your own.</p>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-02-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2021-02-02</span>.</p>
<p>In my previous article "Why you should migrate everything from Linux to BSD", in the <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/why-you-should-migrate-everything-from-linux-to-bsd.html#license">License problems</a> section, I very briefly addressed one of the problems with the GPL license. I have since received a few emails asking for elaboration on the subject, which is what I will try to do in this article.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-gpl">What is the GPL?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU Public License (GPL)</a> was created to be the "antithesis" of the standard proprietary license. Any modifications that were made to GPL licensed software required to be given back to the GPL community and any application that used or linked to GPL source code was required to be under the GPL.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the GPL is to disallow incorporation of GPL licensed software into proprietary software.</p>
<p>The GPL is rather complex:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You cannot sell GPL licensed software, but you can charge as much as you want for distributing, supporting, or documenting the software.</li>
    <li>If GPL licensed source code is required for a program to compile, the program must also be under the GPL. Linking statically to a GPL library requires a program to be under the GPL.</li>
    <li>Because the Linux kernel is licensed under the GPL, any code statically linked with the Linux kernel must be GPL licensed itself. This requirement can be avoided by dynamically linking loadable kernel modules. This permits companies to distribute binary drivers, but has the disadvantage that they will only work for a particular versions of the Linux kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the complexity of the GPL, its legality is mainly being ignored in many parts of the world in regard to Linux and related software.</p>

<h2 id="hijacking">The GPL encourages "hijacking" and political maneuverings</h2>
<p>The GPL and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction that source code must be distributed or made available for all works that are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code.</p>
<p>While this may look like a noble strategy, it is a condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software. In practice, it usually ends up hindering free sharing and reuse of code and ideas rather than encouraging it.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that when a company cannot fully control how they share their code, they either don't use the software, or instead try hard to "hijack" the project by political maneuvering, as we have seen with e.g. Red Hat.</p>
<p>Pressure to put proprietary applications on Linux became overwhelming in the beginning of 1990. Such applications often must link with system libraries. The pressure was so great that it resulted in a modified version of the GPL called the LGPL ("Library", since renamed to "Lesser", GPL). The LGPL allows proprietary code to be linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library">GNU C library (glibc)</a>. You do not have to release the source code which has been dynamically linked to an LGPL licensed library. On the other hand, if you statically link an application with glibc, which is what is very often required in embedded systems, you cannot keep your application proprietary, that is, the source must be released.</p>
<p>This kind of restriction sometimes put a company in a sore spot. Instead of releasing source code they try to influence the upstream project by hiring one or more of the developers, and then try to effect the project to make changes upstream that helps the company implement whatever solutions they require. Once this political maneuvering begins it often has very damaging result on the free software community because it doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>One such clear example is Red Hat trying hard to get rid of the <code>/etc</code> configuration directory on Linux.</p>
<p>Red Hat wants this change because in their specific business product for the embedded market, <code>/etc</code> gets in the way. Having Linux as an operating system not depend upon <code>/etc</code> is very important for Red Hat, which is also why they have hardcoded DNS servers from Google, Cloudflare and Quad9 into the systemd-resolved network application, so that it can run completely without any setup in <code>/etc</code>. This is also why they are trying to change the way home directories work and systemd-homed is the first major step in that direction. Getting rid of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and related files is currently one of the top priority projects at Red Hat as that will enable getting rid of the rest of <code>/etc</code> more easily.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the corporate interests of Red Hat is the very reason behind the existence of systemd in the first place. And it is also the very reason why systemd isn't just an init system, but rather has become a huge pile of interdependent building blocks to make "an operating system" that better serves their interests, both in their embedded market and on the other market shares they have.</p>
<p>Red Hat needs these major changes to become an integrated part of the major Linux distributions such that all third party software works on this setup, rather than on the current setup in which Red Hat have to work around a lot of issues, which is both very time consuming and difficult.</p>
<p>As I have already explained in my article <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>, Red Hat addressed several third party projects and tried to convince them to make their projects depend upon systemd, such as the attempts made by Lennart Poettering on <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-May/msg00427.html">the Gnome mailing list</a>, and the attempt made by Red Hat developer "keszybz" on the <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/428">tmux project</a>. Most of these attempts were disguised as technical issues, however when you read the long email correspondence on the Gnome mailing list and elsewhere, the real intent becomes quite clear.</p>
<p>In another example, Red Hat purchased Cygnus, an engineering company that had taken over development of the FSF compiler tools. Cygnus had developed a business model in which they sold support for GNU software. This enabled them to employ some 50 engineers and drive the direction of the programs by contributing the preponderance of modifications.</p>
<p>While the Linux kernel and Linux distributions used to be mainly community driven projects, the corporate interests of some of the major companies has changed this a lot. Some contributions has benefitted the communities, but a lot of maneuverings has not, and currently Linux, as an operating system (not the kernel alone) is undergoing major changes, changes that reach out far beyond the kernel and the GNU tools.</p>
<p>This kind of "hijacking" and political maneuverings never happen with a permissive license like the BSD or MIT licenses.</p>
<p>With a permissive license the company can do whatever they want. The situation never arises in which it becomes a part of their interest to "hijack" the upstream project or directly influence they way it is going.</p>
<p>On the contrary, companies who benefit from the permissive license often contribute code back to the project because it is in their interest to have their contributions available in the source code, while at the same time they keep "specific company related" changes private.</p>
<p><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>, which is release under a permissive license, and which originally is a project started at Apple in 2005, is another really good example of the problems with the GPL. GCC is licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3, which requires developers who distribute extensions for, or modified versions of, GCC to make their source code available, whereas LLVM, which is the clang backend, has a BSD-like license that does not have that requirement.</p>
<p>Because of this Apple chose to develop a new compiler front end from scratch, supporting C, Objective-C and C++. The clang project was then open sourced in 2007 and now contributors who is making improvements and changes to both LLVM and clang includes several of the free software projects such as all the BSD projects, and it also includes major companies like Microsoft, Google, ARM, Sony, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).</p>
<p>Because the GCC source code is a large and difficult system for developers to work with, and because companies often develop specific extensions which they do not want to share, the GCC is now slowly being abandoned, not benefiting from any of the major improvements, and instead a real free alternative is slowly taking its place.</p>

<h2 id="damage">The damage done by proprietary companies</h2>
<p>Some companies will make improvements which they never share when they build software with a permissive license and they will possibly even make billions of dollars doing it. But this is really not damaging free software in the least.</p>
<p>What is being damaged is society in general, such as the damage done by Microsoft, Apple and Google with their proprietary spyware operating systems, their copyright licenses and their creepware.</p>
<p>But this damage has absolutely nothing to do with the free software. This damage is the result of the capitalistic political system, and this damage will always exist as long as the political system favors profit over people.</p>
<p>And of course the damage that the capitalistic political system is causing is not limited to software or freedom, but extends its greedy reach far into all the other corners of life with devastating consequences as a result. Just look at the current global environment crisis! Or the global rise of extreme poverty! Or the horrifying treatment of animals! All in the name of profit!</p>
<p>Whether the GPL or more free software licenses exist or not, this greed and the damage caused by it will always exist. The point is that the GPL doesn't help in the least. The damage will be done regardless of what software licenses are in usage, and it is a problem that needs to be addressed on the political arena, not on the software development arena.</p>
<p>The very "soul" of a true free license is encouraging cooperation, it is helping people, and thereby also companies (as they consists of people working together), to see that it doesn't benefit …</p></article></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/">Part 4 </a>I continued the repairs and donated the money from the first batch of the repaired Pis to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. <br></p>



<p>In this post I will be covering what the money went towards and go over the current repair status.</p>



<blockquote><p>I’ve confirmed that your donation has been allocated to Pi Drop. It should fund approximately three deployments of Pi 400+monitor+webcam to disadvantaged young people in the UK. Thanks again for the donation (and for putting more Pi 1 units back in the field).</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The money donated so far has funded three computers for disadvantaged young people that require a computer to learn from home. Whilst this might not seem like a lot from selling 27 Raspberry Pi 1’s please keep in mind this includes a Raspberry Pi 400 or a Raspberry Pi 4 with keyboard, mouse, monitor and SD card. </p>



<p>In terms of continuing the repairs and donations I have a goal in my head that I would like to meet and I will be listing a further 30 repaired  Model B’s for sale today!</p>



<p>I will also be listing 10 “Model A’s” – More about these below.</p>



<h2>Salvaging dead Pis by removing components</h2>



<p>I came across a fair amount of Pis with dead Ethernet and/or dead USB ports. This issue was caused by a failed Ethernet IC.</p>



<p>Eben Upton did offer to see if they had any spare Ethernet IC’s for the Pi 1. I could have used them to restore full functionality to these devices however I had already started converting them to Model As and the chance of spare IC’s for such an old device laying around seemed slim. </p>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;was thinking perhaps we might have some 9512 chips lying around, but it’s been so long since we transitioned to 9514 that we almost certainly don’t.</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead I removed the Ethernet IC and associated circuitry – More of this can be seen in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>I have completed 10 of these so far and they will also be listed for sale today! </p>



<p>These devices are almost identical to the original Model A with the missing Ethernet port, IC and top USB port. <br></p>

<p>Some of these boards might have residual flux left over from the repairs although I have cleaned them up as best as I can! </p>



<p>They also have a mixture of 256MB and 512MB of RAM meaning some of them are an upgrade over the original model A!</p>



<h2>Replacing damaged SD card slots</h2>



<p>I already went over this in<a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/"> part 4</a> however I’m further along with the repairs. 30 of these have been repaired in total so far and I also re-enforced the slots with a small amount of Epoxy Resin to stop them being snapped from the board. <br></p>

<p>Please keep in mind when purchasing these – Not all of the Pi’s listed for sale today will include a new SD card slot. Some of the Pis literally had the SD card slots ripped off damaging the pads and a small amount of the devices have had trace wires added to the board to repair the missing pads. These are small and almost unnoticeable but please keep this in mind! </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>These devices are now listed for sale – as with the last batch the Model Bs will be sold in pairs with one device having been repaired previously and the other working but not repaired. Although both devices have been tested and proved to work I will only guarantee one of the Pis. </p><p>Model Bs x2 for £15: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-b-x2/274673808835</p><p>Model As x1 for £7: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-A/274673810787</p><p>All money raised from these will be donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>If you have any thoughts on this please let me know below! </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>February 06, 2021</p></header><section><p>As companies had to adjust to remote working last year, many were open to hiring outside their location.  When deciding what to pay a software engineer, most do a quick search for market rates in that area and then offer a salary around that rate.</p>
<p>I have been working remotely from Mexico for years and have also hired freelance software engineers and designers.  I have had no shortage of work at multiples of the market rate (a few thousand dollars a month) in my area, Guadalajara, for years.  If you make me an offer at market rates, I will never accept.  Neither would many other engineers I have met in Guadalajara who also earn significantly more than the market rate.</p>
<p>Companies that are known for adjusting heavily for the cost of living, such as GitLab, tend to offer low salaries even considering market rates. Whenever I encounter this situation, I can guarantee the company is not hiring the best engineers in the area.</p>
<p>I recently received an email for a job that pays in the range of 110k - 170k USD.  If I actively search for a job, I know I can find more offers of a similar, or better, salary range.  I was 22 when I was no longer “employable” in Mexico because of the salary I demanded.</p>
<p>I have learned that there are two types of companies that hire remotely.  The first type looks to hire engineers at a cheaper rate.  The second type wants to hire the best engineers.  Be the latter.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

  <p>I’ve been using <a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a> for the past few months to track things in my life.</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/nomie.jpeg" alt="Nomie">
<p>For example, I can tap <strong>Coffee</strong> to record a cup of coffe (<code>#coffee</code>), select <strong>Mood</strong> and <strong>3</strong> to record my mood (<code>#mood(3)</code>), or type <code>I have a #headache</code> to record a headache.</p>
<p>Recently, I tried to track my water intake. Whenever I drank some water, I counted the number of sips and logged them into Nomie (<code>#water(5)</code>). It worked for a few days, but it quickly became tedious. There had to be a better way.</p>

<p>I looked online for smart water bottles, but these kept showing up:</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/smart-water.png" alt="Smartwater bottles">
<p>Eventually, I came upon <a href="https://hidratespark.com/">HidrateSpark</a>, a brand of smart water bottles that pair to your phone via Bluetooth and automatically track your water intake. They looked cool, but their starting $60 price tag seemed a bit steep.</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/hidratespark3.gif" alt="HydrateSpark 3">
<p>I happen to quite like my current water bottle. Paired with <a href="https://www.humangear.com/gear/capcap">humangear’s capCAP</a>, my <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/">Hydro Flask</a> bottle is hard to beat. If only it were smarter…</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/hydroflask.jpg" alt="Hydro Flask 40oz + humangear's capCAP">
<p>I tried to make it smart. I really did. I spent way too much time researching and designing a device that would make any wide-mouth bottle smart. Wireless charging, ultrasonic transducer, Bluetooth Low Energy; I had put all the important keywords together. My <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a> cart was overflowing with electronic parts, despite never having held a soldering iron in my life. The scope creep became difficult to ignore. NFC tags would be easier.</p>

<p>Years ago, I purchased a bunch of NFC tags. I thought they were cool, but I never found a use for them. Until now. I would put them on my bottles and touch them with my phone whenever I took a sip. Genius.</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/nfc-tags.jpg" alt="A bunch of NFC tags.">
<p>The first thing I learned was that NFC tags don’t play well with metal surfaces. My phone wasn’t broken, my tags weren’t broken, but my knowledge of electromagnetic induction was broken. I had put the tag on a metal bottle, and no amount of touching it with my phone would fool physics.</p>
<p>Putting it on the cap, which is made of plastic, solved the issue.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert photo of bottle with NFC tag on cap. -->
<p>The second thing I learned was that NFC tags don’t know they’re on a water bottle, or supposed to track water intake. In fact, my tags didn’t know anything. They were empty, and I had to put data on them.</p>
<p>When I track my water intake with Nomie, it creates a note that looks like <code>#water(5)</code>, indicating that I had 5 sips of water. If touching the tag with my phone meant I took 1 sip of water, then its content should be something like <code>#water(1)</code>. I used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">NFC Tools</a> to write <code>#water(1)</code> to the tag.</p>
<p>The third thing I learned was that Nomie doesn’t support NFC tags. When my phone touches an NFC tag containing <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a>, it knows to open Google in a browser. When my phone touches an NFC tag containing <code>#water(1)</code>, it doesn’t even flinch. I needed to teach my phone to notice this tag and tell Nomie about it.</p>
<p>Many apps can be used to do that. Although I started with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">Tasker</a>, I ended up using <a href="https://llamalab.com/automate/">Automate</a>, which I find much more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>My Automate flow works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detect NFC tags whose content match the regex <code>#.*(.*)</code></li>
<li>Create a deep link that adds a note to Nomie: <br><code>https://open.nomie.app/history?note=#water(1)</code></li>
<li>Open the deep link</li>
</ol>
<p>I touched the tag with my phone, and it worked!</p>
<video width="360" height="640" controls="">
  <source src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/nomie-nfc.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Over time, I made some improvements to my Automate flow to make it more generic and useful. For example, I can change the content of my NFC tag from <code>#water(1)</code> to <code>#water(?)</code>, which will prompt me to input the number of sips when I trigger the NFC tag. Likewise, I can change <code>#water</code> to any other tag, such as <code>#coffee</code>, <code>#beer</code>, or <code>#ibuprofen</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re an Android user, <a href="https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/33417">you can download my Automate flow here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an iOS user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/dt32tl/auto_log_18oz_of_water_when_i_scan_the_nfc_sticker/">you can use Shortcuts to implement something similar</a>.</p>

<p>Tracking water intake is just the tip of the NFC tracking iceberg.</p>
<p>While it really shines when tracking frequent activies, such as drinking water, it can reduce friction when tracking pretty much anything. And because NFC tags are so cheap (less than $0.25), why not stick them all over the place?</p>
<p>Just think of the opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#beer</code> on your beer coaster</li>
<li><code>#peed</code> on the toilet flush</li>
<li><code>#sneezed</code> on your Kleenex box</li>
<li><code>#flossed</code> on your dental floss</li>
<li><code>#mood(?)</code> on your mirror</li>
<li><code>#water(?)</code> on a water bottle</li>
<li><code>#weight(?)</code> on a body weight scale</li>
<li><code>#pullup(?)</code> on a pull-up bar</li>
<li><code>#spent(?)</code> on your wallet</li>

  <p>Feb 6, 2021</p>
  <p>If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> document next to <code>README</code> and <code>CONTRIBUTING</code>.
Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another “docs are good, write more docs” advice.
I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, eg, I often use just “simplify” as a commit message.
Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you:-)</p>
<p>I have experience with both contributing to and maintaining open-source projects.
One of the lessons I’ve learned is that the biggest difference between an occasional contributor and a core developer lies in the knowledge about the physical architecture of the project.
Roughly, it takes 2x more time to write a patch if you are unfamiliar with the project, but it takes 10x more time to figure out <em>where</em> you should change the code.
This difference might be hard to perceive if you’ve been working with the project for a while.
If I am new to a code base, I read each file as a sequence of logical chunks specified in some pseudo-random order.
If I’ve made significant contributions before, the perception is quite different.
I have a mental map of the code in my head, so I no longer read sequentially.
Instead, I just jump to where the thing should be, and, if it is not there, I move it.
Mental map is the source of truth.</p>
<p>I find <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> file to be a low-effort high-leverage way to bridge this gap.
As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project.
Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it.
Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change.
This is the main rule of thumb for <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change.
Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code.
Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</p>
<p>Start with a bird’s eye overview of the problem being solved.
Then, specify a more-or-less detailed codemap.
Describe coarse-grained modules and how they relate to each other.
Codemap should answer “where’s the thing that does X?”.
It should also answer “what does the thing that I am looking at do?”.
Avoid going into details of <em>how</em> each module works, pull this into separate documents or (better) inline documentation.
Codemap is a map of a country, and not an atlas of maps of its states.
Use this as a chance to reflect on the project structure.
Are the things you want to put near each other in the codemap adjacent in <code>exa -TD</code>?</p>
<p>Do name important files, modules, and types.
Do not directly link them (links go stale).
Instead, encourage the reader to use symbol search to find the mentioned entities by name.
This doesn’t require maintenance, and will help to discover related, similarly named things.</p>
<p>Explicitly call-out architectural invariants.
Often, important invariants are expressed as an <em>absence</em> of something, and it’s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code.
Nothing in the model layer specifically doesn’t depend on the views.</p>
<p>Point out boundaries between layers and systems as well.
A boundary implicitly contains information about the implementation of the system behind it.
It even constraints all <em>possible</em> implementations.
But finding a boundary by just randomly looking at the code is hard — good boundaries have measure zero.</p>
<p>After finishing the codemap, add a separate section on cross-cutting concerns.</p>
<p>A good example of <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> document is the one from rust-analyzer:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/d7c99931d05e3723d878bea5dc26766791fa4e69/docs/dev/architecture.md">architecture.md</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-11"></blockquote><p>
otherwise the punctuation will go in it. Another common use case is:
</p><div id="code-29">
<pre><code>As mentioned on the tutorial (http://example.com[see this link]).
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-12"></blockquote></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-66">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-66"><p>If you want your link to include one of the terminating characters, e.g. <code>]</code>, all characters can be escaped with a backslash, e.g.:
</p><div id="code-30">
<pre><code>Hello http://example.com/\]a\}b\\c\ d world.
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-13"></blockquote></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-69">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-69"><p>Note that the <code>http://example.com</code> inside <code>\a[http://example.com]</code> only works because we do some post-processing magic that prevents its expansion, otherwise the link would expand twice:
</p><div id="code-31">
<pre><code>\P[http://example.com]

\a[http://example.com]
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-14"></blockquote><p>
This magic can be observed with <a href="#help-macros" title="internal link
word count: 0
descendant count: 14
descendant word count: 14"><code>--help-macros</code></a> by seeing that the <code>href</code> argument of the <code>a</code> macro has the property:

<p data-css="tve-u-1771d6b107a">KiCad 6.0 is expected to arrive in the second or third quarter of 2021 and is the first major release since 2018. I took much of January to "play" with the KiCad nightly builds, tagged "KiCad 5.99", which will eventually become KiCad 6.0.</p>
<p data-css="tve-u-1771d6af22e">In this article, I document many of the most important changes that the KiCad developers have introduced to KiCad 6, including numerous "under the hood" improvements, and new productivity features in the front end.</p>

<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto" spellcheck="true">
<p dir="ltr">KiCad is arguably the world’s best open-source printed circuit board CAD program.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s been around for almost 30 years. Its community has been growing steadily both in terms of end-users and contributors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad’s importance as a fully-featured alternative to closed-sources PCB design tools has grown since version 4 came out in 2015. That’s about the time that I committed to using KiCad, after playing around with other commercial and open-source alternatives. I was so impressed with KiCad that I decided to teach others how to use it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m pleased with my choice. As an educator and electronics hobbyist, KiCad has everything I need, without the limits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When KiCad 5 came out in July 2018, KiCad presented an image of maturity. In my opinion, KiCad 5 was a significant milestone in its history because it signified a new approach to the development of the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The core development team, composed of members that give most of their time to the project, is supported by community donations and CERN.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 5 raised KiCad as a serious contender in the PCB CAD space. KiCad 5 was powerful enough to be used in corporate engineering departments as well as by hobbyists.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After more than two years since the publication of version 5, version 6 is visible in the horizon. I expect that KiCad 6.0 will become a reality sometime in the second or (more likely) third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wanted to take a deep dive in KiCad 6 and report on my findings in this article. As I am writing this post, it is middle of January 2021, a few months after a feature freeze was declared in late 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After months of playing with the nightly builds containing the work in progress towards KiCad 6.0, I decided that it was time to take a closer look.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I felt confident that my findings would be useful to anyone wondering about KiCad 6.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this article, I document the most important new and updated features coming in KiCad 6.0. In many cases, I make a Kicad 6 vs KiCad 5 comparison so that you can see these changes in context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For my testing, I use the nightly build of KiCad, which is currently labelled “5.99”. The nightly development builds are snapshots of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">development branch</a> of the KiCad repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m running KiCad 5.99 on an <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 20.04</a> virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to learn how to install the nightly build, look for instructions at the end of this article.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am comparing KiCad 5.99 (which will morph into KiCad 6 later this year) with <a href="https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/tree/5.1.9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KiCad 5.1.9</a> running on an <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 18.04</a> virtual machine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please note that I will be using the designation “KiCad 6” in this article, even though I did my testing on the KiCad nightly release designated “KiCad 5.99”. During this article’s writing, I updated my copy of KiCad 5.99 almost daily to make sure I worked with the latest available code.</p>

<h2 id="t-1611031599240">KiCad 6 impressions in a nutshell</h2>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 6 includes several big changes and many smaller ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many of those changes are under the hood, designed to improve reliability and performance and set the stage for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, there are numerous changes in the front end, the user interface, that will impact how you interact with KiCad.</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599241">New file format</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">In my opinion, the most significant changes are the ones we can’t see.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the top of these changes, you’ll find the introduction of a new format for the schematic files, which uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S-Expressions notation</a>. S-Expressions can represent data in a tree structure format as a nested list. The new file format makes schematic and layout file human-readable, and, just as important, much easier to manipulate programmatically using Python or other programming languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">S-Expression notation is not new to KiCad. Layout (".kicad_pcb") and footprint files (".kicad_mod") have used S-Expression notation in KiCad 5. But with KiCad 6, the transition is complete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bellow, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the same schematic file section. KiCad 6 on the left, KiCad 5 on the right. In both cases, the text describes a PWR symbol with designation “PWR07”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The new S-Expressions notation file format is more verbose and takes more disk space, but it is much easier to read, edit by hand, or edit programmatically.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Symbol libraries are also moving to S-Expressions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new file format means that the main KiCad apps can soon be complemented by an abundance of plugins and extensions that can introduce new features. Think of plugins that can import PCB projects from other CAD programs or wizards that can create a new KiCad project within milliseconds to save you time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new file format is not backward compatible. You will not be able to open a KiCad 6 file with KiCad 5, but you will be able to import KiCad 5 projects and convert them to KiCad 6.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another important attribute of the new file format for Eeschema is that schematic symbols will be embedded to the file (not linked, as they currently are). This means that in KiCad 6, Eeschema files will be self-contained and will not depend on libraries. You will be able to publish and share these files and be sure that they will open properly on other people's KiCad 6 instances. No more "[??]" indicating broken links to symbol libraries.</p>

<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599242">Tools and Workflow</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">If you already know how to use KiCad 5, or even KiCad 4, you will find that the KiCad 6 individual apps also known as “tools”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You still have the main KiCad app, which allows you to launch the individual apps:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Eeschema,&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Pcbnew,</li>
<li dir="ltr">the editors for custom symbols and footprints,&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">and auxiliary apps like the Gerber file viewer, the image converter, the calculators and the schematic worksheet editor.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Some of these tools, like the Convert Image tool, are virtually unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most tools, however, contain small or significant improvements without changing their traditional look and feel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The KiCad workflow is also streamlined without changing its fundamentals. You will still create PCBs by iterating through Eeschema and Pcbnew, but the two tools are now better integrated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s good—no need to re-learn KiCad.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599243">User interface</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 6 features a refreshed user interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layout of the menus and windows has been improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Menu items have been re-organised to make them easier to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Toolbars have also been updated. Almost all buttons have been redesigned with an elegant modern look, but match one-on-one with their original counterparts from KiCad 5.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Pcbnew you will find that the right toolbar has been greatly expanded to include many brand-new productivity-enhancing tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most dialogue boxes have also been redesigned.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both Eeschema and Pcbnew have updated Setup dialogue boxes under the File menu. With these dialogue boxes, you can define many of the attributes of your schematic and layout design working environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These Setup windows also existed in KiCad 5, but in KiCad 6 they were expanded to include features distributed in other menus and windows. Having one place with all (or at least most) configuration capabilities represents another productivity boost.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Eeschema, the Electrical Rules Check capabilities are …</p></div></div></div></div>

Popular air purifier brands are making a lot of promises about what they can do to keep your home safe, but a CBC <em>Marketplace</em> investigation found that a homemade DIY purifier can actually outperform some of the most well-known brands on the market.</p>  <p>There are plenty of claims for consumers to wade through: "the only air purifier, heater&nbsp;and fan to clean a whole room properly;" "UV-C light killing germs;" and "true HEPA filter" are just some of the promises <em>Marketplace </em>investigated.</p>  <p>University of Toronto engineering professor Jeffrey Siegel, a leading expert on ventilation, filtration and indoor air quality, calls it "a marketing jungle."</p>  <p>Working with Siegel and his team, <em>Marketplace</em> put five popular brands to the test: the Levoit LV-H132, GermGuardian AC5350B, Dyson Pure Hot + Cool, BlueAir Blue Pure 211+ and the Honeywell HPA 160, as well as a DIY box fan with an added filter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Air purifier sales in Canada jumped nine per cent in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic 2019, totalling $136 million, according to statistics from market research firm Euromonitor.</p>  <h2>Clearing out COVID-19</h2>  <p>Siegel said a good air purifier can also help clear out coronavirus particles and reduce the air's viral load.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Jeffrey Siegel is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who has been studying indoor air quality for over 20 years.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Anu Singh/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But air purifiers need to be efficient and sized appropriately for the space they are in. Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too. Viruses such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often attach themselves to dust or droplets, and a good air purifier with a HEPA filter can help capture them.</p>  <p>All <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1"><u>HEPA filters</u></a> are supposed to remove at least 99.97 per cent of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and airborne particles. All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke, Siegel and his team tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products. Here’s what we found.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:09</span></span></span></p>  <p>The CADR measures how long an air-purifying device takes to remove pollen, smoke and dust; different CADR numbers correspond to each one. The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms. The smoke CADR is generally the lowest and most conservative number, said Siegel.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;|&nbsp;Here's how our test worked:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854855747661-metadata-" title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/481/295/mp_amy_embedded_xcode_mix_320_frame_856.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>University of Toronto PhD student Amy Li explains how the lab calculates the clean air delivery rate.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:33</span></span></span></p>  <p>Siegel also threw another set of air purifiers into the mix — a do-it-yourself version that consists of a box fan and a filter, taped together with painter's tape. The filter he used was not a HEPA, but a MERV-11 filter, which is cheaper and easier to find.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here. They did replace the logo everywhere inside the app, but how does their new app icon look like?</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51ed3fd0200eeffdc690d_revolut-app-icon.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>What next?</h2><p>There’s nothing bad in wanting your logo to look simpler, better, mobile-ready, or universal enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Shoot for simplicity and legibility, but keep your distinguishing features. Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>There is a very straightforward no BS way to measure the quality of your business idea research process.</p>
<p>When we do research we usually start with a hypothesis and then try to confirm or reject it.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that how we set up our hypothesis is usually shit.</p>
<p>We base our hypothesis on things we already know.
And to be honest, usually we don't know much about anything regarding the new business.</p>
<p>You would think that a better way would be to first gather more data by trying to learn more about things that we know we don't know well. It will give us a much better understanding of the field and we will be better at creating our hypothesis.</p>
<p>But we can do even better.</p>
<p>We can go and try to find as many things that we didn't even know are a thing.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p><strong>Measure every conversation based on how many completely new things you have learned that you didn't know existed before. Usually, this will open a completely new point of view that we couldn't have otherwise.</strong></p>
<p> This will give us more insight than simply validating our half-baked hypothesis.</p>
<p>I believe that even just learning one such thing per conversation is a a job well done.</p>
<p>How to do that and how to ask such questions? </p>
<p>I have no idea. </p>
<p>But I know a few things that might help.</p>

<p>Today hackers were able to briefly take over the <a href="https://google.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.lk</a> domain, the Google’s search engine page for Sri Lanka and redirect it to bring awareness to an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>To be clear the hackers did not took over the Google.lk domain by hacking Google servers, but the hackers were able to somehow modify the DNS settings either by poisoning the DNS of the ISPs, or changing the DNS setting of the ISPs that is linked to the Google.lk domain name.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://nic.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIC.lk</a> is responsible for maintaining the DNS settings for the .LK websites, .LK is the country specific domain on Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>And it seems for a brief period of time all the ping requests to Google.lk were redirected to an IP address maintained by Digital Ocean, probably an IP address that is linked to a droplet.</p>
<p><strong>The hackers were using this opportunity to bring awareness to an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka.</strong> </p>
<p>Sri Lanka is an exporter of one of the world’s finest tea (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_production_in_Sri_Lanka" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_production_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank">Ceylon Tea</a>), however estate workers who work on these estates only make a daily wage of around 4 USD.</p>
<p>The estate workers have been fighting to increase their daily wage to at least $5 for nearly half a decade, however, there is disagreement with the government and the estate owners in providing a daily minimum wage of $5 USD.</p>
<p>Protests are being carried out at estates around the country demanding the minimum wage to be raised to $5 USD per day. And for a brief moment, hackers were able to become activists on the internet.</p>
<h2>The page was titled <strong>“Is this really freedom?”</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Really Freedom?<br>Tea estate Workers’ lives dark as the tea kettle. Still, they are fighting for their 1000(approx 5$ per day) Rupess salary for the last several years. But 1000 Rupees also not enough at this time. Heartless politicians and the companies are not even agreeing to pay at least 1000 per day.</p><cite>Google.lk briefly displayed this on their webpage as hackers took over the domain name.</cite></blockquote>

<p>I’m sure the government will look into this, and we might be able to find out who did this, and how they did it in the coming days.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has to really think hard about their cyber security, even though startups tend to be more secure, the government websites and services are more hit and miss.</p>
<p>Back in November I was able to gain access to the now fixed COVID Tracking system. The developers fixed the vulnerability after I informed them about it.</p>

<p>You have to walk before you can run! Start your journey here in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/syntax">part 1</a>, where we'll learn the basics of Rust's syntax.</p>

<p>One of the things that distinguishes Rust from Haskell is the way it handles memory. Rust is meant to be more performant than Haskell, so it forces us to think more about memory while we're programming. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/memory">part 2</a> of the series, we'll see what this looks like.</p>

<p>Data types are one area where Rust borrows some great ideas from Haskell! Take a look at <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/data">part 3</a> to learn more!</p>

<p>Like any good language, Rust comes with a development toolchain for package management and dependency handling. Cargo is very much Rust's equivalent to Stack. And in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/cargo">part 4</a>, we'll see how to use it.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/lifetimes">fifth and final part</a> of this series, we'll explore a couple more topics that will round out your Rust eduction. We'll first see how to use collection types in Rust. Then we'll see some of the implications of Rust's memory model on these types. This will lead us to an exploration of the concept of lifetimes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it helps to see things in action, rather than just reading about them! In our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust-video-tutorial">Rust video tutorial</a>, we'll go through all the concepts from this series from scratch, starting with installation! You'll get to see specific examples, and what a general development flow looks like.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
<div>
    <main>
            <article>
    
    <div>
            <p>Lately I have been hanging out in Clubhouse to have interesting discussions about Tech, AI, Programming and other things. </p><p>It has been a great way to fill the silence of working from home listening to random Lo-Fi playlists that I started to really dislike. </p><p>Clubhouse is invite-only and iphone only at the moment, but it seems that a lot more users are joining the app, notoriously people like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>Needless to say that I love the application and I'm having a lot of fun using it. The following is not a guide but more a collection of things that I tried out to understand how someone would write an automated bot for the platform. I am not releasing any source code since I don't want to contribute to anything negative, so consider it a writeup from someone who likes to tinker with things. </p><p>Many users on the plattform have a second account in the form of a second phone they use to organize or moderate rooms while keeping their main account separated. I did not want to go down that route since "there must be a better way". </p><h2 id="finding-interesting-conversations">Finding interesting conversations</h2><p>The main thing that makes the app interesting is the different rooms that are available. A room is a virtual space people join to discuss different topics. The main way to find or discover new rooms is by following people that you like or people who discuss interesting things and then get recommendations from rooms they like or clubs they follow. A club is essentially a group of people, just like Facebook groups. </p><p>After some time, the room view gets bloated with uninteresting stuff that I'm not really into like "Learn to dream big by joining this bootcamp - as a millionaire" and other fake/conspiracy theory stuff. While I can see the appeal I don't want to have it suggested everytime. There are currently two ways to find rooms, the main view (aka suggested to you or "Upcoming for you") or the general view that lists all the discussions around the world ("Upcoming for All", &nbsp;very hard to navigate). </p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouseviews.PNG"><figcaption>App view</figcaption></figure><p>It is difficult to filter out through what I consider is fluff and find what is interesting to me. I don't want to be coached, I don't want to buy a course or whatever I just want to discuss or listen to interesting people that are not trying to sell me something. </p><p>There are also a LOT of rooms that people call "Silent networking" where they join and mainly follow each other recursively lol. These rooms are just for clout and absolutely useless, I hide them everytime but they keep coming back up. It's really like it sounds, rooms filled with people who just want to get their follower count up without having to put in any work or learn anything. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="oldest-trick-in-the-book">Oldest trick in the book</h2><p>Naturally something I grew very good in is automation and writing programs to automate whatever it is I am doing, from GUI's to apps to websites. Everything that can be automated should be automated is my mantra, it leaves time for life. </p><p>So what do you do in this case? </p><p>The first and natural option is to try to reverse engineer the app or in other words try to understand how it works and reproduce or automate those parts. In order to do that, one common way is to use a technique called "Man in the middle" which is essentially setting up a proxy on your phone to intercept the requests that the app is sending and then... modify them and send them again without all the finger tapping action!</p><p>Naturally, I began using <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> which is an excellent tool to do just that but it looked like Clubhouse is using certificate pinning. This means I cannot use my custom certificate to intercept the traffic. The app was throwing NSURLErrorDomain errors &nbsp;which implies just that. </p><p><a href="https://blog.netspi.com/four-ways-to-bypass-ios-ssl-verification-and-certificate-pinning/">There are MANY ways online to circumvent this</a>, the main one is to use a jailbroken iPhone with some other tools and bypass that custom certificate... I will not elaborate much on this one however but you can learn it with some youtube and reading some other blogs.</p><p>So, doing that you can find out things like how Clubhouse is built and what endpoints it is using, what authentication methods... </p><p>One main discovery is that Clubhouse is using a REST api at clubhouseapi.com for authentication, registration, searching rooms and co. It uses Agora (audio chat) and Pubnub (real-time communication) under the hood for all the audio related stuff. </p><p>Someone posted a <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuowei/ClubhouseAPI/main/doc/openapi.yaml#/default/get_get_all_topics">Swagger specification of the private Clubhouse API here</a> (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!):</p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouse-api.PNG"><figcaption>Clubhouse API</figcaption></figure><p>It is possible to get the Agora SDK to tinker around with things and get the audio after the token has been extracted. </p><p><a href="https://zerforschung.org/posts/gespraeche-aus-dem-clubhouse/">This guide/writeup (in German) explains how it is possible to do fancy stuff with the Agora</a> to listen into ANY room in Clubhouse and do whatever you want with the audio, which is nice I'd say. You just need the Token from the Clubhouse REST API.</p><p>So the point of the whole thing is this: </p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouse-list-rooms.PNG"><figcaption>Search all the relevant rooms using a keyword</figcaption></figure><p>Now I can list all the rooms that have a certain topic of interest in their title, get their ID and programmatically join them to listen! This is a fully automated clubhouse experience. &nbsp;</p><p>I am working on a dashboard of interesting Clubhouse rooms and events but it is currently personal until Clubhouse releases a public API that is legit to access. This was a fun 2 hour project to implement :) </p><p>If you want to get notified of new stuff just follow me on Clubhouse as well, you can find me under "Karim Jedda", same picture as here.</p><p>Enjoy, have a great weekend and stay healthy. </p><p>Note: I was asked to contact the Clubhouse dev if they knew this was possible since it also would allow listening into rooms while remaining anonymous... so I tweeted them and let's see, hope that gets fixed easy peasy :)</p>

<p>One of the quiet, grotesque, longrunning scandals of the US legal system is PACER, the paywall that separates the people of America from their court records. It's a hard drive of non-searchable PDFs, and it costs Americans $150m+/year to run.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/08/turkeys-for-christmas-party/#recap">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/08/turkeys-for-christmas-party/#recap</a></p>
<p>After decades of fights – including the stunt that put Aaron Swartz in the FBI's crosshairs – Congress is finally moving on the Open Courts Act, which makes substantial reforms to the PACER system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8235/text">https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8235/text</a></p>
<p>But as Carl Malamud – who has been a leader in the fight to free PACER – writes in an open letter to the bill's Congressional and Senate advocates, the Act doesn't go nearly far enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/regulations.gov.foia/uscourts.gov.20210204.pdf">https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/regulations.gov.foia/uscourts.gov.20210204.pdf</a></p>
<p>The law is free as in speech – in the public domain, owned by no one. PACER should be a system for distributing whole copies of all US law to anyone who wants to host them (and it should be free for anyone who wants to confirm a copy's veracity).</p>
<p>As Malamud points out, distributing copies of the PACER corpus takes some of the pressure off revisions to PACER itself. PACER is total flaming garbage and needs a complete overhaul. In recognition of this, the bill contemplates <em>five years</em> before major changes are due.</p>
<p>But distributing copies of PACER – a mere 1b documents, peanuts compared to other open access projects – would enable public interest orgs to immediately build their own PACER mirrors to serve different audiences and use-cases.</p>
<p>The letter has an impressive roster of signatories, from EFF legal director Corynne McSherry to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales to Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle to former CTOs of the USA, a former Chief Data Scientist of the USA, and more.</p>

<p>Aaron Epstein is a 90 year old who lives a couple miles from me in North Hollywood. He's been an AT&amp;T customer since 1960 and holy shit, is he ever <em>done with their shit</em>.</p>
<p>Epstein gets 3mbps (nominal)/1.5 mbps (actual) from AT&amp;T, in the heart of the entertainment industry's company town, where the studios are serviced by a 100gb fiber loop built at public expense (it passes under my house's foundation slab).</p>
<p>Like all of us in this part of LA, Epstein is not able to access this publicly funded fiber, because his city has given monopoly franchises to AT&amp;T and Charter, two of the most despicable monopoly companies in America.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Charter have absorbed billions – <em>billions</em> – in public subsidy to build out fast networks, and instead, they've gone on shopping sprees, buying up companies and running them into the ground, showering execs with money, and screwing over their workers.</p>
<p>Epstein took out quarter-page ads in the Manhattan and Dallas editions of the WSJ excoriating AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey (salary: $22.5m) for his failure to do literally the only thing anyone wants his company to do: provide fast broadband.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721">https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721</a></p>
<p>In Ars Technica, Jon Brodkin speaks with Epstein, who sounds like a really excellent fellow, about the many frustrations he faces in his home and business with broadband from the cable/DSL duopoly.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/</a></p>
<p>"Epstein said he pays AT&amp;T about $100 a month at home for two phone lines and Internet service and $49 a month to Charter for cable Internet. Epstein also pays AT&amp;T for phone and Internet service at a business he owns in Sherman Oaks."</p>
<p>And Brodkin found a spokesweasel from AT&amp;T to comment on Epstein's letter. The anonymous spox provided the following drivel for publication: "We continually enhance and invest in our wireless and wireline networks."</p>
<p>It turns out that Mr Epstein is a goddamned legend and hero. He's from an impressive lineage, part of the "Pickwick Books" Epsteins, a legendary Hollywood bookstore founded by Russian immigrant Louis Epstein in 1938:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-25-we-5692-story.html">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-25-we-5692-story.html</a></p>
<p>But Mr Epstein isn't just descended from greatness – he attained greatness in his own right. In 1999, he won a critical lawsuit that ended the corrupt practice of running Business Improvement Districts through "Property Owner Associations" not subject to sunshine laws.</p>
<p>The risible pretense that these were not local government bodies allowed BIDs to operate unaccountably, making significant changes to municipal policy under cover of darkness.</p>
<p><a href="https://michaelkohlhaas.org/wp/2014/10/30/no-one-shall-expel-us-from-the-paradise-epstein-has-created-for-us/">https://michaelkohlhaas.org/wp/2014/10/30/no-one-shall-expel-us-from-the-paradise-epstein-has-created-for-us/</a></p>
<p>Epstein sued the City of LA all the way to the Appellate Division, where the court actual mocked the City lawyers for their idiotic arguments, calling them the "The 'We Said We Didn’t "Create" the POA, So You Can’t Decide We Did'" gambit.</p>
<p>As Michael Kohlhaas wrote of the lawsuit, "Without Epstein’s pioneering work, BIDs wouldn’t have been known to be subject to the Brown Act and the California Public Records Act."</p>

<p>Amazon's Chicago DCH1 warehouse workers are pioneers of Amazon labor organizing. They met brutal treatment with walkouts, petitions and protests that wrung real concessions from Amazon, a company that pioneered worker brutality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/amazon-gives-part-time-warehouse-workers-paid-leave-amid-coronavirus.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/amazon-gives-part-time-warehouse-workers-paid-leave-amid-coronavirus.html</a></p>
<p>But now DCH1 is being made to suffer. The company has demanded that these workers knuckle under to a new scheduling system called "Megacycles," which is corporatespeak for a ten-hour shift that runs from 1:20AM to 11:50AM.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts</a></p>
<p>Workers that refuse the new schedule – because there is no transit option to get them to their job at that hour, because they are caring for elderly relatives, because they have kids in distance ed – will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>And while this schedule would be a burden to any worker, it's an especially vicious way to treat women workers, who are far more likely to be in caregiving roles at home, and who face extra safety risks associated with midnight travel to their shift.</p>
<p>Amazon claims the benefit of "megacycles" is efficiency – and if "efficiency" means "paying fewer workers to do more work for less money," then they're obviously right.</p>
<p>"Jen Crowcroft, a spokesperson for Amazon, told Motherboard that the transition to megacycle provides a longer window for customers to place orders and an improved station experience, and makes it easier for different delivery stations to work together."</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. And also, it means that workers have to abandon their kids and parents and the company of non-nocturnal humans and work 10 hours straight in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>A petition from DCH1 Amazonians United calls for all Amazon workers to receive a $2/h wage premium for working "megacycles," accommodations for caretakers to allow them to work fractional shifts, and free Lyft rides to and from work.</p>
<p>"The National Employment Law Project found in a 2020 report on workplaces injuries in Amazon warehouses is twice that of the national average for the warehouse industry. " -Lauren Kaori Gurley, Motherboard.</p>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> In a new paper, a team of EPFL spatial-analysis experts and neurologists from Geneva University Hospital (HUG) show that the probability of developing Parkinson's disease is higher in the canton of Geneva's urban centers than in its rural areas. This constitutes an important contribution to the study of the causes of this neurodegenerative disease, which are still poorly understood.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>Parkinson's disease, which progressively destroys certain types of brain neurons, affects some 15,000 people in Switzerland. It’s the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Its frequency increases with age and it tends to occur more frequently in men. Although the cause is still largely unknown, scientists agree that in most cases a combination of hereditary and environmental factors play a role.</p><p>By studying the geographic distribution of Parkinson's patients in a given area, scientists can identify clusters of higher or lower prevalence and, based on this, extrapolate potential environmental risk factors. In 2018, <a href="https://www.hug.ch/neurologie">HUG neurologists</a> Pierre Burkhard and Vanessa Fleury carried out Switzerland’s first assessment of the incidence of Parkinson's disease, in the canton of Geneva. They used their findings to compile an anonymized database of Parkinson's patients. “Prof. Burkhard had noticed that several of his patients lived close together, and thought there might be localized clusters of the disease in the canton. Then I worked with him to find a way to scientifically substantiate his hypothesis,” says Fleury.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Are there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?</p></blockquote><p>Fleury&nbsp;met with Dr. Stéphane Joost and his student Rebecca Himsl, after being put in touch by the <a href="https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/unite-epidemiologie-populationnelle-uep">Population Epidemiology Unit at HUG </a>and&nbsp;Prof. Idris Guessous – a long-time research partner of EPFL's <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasig/">Geographic Information Systems Laboratory (LASIG)</a>. Himsl subsequently selected this topic for her Master's project. Bringing clinicians and spatial-analysis experts together on a cross-disciplinary team proved to be highly effective. “We looked at the situation from an epidemiological point of view and asked: Are there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?” says Himsl, now a flood-risk analyst for a Canadian company. The results of the study were published in&nbsp;<em>Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders</em>&nbsp;on 1 February.</p><p><strong>New perspectives</strong></p><p>The study's findings are enlightening, above all in terms of the methodology used, which puts forth a new approach to environmental epidemiology research. The team linked environmental and epidemiological data regarding the age, gender and address of the canton's 1,115 Parkinson's disease patients, and drew up detailed maps of case distribution based on specific environmental exposure factors. To create a control group, they incorporated data on 12,614 Geneva residents collected by the Population Epidemiology Unit's Health Bus between 1995 and 2014. This approach based on individual cases differs from the more conventional method of aggregating data, which can be less accurate for detecting highly localized areas of disease prevalence.</p><div><figure><img alt="" height="471" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/b6/e1/192abba7.jpg" width="622"><figcaption>Distribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots (red points) and coldspots (blue points) in the canton of Geneva&nbsp;© LASIG</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>“A very complex set of causes”</strong></p><p>“We geolocated patient groups taking into account known confounding factors such as age and gender. This allowed us to pinpoint local hotspots with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Such spatial dependence concerns a small percentage of patients (6%), but remains statistically significant even after all factors that could contribute to Parkinson's disease have been eliminated,” Himsl explains. Her findings, generated in part by a probability model, also make it possible to identify “coldspots” – areas where fewer people than average are affected by Parkinson's disease.</p><blockquote><p>It's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor</p></blockquote><p>The study shows that most Parkinson's hotspots are located close to downtown Geneva, in contrast to coldspots, which are situated on the outskirts. “There is a significant positive correlation between these hotspots and the degree of air pollution, which leads us to suspect that there is a link between Parkinson's and atmospheric pollution. Our study highlights two key facts: the multifactorial nature of Parkinson's disease, and the importance of improving air quality to prevent the disease,” explains Fleury. Joost adds: “It's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor, as we did here, which is very likely air pollution.”</p><div><figure><img alt="" height="472" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/db/77/4412fccc.jpg" width="622"><figcaption>Distribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots and coldspots in the canton of Geneva, associated with air pollution. © LASIG</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Matching results – with two exceptions</strong></p><p>When Joost picked up Himsl’s work after she graduated, he incorporated data recently made available by the Greater Geneva agglomeration concerning concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter. He then superimposed these data on Himsl’s maps and saw that they matched up across all the hotspots – except for the Eaux-Vives district near the city center, where air quality seems to be better, and the Les Délices coldspot, which shows high levels of nitrogen dioxide. “We will now try to identify one or more possible explanatory factors and publish them in a new paper,” says Joost, who already posits that a confluence of positive factors close to home may reduce the risk of developing the disease.</p><p>“Thanks to the areas of prevalence that the study identified, it could be of use to healthcare providers,” says Joost. “We have shown that there is a greater likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease in certain types of neighborhoods, which could lead policymakers to introduce measures to protect residents or improve facilities in these communities. Our findings will also help the HUG neurologists we worked with, who can now focus on looking for other factors that explain the onset of this disease.”</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Feb 5, 2021</p>




<p>With the events that
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/26/iran-blocks-signal-messaging-app-after-whatsapp-exodus">the private messaging app Signal has been blocked in Iran</a>,
Signal has come up with an “proxy” solution akin to
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>’s
<a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/">Bridges</a>, and have given
instructions on how to do it.</p>
<p>For people who prefer FreeBSD over Linux like myself, we obviously can’t run
Docker, which is what Signal’s instructions focus on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Docker image is just a fancy wrapper around nginx,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ahfaeroey/status/1357878573785362437">and the configs can be ported to any OS</a>.
Here, I’ll show you how to set up a Signal Proxy on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>You will need a FreeBSD server that is not running anything on Port 80 or 443.
If you don’t run FreeBSD, you can substitute the commands with ones specific to
your OS or Linux distro.</p>
<p>You can also substitute <code>acme.sh</code> with another ACME-compatible Let’s Encrypt
client, or use another CA. I used <code>acme.sh</code> with ZeroSSL, but won’t describe
the latter here for simplicity’s sake.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to install <code>acme.sh</code> and <code>nginx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pkg install acme.sh nginx
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you’ll need to get an SSL certificate:</p>
<pre><code>acme.sh --register-account -m neel@neelc.org --server zerossl
acme.sh --issue --standalone -d DOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>DOMAIN</code> with the hostname you want to use.</p>
<p>Next, use the following config for <code>/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>load_module /usr/local/libexec/nginx/ngx_stream_module.so;
user www;

events {}

    server {
        listen                443 ssl;

    server {
        listen                4433;
        proxy_pass            $name;
        ssl_preread           on;
        error_log             /dev/null;
        access_log            off;
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again replace <code>DOMAIN</code> with the domain your Signal proxy is on.</p>
<p>After you have set the <code>nginx</code> config, enable it via sysrc:</p>
<pre><code>sysrc nginx_enable=YES
</code></pre>
<p>And start it:</p>
<pre><code>service nginx start
</code></pre>
<p>You should have a fully-functioning Signal proxy.</p>

<p>While the official Signal instructions are very Docker-centric for the tech
part, it does have other useful information on sharing the proxy securely.
This means I won’t duplicate the information here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

                    The path to World War Two originated from unresolved territorial issues between France and Germany at the end of World War One. These, coupled with economic and social upheaval in Germany and Italy, old colonial ambitions and a desire for conquest led by Hitler and Mussolini resulted in the second world war.

                                <p>World War I was over. The united forces of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States of America - the Entente - defeated the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire - the Central Powers.</p>

The peace treaty was recorded by the Secretary of the League of Nations and printed amongst the treaties of the League of Nations.</p>

            <h3>The End of World War One and the Paris Peace Conference</h3>

            <p>
                                    World War I was the most terrifying carnage humanity had ever known. At the end of the 52 months of war, the statistics were shattering: over 9 million lives lost, with probably the same number of people suffering from some kind of illness or disability after the battles.

            <h3>Hitler’s Rise to Power</h3>

            <p>
                                    After his unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of the province of Bavaria, Hitler was imprisoned. In prison, he wrote his autobiographical book Mein Kampf, ‘My Struggle’. Mein Kampf was the reference work for the entire Nazi ideology. It was the inspiration which ‘justified’ Germany’s expansion and its entire genocidal policy.

            <h3>Nazi Germany</h3>

            <p>
                                    Once Hitler had taken over Germany’s destiny, foreign policy turned towards destroying the diplomatic edifice of the Treaty of Versailles, which many Germans saw as a humiliating ‘Diktat’. The occupation of the demilitarized area of the Rhineland was a definitive failure of the collective security. It opened up the way for the Second World War.

            <h3>Blitzkrieg</h3>

            <p>
                                    Blitzkrieg literally means ‘lightning war’. This tactic describes an offensive military doctrine used by the German Army during World War Two.

            <h3>Japan on the Path to World War Two</h3>

            <p>
                                    The path that led Japan on one side, and the United States, China and Britain on the other to war is long and complex. The origins of the conflict can be identified in Japan's unique history and culture, nurtured by the expansionist tendencies of its leaders in the 1930's.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/">Part 4 </a>I continued the repairs and donated the money from the first batch of the repaired Pis to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. <br></p>



<p>In this post I will be covering what the money went towards and go over the current repair status.</p>



<blockquote><p>I’ve confirmed that your donation has been allocated to Pi Drop. It should fund approximately three deployments of Pi 400+monitor+webcam to disadvantaged young people in the UK. Thanks again for the donation (and for putting more Pi 1 units back in the field).</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The money donated so far has funded three computers for disadvantaged young people that require a computer to learn from home. Whilst this might not seem like a lot from selling 27 Raspberry Pi 1’s please keep in mind this includes a Raspberry Pi 400 or a Raspberry Pi 4 with keyboard, mouse, monitor and SD card. </p>



<p>In terms of continuing the repairs and donations I have a goal in my head that I would like to meet and I will be listing a further 30 repaired  Model B’s for sale today!</p>



<p>I will also be listing 10 “Model A’s” – More about these below.</p>



<h2>Salvaging dead Pis by removing components</h2>



<p>I came across a fair amount of Pis with dead Ethernet and/or dead USB ports. This issue was caused by a failed Ethernet IC.</p>



<p>Eben Upton did offer to see if they had any spare Ethernet IC’s for the Pi 1. I could have used them to restore full functionality to these devices however I had already started converting them to Model As and the chance of spare IC’s for such an old device laying around seemed slim. </p>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;was thinking perhaps we might have some 9512 chips lying around, but it’s been so long since we transitioned to 9514 that we almost certainly don’t.</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead I removed the Ethernet IC and associated circuitry – More of this can be seen in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>I have completed 10 of these so far and they will also be listed for sale today! </p>



<p>These devices are almost identical to the original Model A with the missing Ethernet port, IC and top USB port. <br></p>

<p>Some of these boards might have residual flux left over from the repairs although I have cleaned them up as best as I can! </p>



<p>They also have a mixture of 256MB and 512MB of RAM meaning some of them are an upgrade over the original model A!</p>



<h2>Replacing damaged SD card slots</h2>



<p>I already went over this in<a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/"> part 4</a> however I’m further along with the repairs. 30 of these have been repaired in total so far and I also re-enforced the slots with a small amount of Epoxy Resin to stop them being snapped from the board. <br></p>

<p>Please keep in mind when purchasing these – Not all of the Pi’s listed for sale today will include a new SD card slot. Some of the Pis literally had the SD card slots ripped off damaging the pads and a small amount of the devices have had trace wires added to the board to repair the missing pads. These are small and almost unnoticeable but please keep this in mind! </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>These devices are now listed for sale – as with the last batch the Model Bs will be sold in pairs with one device having been repaired previously and the other working but not repaired. Although both devices have been tested and proved to work I will only guarantee one of the Pis. </p><p>Model Bs x2 for £15: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-b-x2/274673808835</p><p>Model As x1 for £7: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-A/274673810787</p><p>All money raised from these will be donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>If you have any thoughts on this please let me know below! </p></div>

<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">xkcd sourc</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/974/" target="_blank">e</a></p>



<p>This post began as a response to a teacher who posted in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/673921113090580">Unity Teach Community</a> Facebook group that he had been advised by college video game teacher that object oriented programming (OOP) is a key skill needed for success in collegiate video game programming.</p>



<p>OOP was, in part, a reaction to increasingly larger code bases and increasingly more programmers on projects. Creating OOP can feel unnecessarily verbose for small programs (it often is). Using OOP can often feel like calling magic functions that do things with no understanding of what is happening or how it is happening. I’m brand new to Unity, but already seeing this problem. If the goal is to create video games, no worries, if the goal is to educate students on how OOP works, there might be some concern.</p>



<p>OOP can be tough to crack because the term has conflated a lot of different concepts and taken on somewhat of a religious tone in certain circles. Let me try to break down the different meanings.</p>



<p>OOP is sometimes and incorrectly conflated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured Programming</a>. Structured Programming is ReallyGood&lt;tm&gt; stuff and is easier to learn with a pure (read not OOP) procedural language. It is, however, quite possible to write structured code in an OOP language where you end up with procedural Java or C# or C++. This aspect of the definition is often just assumed, though, and rarely explicitly discussed.</p>



<p>OOP also has the concept of data hiding sometimes referred to as “black boxes”. This is one step beyond Structured Programming in that you build black boxes that take input and produce output and the programmer using the boxes do not need to know what is going on inside. This is a wonderful thing and it allows programmers to use libraries without having the slightest clue of how they internally work. There is, however, overhead (both code performance and increased coding time) in creating libraries this way and there is a very real argument that merely teaching students to <em>use</em> black boxes is to short change them on the ability to <em>create </em>them.</p>



<p>Next we have inheritance which is a very abused but very powerful concept that is especially powerful in video game programming.  Imagine you have a sprite. It can go up, down, left, right. It has an image associated with it. Now you want to create a tank in your game. Tanks can do everything a sprite can do <em>and</em> more, say shoot another sprite as a projectile. So you inherit all the things a sprite can do, don’t have to recreate that particular wheel, and add only the new things the tank is and does.</p>



<p>Mind blowingly powerful when used correctly in video game programming and other programming fields. Painful when twisted for unsuited uses.</p>



<p>Lastly, OOP is about data protection aka public and private (and protected and a few other things better left for another time). This is related to the concept of black boxes. Data protection provides the opaqueness that is needed to protect the inside of the boxes from the outside world.</p>



<p>It would be nice to just be able to set the rules for libraries in a procedural programming language and tell the other programmers “use this, don’t use that, assume this, don’t assume that”. Reality is programmers rarely follow those rules and history is rife with programmers taking advantage of “undocumented features”. So OOP actually allows you to <em>enforce </em>some set of the rules on programmers. Some things are public, fair game for any use by anyone, some things are private, that is inside the black box and, even if you can figure out how it works, you can’t directly access it.</p>



<p>I’ll add that there is a more pure definition OOP coming out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">SmallTalk </a>world, primarily, where the entire goal is to pass messages from one object to another to enforce some of the above. This is largely a theoretical approach and isn’t so consistent with modern Java, C++, C# and the like. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210">Objective C</a> was somewhat in this vein. Honestly, Objective C just gave me a headache.</p>



<p>Learning or teaching OOP can be made much easier by breaking each of the above parts into separate components as one tends to be overwhelmed by all the concepts that get thrown around. With all that said, to loop around to the beginning, OOP is a tool and sometimes a very useful tool (especially in video game programming) but it is a screwdriver and doesn’t help so much driving nails.</p>

<p>Historical analogies are a way for us to find our footing. Psychologists regard them as a key plank in the learning process. ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,’ they say. So it’s no surprise that the coronavirus crisis draws comparison with a range of historic events.</p>



<p><strong>The disease itself has been compared with the flu pandemic of 1918.</strong> Although there have been other flu pandemics since, the ‘Spanish flu’ of 1918 is known for its heavy death toll of 20-50 million. Like all analogies there are differences and a stand-out one here is that the 1918 flu targeted the young, while coronavirus seems to target the old. That it was, oddly, largely forgotten as a historical event is a feature that also doesn’t seem to resonate given the way life is being experienced under coronavirus.</p>



<p><strong>The public response has been compared with the Second World War.</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8150155/Virus-causes-surge-WW-II-references-merited.html" target="_blank">Angela Merkel said (on 18 March)</a>, “Since the Second World War, there has been no challenge to our nation that has demanded such a degree of common and united action.” Meanwhile, in the UK, commentators have summoned the spirit of the Blitz to ease the burden from social restrictions. Of course, this time both nations are fighting a common enemy. And <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london/story-behind-keep-calm-and-carry" target="_blank"><em>Keep Calm and Carry On</em> is being used a lot more now than it was back then</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The suddenness is being compared with 9/11.</strong> Worldviews changed that day, just as they may be changing again. 9/11 heralded a fear of terror on a scale never before confronted. Like today’s virus, the terror did not discriminate. It is hard to believe that eight weeks ago the stock market was making new highs and the prospect that the state could legislate against basic human freedoms to the extent it has was ridiculous. In the space of a few weeks travel restrictions escalated from a few flights being cancelled from ‘high risk’ places like Beijing and Northern Italy, to flights being cancelled because demand for non-essential travel collapsed, to flights being cancelled because countries literally closed their borders.</p>



<p><strong>From an economic perspective, the analogy is the global financial crisis of 2008.</strong> Company finances are being ravaged and monetary authorities are rolling out many of the packages to ease strains in the financial system that they moth-balled after the 2008/09 financial crisis. In fact, the CEO of Marriott International, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SprFgoU6aO0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arne Sorenson, went as far as to say</a> on 20 March that “Covid-19 is having a more severe and sudden financial impact on our business than 9/11 and the 2009 financial crisis combined.” On Thursday 26 March, US jobless claims jumped to 3.28 million, four times the prior peak in records that have been compiled since 1967. JPMorgan economists expect US GDP to be down 40% in 2Q with unemployment hitting 20%.</p>



<p>Other analogies abound. The Great Depression of the 1930’s; natural disasters; and Prohibition – which amputated from the economy an entire industry in the way that industries such as hospitality are being poleaxed today.</p>



<p><strong>Of them all, the financial crisis of 2008 seems to offer the best framework. But not for its steer on the economic fallout, rather for the spotlight it shines on our understanding of the virus itself.</strong></p>



<h2>Mark to Market</h2>



<p>One of the challenges in the early stages of the financial crisis was dimensioning the losses that were building. No-one knew how big they were, nor where they were. <a href="https://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report</a> recalls that in early 2007 “Goldman marked mortgage-related securities at prices that were significantly lower than those of other companies.” The divergence came to a head in April 2007 when Goldman valued a Bear Stearns hedge fund’s positions at between 65 cents and 100 cents on the dollar. A few weeks later it revalued the positions, going as low as 55 cents on the dollar. Ralph Cioffi, the manager of the Bear Stearns fund, resisted. He proposed using fair value marks based on his team’s models, implying losses that were significantly less than those using Goldman’s marks.</p>



<p>The different approach to marks back then is reflected in the different approach to testing today. On 1 March Nassim Taleb tweeted this. His point was that the “losses” were by then endemic; it was just that some countries were measuring them more accurately than others.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a marked-to-market problem.<br>Low incidence = low testing.</p><p>Only places that mark to market properly seem to be Singapore and Bella Italia. <a href="https://t.co/seSrdFy3X8">pic.twitter.com/seSrdFy3X8</a></p></div>— Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1233927807845183490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Several weeks later the lack of wholesale testing still makes it difficult to dimension the true scale of the problem. By now it is apparent that the number of confirmed cases (2 million globally at the time of writing) is not a valid reflection of the number of actual cases. But how many actual cases there are remains unknown.</p>



<ul><li>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">Imperial College study</a> estimates that 4.04% of the UK population has been infected as at 14 April (with 95% confidence between 2.87% and 5.67%).</li></ul>



<ul><li>The UK based <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html" target="_blank">Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a> estimates that 3.6% of symptomatic cases in the UK were reflected in official reported numbers as of 14 April (with 95% confidence between 3.1% and 7.7%).</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/less-than-1-of-austria-infected-with-coronavirus-new-study-shows#maincontent" target="_blank">A survey of 1,500 people in Austria</a> found that 0.33% were “acutely infected” at the beginning of April (with 95% confidence between 0.12% and 0.76%).</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-small-nations-iceland-big-data/2959797001/" target="_blank">Iceland’s small population</a> and developed healthcare system has allowed it to test more of its population than any other nation. By 11 April it had tested 10% of its population with results implying that between 0.3% and 0.8% of the country could be infected.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo" target="_blank">In Italy all the residents of the small town of Vò were tested</a> in the two weeks leading up to 20 March. The process found that at the time of the first symptomatic case some 3% of the population had already been infected.</li></ul>



<p>Like with the Bear Stearns hedge funds over a decade ago, some countries are also incentivised to under-represent their caseload. One example is Japan, where the number of confirmed cases began to ramp up immediately after the Tokyo Olympics had been officially postponed, leading some to speculate the number had been artificially suppressed. China too was criticised for under-reporting the severity of the disease when it first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019.</p>



<h2>Mark to Model</h2>



<p><strong>As well as questioning the validity of valuations being employed, the financial crisis also exposed flaws in the models used to underpin various financial structures. </strong>“Financial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models as reliable predictors of risks, replacing judgment in too many instances. Too often, risk management became risk justification.” (<a href="https://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report</a>).</p>



<p>Right now, policy is being steered by a range of epidemiology models that are being used to predict the spread of the virus. The problem with these models – as with all models, including those used on Wall Street in 2007/08 – is that they are only as good as the assumptions they rest on. “All models are wrong,” said statistician George Box, (“but some are useful.”) When it comes to epidemiological models there is a broad range of uncertainty around many of the inputs.</p>



<p>That uncertainty can be categorised in three buckets.</p>



<p><strong>The first covers the quality of the data,</strong> such as the number of people infected. As outlined above, this remains a key unknown. Some models use statistical techniques to infer total infections, such as the one from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html" target="_blank">Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a> which extrapolates from fatalities; others use sampling such as in Iceland. Even the hardest variable of all – fatalities – is subject to uncertainty. The UK’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#number-of-cases-and-deaths" target="_blank">Department of Health and Social Care (DHSE)</a> reports daily the number of people who died in hospital before 5pm the previous day. But what about those who didn’t die in hospital, but died in care homes or at home? (My neighbour was allowed home from hospital to die – where does he appear in the DHSE dataset?) And what about those who died anyway from other causes – those who died <em>with</em> Covid rather than <em>from</em> Covid (like a friend’s father)? There is also typically a lag between when the death occurs and when it is recorded in the data – incurred but not reported is the jargon used in the insurance industry. If that lag is consistent it may not impact the output of the model much, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/longevitymatt/status/1247449180165017601" target="_blank">any change to the lag can skew resulting projections materially</a>.</p>



<p>The amount of data being generated through this crisis is immense. Unlike in 1918 when ‘20-50 million’ died, by the time this is over we will know <em>precisely</em> how many died. But it may take hindsight to discern the signal from the noise. When I look back at my notes from the financial crisis, there were a lot of datapoints that were fleetingly useful yet turned into dead ends.</p>



<p>Data quality is further compromised when comparing between countries. Datasets between countries are not really compatible with each other, yet with every political system on the planet confronted with a common challenge, there is a tendency for commentators to compare responses. While the overall shape of the spread looks similar, mortality rates remain stubbornly different. There are many explanations include healthcare capacity, population density, global connectedness, prevalence of underlying conditions like obesity, lockdown initiation, and demographics.

<p>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Planned legislation to establish new business areas in Nevada would allow technology companies to effectively form separate local governments.</p>

<p>Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced a plan to launch so-called Innovation Zones in Nevada to jumpstart the state’s economy by attracting technology firms, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported  Wednesday.</p>

<p>The zones would permit companies with large areas of land to form governments carrying the same authority as counties, including the ability to impose taxes, form school districts and courts and provide government services.</p>


<p>The measure to further economic development with the “alternative form of local government” has not yet been introduced in the Legislature.</p>

<p>Sisolak pitched the concept in his State of the State address delivered Jan. 19. The plan would bring in new businesses at the forefront of “groundbreaking technologies” without the use of tax abatements or other publicly funded incentive packages that previously helped Nevada attract companies like Tesla Inc.</p>


<p>Sisolak named Blockchains, LLC as a company that had committed to developing a “smart city” in an area east of Reno after the legislation has passed.</p>


<p>The draft proposal said the traditional local government model is “inadequate alone” to provide the resources to make Nevada a leader in attracting and retaining businesses and fostering economic development in emerging technologies and industries.</p>

<p>The Governor’s Office of Economic Development would oversee applications for the zones, which would be limited to companies working in specific business areas including blockchain, autonomous technology, the Internet of Things, robotics, artificial intelligence, wireless, biometrics and renewable resource technology.</p>


<p>Zone requirements would include applicants owning at least 78 square miles (202 square kilometers) of undeveloped, uninhabited land within a single county but separate from any city, town or tax increment area. Companies would have at least $250 million and plans to invest an additional $1 billion in their zones over 10 years.</p>

<p>The zones would initially operate with the oversight of their location counties, but would eventually take over county duties and become independent governmental bodies.</p>

<p>The zones would have three-member supervisor boards with the same powers as county commissioners. The businesses would maintain significant control over board membership.</p>

<p>The governor’s economic development office did not respond to questions about the zones Wednesday.</p>

      <p>What is said to be the 'smallest reptile on earth' - that we know of - has been discovered in Madagascar. The reptile, which is a subspecies of the chameleon, is the size of a seed.</p>
<p>With a body size of 13.5mm, the male version of the aptly named 'micro-chameleon' (or Brookesia nana), was discovered by a German-Madagascan expedition. The size from head to toe is 22mm.</p>
<p>Along with the male, a female was also discovered which is considerably bigger than her mate, at 29mm.</p>
<p>The discovery makes the male the smallest of about 11,500 known species of reptiles, according to the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich.</p>

        <article>
    
    <section id="post-title">
    
    <p>How I am using 50+ sources of my personal data
    </p></section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section id="post-content">
    <p>
This is the list of personal data sources I use or planning to use with rough guides on how to get your hands on that data if you want it as well.
It's still incomplete and I'm going to update it regularly.
</p>
<p>
My goal is collecting almost all of my digital trace, <b>automating data collection to the maximum extent possible</b> and making it work in the background, so one can set up pipelines once and hopefully never think about it again.
</p>
<p>
This is kind of a follow-up on my previous post on the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html">sad state of personal data</a>, and part of my personal way of getting around this sad state.
</p>
<p>
If you're terrified by the long list, you can jump straight into <a href="#consumers">"Data consumers"</a> section to find out how I use it.
In addition, check out <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html">my infrastructure map</a>, which might explain it better!
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="why"><a href="#why">¶</a><span>1</span> Why do you collect X? How do you use your data?</h2>
<div>
<p>
All things considered, I think it's a fair question!
Why bother with all this <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a> and hoard the data if you never use it?
</p>
<p>
In the next section, I will elaborate on each specific data source, but to start with I'll list the rationales that all of them share:
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="backup"><a href="#backup">¶</a>backup</h3>
<p>
It may feel unnecessary, but shit happens. What if your device dies, account gets suspended for some reason or the company goes bust?
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="lifelogging"><a href="#lifelogging">¶</a><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
Most data in digital form got timestamps, so automatically, without manual effort, constitutes data for your timeline.
</p>
<p>
I want to remember more, be able to review my past and bring back and reflect on memories. Practicing lifelogging helps with that.
</p>
<p>
It feels very wrong that things can be forgotten and lost forever.
It's understandable from the neuroscience point of view, i.e. the brain has limited capacity and it would be too distracting to remember everything all the time.
That said, I want to have a <b>choice</b> whether to forget or remember events, and I'd like to be able to potentially access forgotten ones.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="qs"><a href="#qs">¶</a><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#quantifiedself">quantified self</a></h3>
<p>
Most collected digital data is somewhat quantitative and can be used to analyze your body or mind.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what"><a href="#what">¶</a><span>2</span> What do I collect/want to collect?</h2>
<div>
<p>
As I mentioned, most of the collected data serve as a means of backup/lifelogging/quantified self, so I won't mention them again in the 'Why' sections.
</p>
<p>
All my data collection pipelines are <b>automatic unless mentioned otherwise</b>.
</p>
<p>
Some scripts are still private so if you want to know more, let me know so I can prioritize sharing them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="arbtt"><a href="#arbtt">¶</a>Arbtt (desktop time tracker)</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: <a href="https://arbtt.nomeata.de/">arbtt-capture</a>
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>haven't used it yet, but it could be a rich source of lifelogging context</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="bitbucket"><a href="#bitbucket">¶</a>Bitbucket (repositories)</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: <a href="https://github.com/samkuehn/bitbucket-backup">samkuehn/bitbucket-backup</a>
</p>
<p>
Why: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
proved especially useful considering Atlassian is going to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket"><b>wipe</b></a> mercurial repositories
</p>
<p>
I've got lots of private mercurial repositories with university homework and other early projects, and it's sad to think of people who will lose theirs during this wipe.

<h3 id="bluemaestro"><a href="#bluemaestro">¶</a><a href="https://bluemaestro.com/products/product-details/bluetooth-environmental-monitor-and-logger">Bluemaestro</a> (environment sensor)</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: sensor syncs with phone app via Bluetooth, <samp>/data/data/com.bluemaestro.tempo_utility/databases/</samp> is regularly copied to grab the data.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature during sleep data for the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
<li><p>
lifelogging: capturing weather conditions information
</p>
<p>
E.g. I can potentially see temperature/humidity readings along with my photos from hiking or skiing.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="blood"><a href="#blood">¶</a>Blood</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: via <a href="https://thriva.co/">thriva</a>, data imported manually into an org-mode table (not doing too frequently so wasn't worth automated scraping)
</p>
<p>
Also tracked glucose and ketones (with <a href="https://freestylediabetes.co.uk/freestyle-libre">freestyle libre</a>) for a few days out of curiosity, also didn't bother automating it.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>contributes to the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a>, could be a good way of establishing your baselines</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="emfit"><a href="#emfit">¶</a><a href="https://shop-eu.emfit.com/products/emfit-qs">Emfit QS</a> (sleep tracker)</h3>
<div>
<p>
Emfit QS is kind of a medical grade sleep tracker. It's more expensive than wristband ones (e.g. <a href="#fitbit">fitbit</a>, <a href="#jawbone">jawbone</a>) but also more reliable and gives more data.
</p>
<p>
How: <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/backup-emfit">emfitexport</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sleep data for the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="facebook"><a href="#facebook">¶</a>Facebook</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: manual archive export.
</p>
<p>
I barely use Facebook, so don't even bother doing it regularly.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<h3 id="fitbit"><a href="#fitbit">¶</a>Fitbit</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: manual CSV export, as I only used it for few weeks. Then the sync stopped working and I had to return it.
However, it seems <a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/intraday-requests">possible</a> via API.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>activity data for the <a href="#dashboard">#dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="foursquare"><a href="#foursquare">¶</a>Foursquare/Swarm</h3>
<p>
How: via API
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="github_repos"><a href="#github_repos">¶</a>Github (repositories)</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: <a href="https://github.com/josegonzalez/python-github-backup">github-backup</a>
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>capable of exporting starred repositories as well, so if the authors delete them I will still have them</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<h3 id="takeout"><a href="#takeout">¶</a>Google takeout</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: semi-automatic. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>only manual step: enable scheduled exports (you can schedule 6 per year at a time), and choose to keep it on Google Drive in export settings</li>
<li>mount your Google Drive (e.g. via <a href="https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse">google-drive-ocamlfuse</a>)</li>
<li>keep a script that checks mounted Google Drive for fresh takeout and moves it somewhere safe</li>
</ul>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Google collects lots of data, which you could put to some good use. However, old data is getting <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/takeout-data-gone.html">wiped</a>, so it's important to export Takeout regularly.</li>
<li><a href="#promnesia">better browsing history</a></li>
<li>(potentially) search history for <a href="#promnesia">promnesia</a></li>
<li><a href="#search">search</a> in youtube watch history</li>
<li>location data for lifelogging and the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a> (activity)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="hackernews"><a href="#hackernews">¶</a><span>STRT</span>Hackernews</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: haven't got to it yet. It's going to require:
</p>
<ul>
<li>extracting upvotes/saved items via web scraping since Hackernews doesn't offer an API for that. Hopefully, there is an existing library for that.</li>
<li><p>
I'm also using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.hidroh.materialistic">Materialistic</a> app that has its own 'saved' posts and doesn't synchronize with Hackernews. 
</p>
<p>
Exporting them is going to require copying the database directly from the app private storage.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Why: same reasons as <a href="#reddit">Reddit</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="hsbc"><a href="#hsbc">¶</a>HSBC bank</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: manual exports of monthly PDFs with transactions. They don't really offer API, so unless you want to web scrape and deal with 2FA, it seems it's the best you can do.
</p>
<p>
Why
</p>
<ul>
<li>personal finance; used it with <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/hsbc-parser">karlicoss/hsbc-parser</a> to feed into <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3 id="jawbone"><a href="#jawbone">¶</a>Jawbone</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: via API.
Jawbone is dead now, so if you haven't exported it already, likely your data is lost forever.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sleep data for the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="kindle"><a href="#kindle">¶</a>Kindle</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: manually exported <samp>MyClippings.txt</samp> from Kindle. Potentially can be automated similarly to <a href="#kobo">Kobo</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#search">better search</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<h3 id="nomie"><a href="#nomie">¶</a><a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
How: regular copies of <samp>/data/data/io.nomie.pro/files/_pouch_events</samp> and <samp>/data/data/io.nomie.pro/files/_pouch_trackers</samp>
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>could be a great tool for detailed lifelogging if you're into it</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="nutrition"><a href="#nutrition">¶</a>Nutrition</h3>
<div>
<p>
I tracked almost all nutrition data for stuff I ingested over the course of a year.
</p>
<p>
How: I found most existing apps/projects clumsy and unsatisfactory, so I developed my own system.
Not even a proper app, something simpler, basically a domain-specific language in Python to track it.
</p>
<p>
Tracking process was simply editing a python file and adding entries like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>
<span>july_09</span> = F(
  [  
       spinach * bag,
       tuna_spring_water * can,       
       beans_broad_wt    * can * 0.5, 
       onion_red_tsc     * gr(115)  , 
       cheese_salad_tsc  * 100,       
       lime, 
  ],
  [
     
  ],
  tea_black * 10,     
  wine_red * ml * 150, 
)

<span>july_10</span> = ... 
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Comments added for clarity of course, so it'd be more compact normally.
</p>
<p>
Then some code was used for processing, calculating, <a href="https://postimg.cc/bdSVc43Y">visualizing</a>, etc.
</p>
<p>
Having a real programming language instead of an app let me make it very flexible and expressive, e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I could define composite dishes as Python objects, and then easily reuse them.
</p>
<p>
E.g. if I made four servings of soup on 10.08.2018, ate one immediately and froze other three I would define something like <samp>soup_20180810 = [...]</samp>, and then I can simply reuse <samp>soup_20180810</samp> when I eat it again.
(date was easy to find out as I label food when put it in the freezer anyway)
</p></li>
<li>I could make many things implicit, making it pretty expressive without spending time on unnecessary typing</li>
<li>I rarely had to in nutrient composition manually, I just pasted the product link to supermarket website and had an automatic script to parse nutrient information</li>
<li>For micronutrients (that usually aren't listed on labels) I used the <a href="https://github.com/alyssaq/usda-sqlite">USDA sqlite database</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The hard thing was actually not entering, but rather not having nutrition information if you're eating out. That year I was mostly cooking my own food, so tracking was fairly easy.
</p>
<p>
Also I was more interested in lower bounds, (e.g. "do I consume at least recommended amount of micronutrients"), so not having logged food now and then was fine for me.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I mostly wanted to learn about food composition and how it relates to my diet, and I did
</p>
<p>
That logging motivated me to learn about different foods and try them out while keeping dishes balanced.
I cooked so many different things, made my diet way more varied and became less picky.
</p>
<p>
I stopped because cooking did take some time and I actually realized that as long as I actually vary
food and try to eat everything now and then, I hit all recommended amounts of micronutrients, so I stopped.
It's kind of an obvious thing that everyone recommends, but one thing is hearing it as a common wisdom
and completely different is coming to the same conclusion <b>from your data</b>.
</p></li>
<li>nutritional information contributes to <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="photos"><a href="#photos">¶</a>Photos</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: no extra effort required if you sync/organize your photos and videos now and then.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>obvious source of lifelogging, in addition comes with GPS data</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="pdfs"><a href="#pdfs">¶</a>PDF annotations</h3>
<div>
<p>
As in, <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#pdfs">native PDF annotations</a>. 
</p>
<p>
How: nothing needs to be done, PDFs are local to your computer. You do need <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my/blob/master/my/pdfs.py">some tools</a> to crawl your filesystem and extract the annotations.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
experience of using your PDF annotations (e.g. searching) is <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#comparison"><b>extremely poor</b></a>
</p>
<p>
I'm improving this by using <a href="#orger">orger</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">¶</a>Plaintext notes</h3>
<div>
<p>
Mostly this refers to org-mode files, which I use for notekeeping and logging.
</p>
<p>
How: nothing needs to be done, they are local. 
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#search">search</a> comes for free, it's already local</li>
<li><a href="#promnesia">better browsing history</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<h3 id="rtm"><a href="#rtm">¶</a>Remember the Milk</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: ical export from the API.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="#search">better search</a>
</p>
<p>
I stopped using RTM in favor of org-mode, but I can still easily find my old task and notes, which allowed for a smooth transition.
</p></li>

			    <p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="5:1-5:469"><strong>The EU wants to have all private chats, messages, and emails automatically searched for suspicious content, generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. The result: Mass surveillance through fully automated real-time messaging and chat control and the end of secrecy of digital correspondence. This blog post was first published on the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/?page_id=594160&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">website of Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer</a>.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="7:1-7:835">In 2020, the European Commission <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">proposed “temporary” legislation</a> aimed at allowing the search of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This is to allow the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process and using error-prone “artificial intelligence”. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed automatically and without human verification to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="9:1-9:301">Some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls. Through a second piece of legislation, the EU Commission intends to oblige all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="11:1-11:29"><strong>How does this affect you?</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto" data-sourcepos="13:1-20:0">
<li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:273"><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="14:1-14:315">If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos may be viewed</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-15:222"><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for “child grooming” frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="16:1-16:464"><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated</strong> for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, 90% of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. 40% of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for “child pornography” target minors.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="17:1-17:235">On your next <strong>trip overseas</strong>, you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy – with incalculable results.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="18:1-18:245"><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails</strong>. The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="19:1-20:0"><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="21:1-21:12"><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="23:1-23:716">Trilogue negotiations are underway between representatives of the European Parliament and EU governments with participation of the EU Commission regarding the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0568&amp;from=EN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">legislative proposal</a>.<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20201217_Four_Column_Tabe_ePrivacy_Derogation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> The different positions of the three institutions are listed here in detail (English)</a>. Child protection organizations are exerting massive pressure. All parliamentary groups are in favor of indiscriminate messaging and chat control, with the exception of Greens/EFA and the Left. The adoption of the legislation could take place in March.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="25:1-25:223">In April the EU Commission intends to make a second legislative proposal, which is to force all providers of email, messaging and chat services to comprehensively search all private messages in the absence of any suspicion.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="27:1-27:547">According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights and is prohibited (paragraph 177). For this reason, Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has filed a complaint against U.S. companies Facebook and Google with the data protection authorities for violating the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

<li data-sourcepos="49:1-49:202"><strong>Generate media attention!</strong> So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject – online and offline.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="50:1-51:0"><strong>Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers!</strong> Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="52:1-52:40"><strong>Additional information and arguments</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto" data-sourcepos="54:1-61:0">
<li data-sourcepos="54:1-54:720"><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime.</strong> Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring – contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications.</strong> According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="55:1-55:391"><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed.</strong> Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have reportedly circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="56:1-56:263"><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, 90% of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="57:1-57:563"><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk.</strong> Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="58:1-58:419"><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized.</strong> In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="59:1-59:502"><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates.</strong> Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or “harmful content”. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="60:1-61:0"><strong>The temporary legislation on the table is ineffective.</strong> Contrary to its …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-area"><p>I've been working with software for well over a decade, and honestly cannot remember when I started using Git. I used to be a bit wary of many commands but thought I had a good grasp on what to do when it came to git. Then I started a new role at a larger company, which had strict git guidelines. No more messy branches, no crappy commit messages, everything rebased. </p>
<p>Here is a list of all the things I wish I knew before starting this role. </p>
<p>Despite Git being very complicated, for day to day use it is really simple. I tend to make the workflow as simple as possible - I don't use aliases for git commands, I use the full arguments (<code>--force</code>) instead of the shortened ones (<code>-f</code>).</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts-of-git-i-already-knew-and-was-very-familiar-with">Basic concepts of Git I already knew and was very familiar with:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>git add</code> will 'stage' files, ready to be committed. </p>
<ul>
<li>A 'staged' file is a version of a file that is ready to be committed. If you use a GUI it will probably handle all of that for you, if not you can add files to be staged with <code>git add .</code> (or specific files).</li>
<li><code>git add .</code> to stage all</li>
<li><code>git add --patch</code> to interactively stage chunks of code (useful to review what changes you made)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git checkout</code> to change to a branch</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout -</code> to checkout the previous branch. So you could do <code>git checkout main; git pull; git checkout -; git rebase main</code> to checkout <code>main</code>, pull in changes, switch back to your original branch, and then rebase that original branch on main</li>
<li><code>git checkout -b create-a-new-branch</code> create a new branch. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git commit</code> creates a commit from the 'staged' files</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code> updates the previous commit with the 'staged' files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git status</code> tells you what the current status is (e.g. in the middle of a merge)</li>
<li>
<p><code>git diff</code> tells you what changed</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git diff --staged</code> to see the difference in staged files</li>
<li><code>git diff commit1..commit2</code> or <code>git diff branch1..branch2</code> show diff between commits/branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git push</code> will send the current branch to the remote repo (such as Github.com)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git push --force</code> overwrite changes when pushing</li>
<li><code>git push --force-with-lease</code> a safer version of <code>git push --force</code>, that will only overwrite if other commits were not added on the remote branch (e.g. by other users).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> will grab the changes from the remote location (such as Github.com)</li>
<li>
<p><code>git log</code> shows a log of commits with their commit hash &amp; messages</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git log --oneline</code> - easier to digest version</li>
<li><code>git log --graph</code> - useful to see branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git show</code> shows a commit's change</li>
<li>
<p><code>git bisect</code> to find out which commit introduced a bug</p>
<ul>
<li>binary search through commits (given a 'good' commit and a 'bad' commit). This is not a commonly used command for me so I won't go into detail but it is extremely handy to know about when needing to figure out when a bug was introduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The file <code>.gitignore</code> has a list of files to exclude from the git repo</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> I use this so rarely now that I can't remember the syntax at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-concepts-of-git-i-wish-i-knew">Basic concepts of Git I wish I knew:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A commit is like a list of changes to file(s), on a very basic level could be thought of as saying <code>change 5 characters on line 10 to "xxxxx"</code></li>
<li>
<p>Branches are like a pointer, they just point to a commit. Multiple branches can point to the same commit. When you are on a branch and you add a new commit, the branch is updated to point to your new commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>I used to think a branch was much more complicated than this.</li>
<li>You can change what commit a branch points to by checking out that branch (<code>git checkout some branch</code>) then setting it to point at a new commit hash (<code>git reset --hard 5255841aa</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can checkout single commits (<code>git checkout 5255841aaff441d275122b4abfb099b881de7cb5</code>) just like you can checkout branches (<code>git checkout some-branch</code>)</li>
<li>If you do something like <code>git commit --amend</code> to update the previous commit, the old commit is still around. (<code>git gc</code> will garbage collect these, but they stay around for at least a couple of weeks).</li>
<li>Every single change (even if you cannot easily find it by other means) can be found by looking at <code>git reflog</code>. It contains every single change, including changing branches, merging, rebasing. If you mess something up you can just look at the reflog and checkout a commit from before your changes. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="undoing-all-changes-since-your-last-commit">Undoing all changes since your last commit</h2>
<p>(You will lose staged/unstaged changes, this is a destructive command!)</p>
<p> If you have made some changes but decided you want to return to the state of the previous commit you can use <code>git reset --hard</code> to undo everything. This will mean any staged files (from <code>git add .</code>) will be removed.</p>
<p> A less destructive way to do this is to use <code>git stash</code>. It has the same effect, but the 'stashed' changes are still available. (see next section)</p>
<h2 id="use-git-stash">Use <code>git stash</code></h2>
<p>Git stash scared me. I used to use PHPStorm's 'shelve changes' as it felt a bit easier. Now I find that more awkward to use, as <code>git stash</code> is so simple.</p>
<p>You can use <code>git stash</code> to take any uncommitted changes and saves it in a temporary location. (This is not sent to Github when you push). </p>
<p>The changes are then undone, so you are back to the same state as your previous commit.</p>
<p>It will only stash files that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>either already being tracked by Git (in other words: files that exist elsewhere in your git repo)</li>
<li>and other files not yet tracked by Git (not in any commits) but are staged (e.g. from <code>git add .</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Git stash will not stash ignored files (from <code>.gitignore</code>), or new files that are not already elsewhere in your git repo and have not been staged (use <code>git add</code> to include them first)</p>
<p>You can then run <code>git stash apply</code> to replay those changes.</p>
<p>You can list all 'stashes' with <code>git stash list</code>, and then use <code>git apply 4</code> to apply the 4th one.</p>
<h2 id="use-git-rebase-and-git-rebase--i">Use <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git rebase -i</code></h2>
<p>I see <code>git rebase</code> and interactive git rebase (<code>git rebase -i</code>) as two completely separate commands. I'll cover them separately.</p>
<h3 id="git-rebase">Git rebase</h3>
<p>If you have 3 commits on the <code>main</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span></code></pre>
<p>and then make a branch from mainCommit 3, and add a couple of commits:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span>   </span><span>\_</span><span>______ branch1Commit1</span>
<span>            branch1Commit2</span>
<span>            branch1Commit3</span></code></pre>
<p>But then on the <code>main</code> branch more commits are added:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span>   </span><span>\_</span><span>______ branch1Commit1</span>
<span>            branch1Commit2</span>
<span>            branch1Commit3</span>
<span> mainCommit4</span>
<span> mainCommit5</span></code></pre>
<p>You may now want to 'rebase' your <code>branch1</code> commits on top of <code>main</code>.
This means you want to 'play' the changes in <code>branch1Commit1</code>, <code>branch1Commit2</code>, and <code>branch1Commit3</code> on top of <code>mainCommit5</code></p>
<p>If you run <code>git checkout branch1; git rebase main;</code> it will check out the <code>branch1</code> branch, and rebase it on top of the most recent commit on <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>So now it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span> mainCommit4</span>
<span> mainCommit5</span>
<span> branch1Commit1</span>
<span> branch1Commit2</span>
<span> branch1Commit3</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="when-is-this-useful">When is this useful?</h4>
<p>If you are working on your branch (<code>working-branch</code>), you realise a dependency needs updating. Maybe you create a new branch (<code>fix-dependency</code>), open up a new PR to update that dependency, and it gets merged into the <code>main</code> branch. Now you want to go back to <code>working-branch</code> and use the dependency. But of course, your branch was created before the dependency update was in <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span> someCommit</span>
<span>    </span><span>\_</span><span>_______ working-branch-commit1</span>
<span>              working-branch-commit2</span>
<span> fixDepencencyCommit</span></code></pre>
<p>So you would <code>checkout working-branch; rebase main</code> to rebase your commits in <code>working-branch</code> on top of <code>main</code>, and it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> someCommit</span>
<span> fixDepencencyCommit</span>
<span> working-branch-commit1</span>
<span> working-branch-commit2</span></code></pre>
<p>So you now have access to that branch.</p>
<p>Before understanding how <code>git rebase</code> worked I would have used <code>git cherry-pick</code>, which lets you get a specific commit and run those changes.</p>
<p>Note: You will often get merge conflicts when it tries to rebase. I love PHPstorm's interface for this. I think people who deal with complicated merge conflicts with just the command line tools are mental.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-rebase-git-rebase--i">Interactive rebase <code>git rebase -i</code></h3>
<p>This used to be the scariest thing for me to do, but now I am used to it interactive rebase is simple.</p>
<p>The typical syntax is: <code>git rebase -i $FROM_COMMIT</code>, where $FROM_COMMIT is the oldest commit you want to look at. I almost always just type <code>git rebase -i HEAD~10</code> which will be the 10th oldest one. </p>
<p>(<code>HEAD</code> points to the currently checked out branch's commit or the current commit).</p>
<p>Once you have typed <code>git rebase -i HEAD~4</code> you will see something like this (the commit summary messages are going to be whatever you enter - I've added the filenames to make this easier to explain):</p>
<pre><code><span>pick 913f120 feat: new blog - add blog.php</span>
<span>pick 2c2631b feat: add contact form - add contact.php</span>
<span>pick 67da3b4 fix: replace contact captcha - fix contact.php</span>
<span>pick 076c54a feat: update navbar with blog link - update navbar.php</span>

<span># Rebase 913f120..2c2631b onto 5dc1032 (4 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message</span>
<span># x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell</span>
<span># b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')</span>
<span># d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit</span>
<span># l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name</span>
<span># t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label</span>
<span># m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]</span>
<span># .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's</span>
<span># .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was</span>
<span># .       specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Note that empty commits are commented out</span></code></pre>
<p>What this is saying is that it will 'pick' those 4 commits, and run them in that order.</p>

      <hr>
<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.</p>
<p>Some quotes...</p>
<div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div id="content">
                
<blockquote>
<p>They know the water best who have waded through it.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>– Proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a Heaven did exist, it would not be a place where we have everything made for us; rather, it would be a place where everything we make is without defects.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Now, I know a lot about software bugs. I’ve written most of them. Sometimes nobody notices; at other times they cause serious &amp; embarrassing incidents. They bloom like flowers in a meadow. They take root in every garden. But they aren’t wild: everybody knows who planted them. And, if you will allow my stretching the simile to its furthest limits, they make our vibrant industry look like a flower shop.</p>
<p>An old joke goes that the chief executive of a large tech company gives a speech in which he asserts that, had cars been developed like software, they would cost a hundredth of what they do now &amp; run twice as far on a litre. “Yes”, an automotive exec replies later, “and they would crash once a week &amp; when you call for service, they’d tell you to reinstall the engine.”</p>
<p>Software is great: it does amazing things. But software is also bad: it’s bloated &amp; full of bugs. It may not be as buggy as it was twenty years ago, &amp; clearly it was never buggy enough for people not to use it, but it’s bad enough even so. You can easily confirm this yourself by searching a news aggregator for “software bug” or “software glitch” &amp; finding, as I now find from the past week alone, articles about <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4025865/software-errors-wipes-thousands-arrest-records-police-databases">150,000 arrest records disappearing in the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-software/volkswagen-recalls-56000-golf-models-for-software-update-idUSL8N2JN2HL">56,000 defective cars being recalled</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-19-vaccine-drive-tribal-rural-areas-challanges-7149270/">interruptions in the Indian vaccination drive</a> &amp; so on.</p>
<p>Or to borrow someone else’s words:</p>

<p>I think it’s highly embarrassing for this profession that “program crashes/hangs/malfunctions” is such a common occurrence that 5 billion non-developers are not only acutely aware of it, but consider it an unsurprising state of things.</p>

<p>What, then, to do? In general, you can get better at not writing bugs (1) by practicing writing code, (2) by changing the conditions that make them more likely &amp; (3) by figuring out which sorts of behaviours can prevent them. Here I want to discuss that last one: how should we write code so as to reduce the risk of introducing bugs? That means I won’t discuss tooling, learning, project management or anything of that sort: I will limit my discussion to the activity of programming &amp; will consider this in the context of software that is running in production systems, serving thousands or more users &amp; for which defects can have serious adverse consequences.</p>
<h2 id="consider-not-writing-the-code-in-the-first-place">Consider Not Writing the Code in the First Place <a href="#consider-not-writing-the-code-in-the-first-place">#</a></h2>
<p>Wayne Gretzky said that you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. I say that you have 0% chance of introducing bugs in code you don’t write.</p>
<p>If your software is not written yet, you will obviously need to write code. Or change may be necessary: you may be in a business where competition drives you to always come up with new ways of adding value, or maybe your software needs to adapt to changing external conditions. These are all good reasons to write code, but they are not all the reasons that we write code. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/04/A-culture-of-stability-and-reliability.html">There’s no reason to think that software needs to change forever.</a> Many features are negotiable.</p>
<p>Two types of code changes are relevant here, I think. The first is a change needed to implement new features. The second is refactoring, that is changing code in order to better structure it without modifying its behaviour.</p>
<p>A code change that implements a new feature is additive &amp; therefore makes the software more complex. It is harder to avoid writing bugs in complex software. It is also harder to diagnose &amp; fix bugs in complex software. Therefore, additive code changes involve both a direct risk &amp; an indirect risk of introducing new bugs. That should make us think twice as hard before introducing new features, but in fact it is usually taken for granted that new features are good for software. Rid yourself of that assumption. You or somebody else should, before implementing a new feature, ask yourselves the question: how much marginal value does this feature provide for the user?</p>
<p>Refactoring is praised everywhere. And I’m not here to say it isn’t important; it is our finest weapon in the perpetual war against entropy. But every time you refactor something, there is a risk that you introduce a new bug.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> The risk can be reduced with robust testing, as we shall see below. But it will never go away completely.</p>
<p>You need to balance the need for refactoring against the need for reliability &amp; stability. Ask yourself questions like, how long will the software be maintained? how important is reliability &amp; stability to it? how much do you expect the intended change will improve the code? &amp; so on. Think critically. We often start refactoring code not because it is in a particularly bad condition but because <em>we can &amp; know how to do it</em>. But that is a mistake. We are making ourselves slaves to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">the politician’s syllogism</a>, which, adapted somewhat, says: we must refactor things; I can refactor this thing; therefore, I must refactor this thing.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-do-have-to-make-a-change%2C-make-it-as-small-as-possible">If You Do Have to Make a Change, Make It As Small As Possible <a href="#if-you-do-have-to-make-a-change%2C-make-it-as-small-as-possible">#</a></h2>
<p>The second maxim is a corollary of the first. It begins with the observation that, in practice, it can be tempting to make some changes that are not directly related to whatever it is you are doing at the time. For example, maybe you are fixing a bug but notice that the component or function you’re looking at is very long &amp; could, so you reason, be split up into several smaller, composable functions. That’s an admirable aim. But it increases the risk of introducing a new bug, at least in the short term. If it happens, consider not making that additional change, or, if you do decide to go through with it, making the change separately from the fix. That is better because small, monadic changes are easier to test &amp; easier to review.</p>
<p>I make an exception here for whenever you can actually meaningfully reduce complexity, such as by removing branches from a conditional expression. Another exception would be to refactor code as an initial step prior to making functional changes to a component, but that should be done in the spirit of the following maxim.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-want-to-refactor-something%2C-make-sure-it%E2%80%99s-covered-by-automated-tests">If You Want to Refactor Something, Make Sure It’s Covered by Automated Tests <a href="#if-you-want-to-refactor-something%2C-make-sure-it%E2%80%99s-covered-by-automated-tests">#</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that you are a spy. You are breaking into somebody’s apartment in order to find &amp; take copies of some or other document. Being a good spy, it is important to you that that the owner of the apartment doesn’t notice that you’ve been there. So before rummaging around, you take photos of every room in order that, once you have found &amp; copied the document, you can restore the apartment to its original condition. The photos you have taken are an external check on whether you are leaving the room in the same condition that you found it in. It doesn’t guarantee that nothing is out of place. But it increases the probability that there is no discernible change.</p>
<p>Refactoring something means changing its implementation internally without changing its behaviour externally. You can create an external check similar to the spy’s photos when refactoring by making sure that the thing you are refactoring is covered by automated tests.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> That way you can be more confident that the changes you make are not affecting the behaviour. You could almost make them without thinking at all, which brings me to the final maxim …</p>
<h2 id="when-you-make-a-change%2C-make-sure-you-understand-what-you%E2%80%99re-doing">When You Make a Change, Make Sure You Understand What You’re Doing <a href="#when-you-make-a-change%2C-make-sure-you-understand-what-you%E2%80%99re-doing">#</a></h2>
<p>Before personal desktops were able to compile code, it had to be compiled on mainframes which often had to be booked in advance.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> That meant that programmers had to check their code carefully before compiling it, so as not to risk, should the program fail to compile, having to wait again in order to redo it. These days, we get near-instant feedback, not only from our compilers but also from running &amp; testing our code. This feedback loop has been shortened further by advances like hot reloading. This is great because it helps us to iterate quickly &amp; work in a state of flow. But it also allows us to code without really thinking hard about what we are doing.</p>
<p>Exactly that happens to me now &amp; again, usually when I’m lacking mental energy. Maybe I’m not considering all the possible inputs that a function can receive, or maybe I’m not thinking about all the possible branches in a conditional expression. I am confident that the thing I’m doing right now is correct. But I don’t know whether it is messing something up elsewhere.</p>
<p>When this happens, there is a kind of hill to climb, a hill from which everything is visible in a clearer light. I know this, but still I don’t always find it in myself to go there. This is pure weakness of the will. The hard thing is to notice it. Having noticed it, you can either put the task aside to do when you have more energy, or summon up the strength to do the thing properly.</p>
<p>It may help you to imagine that you are going to deploy your change to be tested by a grizzled old no-nonsense manual tester. If there’s a bug in your code, this tester is going to find it. Manual testing is like the tort system: as when a person is injured by a product they can sue the manufacturer, causing manufacturers to worry about their products’ safety, so the manual tester can file a report when they discover a bug, causing you to worry about your code’s correctness. But you can worry without the punitive threat, too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>What normally happens to bugs is that they are fixed &amp; forgotten. When we discover them, we are interested in fixing them, not in understanding the reasons why they happened; &amp; even if we are so interested, we only rarely remember the conditions of their origin anyway. But it doesn’t have to be like that. The way out of this is obvious. To avoid error, we must study error.</p>
<p>Never let a good incident go to waste. Each bug is an invitation to …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Friday, February 5, 2021</p><p>Sanakirja is a key-value store based on B trees, written in Rust. In this post, I reflect on some design and programming methodology mistakes I’ve made. Benchmarks show that the latest version beats LMDB, the fastest C equivalent, by 20%-50% on a use case similar to my most common load (storing graphs in Pijul).</p><p>My last post about Sanakirja sparked a few really constructive discussions, and made me realise that people still cared about the problem of on-disk key-value stores, as unfancy as that problem may sound. This post looks back on some design mistakes I’ve made when I wrote it, and includes benchmarks showing <a href="#benchmarks">it’s now faster than the fastest equivalent C library</a>.</p><p>Also, as some readers have noted, “sanakirja” means “dictionary” in Finnish.</p><h2 id="why">Why?</h2><p>A long time ago, Pijul was using <a href="https://symas.com/lmdb/">LMDB</a> as its backend, with a number of fundamental limitations, including:</p><ul><li><p>Being <strong>restricted to two datatypes</strong>: an array of B+ trees where keys are byte strings and values are either (1) byte strings or (2) B+ trees where keys are bytestrings and values are zero-sized. In Rust terminology, this is equivalent to roughly 500 <em>tables</em>, where a <em>table</em> is either <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], &amp;[u8]&gt;</code> or <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], ()&gt;&gt;</code> (a.k.a. <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeSet&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;&gt;</code>).</p></li><li><p>Being written in C, meaning that it is potentially fast, but <strong>hard to extend</strong> in any nontrivial way. About the “fast” part, <a href="#benchmarks">my benchmarks</a> show that indeed, it is quite fast — just not as fast as a carefully-designed Rust version.</p></li><li><p>More importantly, I needed to <strong>fork tables</strong> efficiently, without copying anything. This was especially important back then, when Pijul tables for small repositories often weighed dozens of megabytes. It may be slightly less relevant now, but now that it’s there, there is no reason not to use it.</p><p>This is implemented with an extra table storing reference counts of each page that is referenced at least twice (in order to avoid infinite recursions, the table itself isn’t clonable, and therefore all its pages are referenced once).</p></li></ul><h2 id="why-a-redesign">Why a redesign?</h2><p>There were just too many reasons: performance was first, then the overly complicated concurrency model, the suboptimal algorithmic design, and the suboptimal software design. I’ll explain these in the reverse order (so skip ahead if you only want to see my benchmarks).</p><h3 id="personal-anecdote">Personal anecdote</h3><p>Sanakirja was the first Rust project I completed, and yet it requires all the worst memory tricks I’ve ever needed in Rust. In hindsight, I needed that crate, so it was right to write it, but this wasn’t the right way to learn Rust at all. I also knew very little about disk performance, and my goal at the time was really writing Pijul, not profiling databases. And as <a href="#benchmarks">the benchmarks</a> show, it wasn’t terribly slow either.</p><h3 id="no_std">#[no_std]</h3><p>That’s right, this new version works without the standard library. It’s fairly restricted in that case, since there’s no mmap. However, the allocator is generic, meaning that it could in principle be used to allocate different things, like hard drive sectors in a filesystem.</p><h3 id="software-engineering">Software engineering</h3><p>Implementing B trees isn’t particularly hard in theory, but some bits of practice make it non-trivial, like keys of varying sizes (these can even cause the tree to increase its depth in order to stay balanced and keep their long-term performance guarantees!). Another complication is that the main costly operation in an on-disk datastructure is accessing a sector that isn’t in RAM, either for reading or for writing, and keys and values may be large, so we need to avoid copying or moving things around. Yet another nontrivial feature is that we want operations to be transactional, and allow readers to access the database concurrently with a writer (in which case readers see the database as it was before the current writer started).</p><p>One issue is that in a first-time implementation, it isn’t obvious to tell what belongs to the “B tree level” (which handles the high-level operations and does the “page management”, meaning allocating and freeing pages), from the underlying “node level” implementation (dealing with byte representation of data). Before you know it, the two levels are mixed and make hypotheses on one another. This makes it hard to see what matters performance-wise, and what doesn’t. After looking at my code again recently, I’ve tried to formalise here the lessons I’ve learned since my first steps in Rust back in 2015:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trust the Rust compiler!</strong> In a stage of the learning where you spend most of your time <em>fighting</em> the borrow checker (it was worse then, we have non-lexical lifetimes now), it is sometimes hard to see past that stage and imagine how the compiler will optimise your code, or what the LLVM pass will do. Also, on-disk B trees must define their own data representation, since data stored with one version of the Rust compiler must be readable from another version. However, one thing I’ve noticed when rewriting it was that I was often reasoning about what branches the compiler would cut, what loops it could unfold, etc.</p><p>I guess what I mean here is, sometimes you don’t need complex genericity everywhere in order to reach your performance goals, checking a constant parameter at runtime, or thinking carefully about mutable and immutable variables, can actually become compile-time optimisations.</p></li><li><p>I usually tend to try and get stuff to work as quick as possible, then profile and improve (the <strong>make it work, then make it fast</strong> idea). However, this particular crate made we question that approach in some cases, because it tends to mix the different levels, and make them less clear. One thing I’ve learned is that spending time building, benchmarking and profiling <em>basic blocks</em> may seem like it can delay the overall plan; however, in this case, exploring different designs for the basic parts made it clear which features of the basic blocks were varying, and which were necessary, yielding a more modular design in the end, which was key to the performance improvements I got.</p></li><li><p>Part of the art of writing mathematical proofs, especially in a larger paper, is finding the <strong>“min-cuts” of the graph of arguments</strong>. In the case of proofs, this means finding the smallest set of hypotheses you need for a lemma, which can also be proven independently in other lemmas. This isn’t easy, because a smaller conclusion may sometimes mean you’ve lost some hypotheses you had during the proof, and you won’t be able to use them anymore. The same happens in code, when you refactor common operations and try to use nice, readable abstractions: while that sounds like a good thing to do, you may lose hypotheses on what is behind the abstractions.</p><p>Concretely, in Sanakirja, we can’t always write to pages to modify them, for example if they’re pointed to by another tree, or if the are visible to concurrent readers. This isn’t very complicated in the case of insertions, because the worst thing that may happen is a page split. The 169 lines of Rust for the <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pmeunier/sanakirja-1.0:main/OP6SVMOD2GTQ6.PAGQA">new version of <code>put</code></a> reflect that.</p><p>However, deletions are harder, since page merges might cascade: if two pages A and B are meant to be merged, the key between them in their parent P must be deleted from P, and that deletion might cause P to merge with its neighbour Q. However, if P is read-only and Q isn’t, doing the operation lazily means that we can merge P’s items directly into Q, rather than first copying P to delete a key, and then merging.</p><p>When I first wrote Sanakirja, I remember being pretty proud of the following trick to achieve this: I refactored common code in order to use the same function for merging, rebalancing and splitting pages: I would first create an iterator, and then “spread” it on one page (when merging) or two pages (when splitting or rebalancing). While this may seem an elegant refactoring of common code between the three main operations of a B tree, it is also “lossy” in terms of the hypotheses it can make over the items of the iterator.</p><p>More precisely, here is an edited version of what I was doing before (<code>iter_all</code> returns an iterator, a <code>struct</code> with private fields):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>      </span><span>// Build an iterator for the left page

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-00ce522ec52eb743ceca"><div><p>Many evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have a sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_immune_system">‘behavioral immune system’</a>. We are, so the story goes, endowed with a suite of sophisticated, evolved psychological mechanisms that enable us to effectively detect and avoid disease causing parasites and pathogens. Unfortunately, work on the ‘behavioral immune system’ is plagued by one key methodological issue, and ethnographic evidence points to a more complex picture.</p><p>The core problem with existing research on the ‘behavioral immune system’ is that it is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260115000246">largely</a> restricted to surveying people in modern nation-state societies. This is a big problem for two reasons. One, people in modern nation states tend to be aware of the germ theory of disease. That is, for cultural-historical reasons, they have scientifically informed knowledge of how disease is transmitted. This means disease-avoidance behavior can follow for reasons that are socially learned, and not the result of evolved mechanisms to avoid pathogens per se. </p><p>Consider for example an ethnographic account I <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/8/1/the-cause-of-illness">wrote of</a> previously, which demonstrates the behavioral contrast between someone with culturally learned knowledge of how pathogens spread compared to beliefs in a society with a different understanding of disease: “In <em>The Afterlife is Where We Come From</em> (2004), anthropologist Alma Gottlieb describes her fieldwork among the Beng farmers of West Africa. In this book, Gottlieb recounts her failure to persuade Beng villagers to boil their drinking water;</p><p>During our stays in Beng villages, Philip and I have always either boiled or filtered our own drinking water. To our dismay, our neighbors often derided our laborious efforts. One day we thought to explain our mysterious actions. The village had been experiencing an especially crippling outbreak of Guinea worm. After reading about the disease, Philip and I were convinced that polluted drinking water was the cause of our neighbors’ misery. We urged our friends to boil their water as protection against future infestation. But even our closest and most open-minded friends dismissed our suggestion with casual laughter. </p><p>“Can you see the worms in our water?” our friend Yacouba challenged us. We admitted we couldn’t. </p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with the water,” he insisted. “Anyway, even if the Guinea worms come to us through the water, they’re put there by witches.” Yacouba added emphatically, “Boiling the water wouldn’t stop the witches.” (Gottlieb, 189).”</p><p>Second, people in state societies often have access to culturally developed antiseptic systems and substances, facilitating greater pathogen avoidance than was often possible historically. This is important for an evolutionary model—if we want to investigate a pan-human ‘behavioral immune system’, and consider how it evolved, we should be looking at behavior in places where people don’t have historically recent knowledge of the germ theory of disease or access to antiseptic inventions, where they have to grapple with pathogens in contexts more similar to our evolutionary history than the <a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf">WEIRD</a> environments of today.</p><p>Let us consider a few domains where there is evidence across traditional societies that complicates that ‘behavioral immune system’ framework. </p><p>First, putrid or rotting meat. Anthropologist Frank Marlowe <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520253421/the-hadza">writes</a> of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of East Africa that, “the Hadza often eat very rotten week-old meat they scavenge from carnivores,” adding that, “The scavenged (and sometimes very rotten) meat also gives them stomachaches, even after they cook it, but not often enough to keep them from eating it.”</p><p>Anthropologist C.R. Hallpike touches on this a great deal in his book <em>Ship of Fools</em>, writing that, “In Papua New Guinea the people are even less fastidious about their pork when it is stinking, even cutting it up under water when the smell is too bad. And yes, sometimes they died from it. Biologists often tell us that we are protected by the vomiting reflex from eating meat that has begun to smell as it goes bad, but no one seems to have told primitive peoples about this.”</p><p>Missionary Angel Turrado Moreno <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SS18%27)&amp;docId=ss18-006&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">writes</a> among the Warao of the Amazon of the, “Fish and meat, half raw, spoiled, and even rotten, which they eat without the slightest scruple at any hour of the day or night.” Among the Yaghan of Tierra del Fuego beached whales were <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SH06%27)&amp;docId=sh06-003&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">often</a> feasted upon, even when putrid or rotting, and digestive disorders caused by spoiled meat were <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SH06%27)&amp;docId=sh06-001&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">said</a> to be common.</p><p>Now, to some degree this can fit within the ‘behavioral immune system’ framework, with the important acknowledgement that tradeoffs matter a great deal. In their paper on ‘Human pathogen avoidance adaptations’, evolutionary psychologists Joshua M. Tybur and Debra Lieberman <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15001670">write</a> that, “Individuals should be more willing to accept the potential costs of infection via food if nutrients are more needed.” Under this logic, the willingness to consume rotting or putrid meat reflects necessity borne from a scarcity or shortage of nutrients. This seems reasonable, although I think this is something that would still require greater investigation.</p><p>It is clear that ecological and cultural factors play an important role in disease avoidance behaviors to a degree that indicates the limitations of assuming humans have a powerful and predictably expressed ‘behavioral immune system’. For example, opportunities for good hygiene are often quite rare across many small-scale societies, and even if they are ecologically possible cultural beliefs and knowledge determine to a large degree what hygiene practices do or do not develop. Hallpike writes that, “Where water is scarce and is arduous to fetch, drinking and cooking take priority over hygiene by a wide margin, and I never saw the Konso [of Ethiopia] (or the Tauade [of New Guinea], for that matter) wash their hands before eating.”</p><p>Anthropologist Ran Singh Mann <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/Asia/AZ02%27)&amp;docId=az02-012&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">writes</a> among the Onge Andaman Islanders “The raw material for food is not properly cleaned. It is boiled in dirty water containing mud and dust. The utensil in which the food is cooked is hardly cleaned. It is used over and over again without being cleaned. Layers of dirt keep on accumulating on the utensils used for cooking and eating purposes. The dogs also eat the left-overs in the same containers.”</p><p>Beyond limited hygiene practices, extensive and visceral interactions with dead bodies offers one of the most powerful complications for the ‘behavioral immune system’ framework. Hallpike quotes a patrol officer writing in 1945 that among the Tauade, ““A recently bereaved widow had an arm bone, several rib bones and the complete hand of the late departed hanging on a string around her neck. She did not appear to mind the offensive odour.”” Among the <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/NorthAmer/NA10%27)&amp;docId=na10-001&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">Inuit</a> on Kodiak Island, “Nobody was afraid to touch a corpse,” and burials would not be conducted until the fourth day after death, “Until then the corpse is never left alone,” and is given a place in the main room of the house. Rituals involving corpses where also common among whale hunters in the region: “The whale hunters preserved the bodies of renowned men in caves, where they assembled prior to the hunt, <strong>carried the corpses to nearby streams, laid them in the water, and drank from this water</strong>.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612593965665_14924"><div><p>In Australia, James Dawson <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1030540750209966080">writes</a> that, “Before the minds of the aborigines were poisoned by the superstitions of the white people, they had not the slightest dread of the dead body of a friend, nor had they any repugnance to remain beside it." And, as I noted in a <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/6/19/visceral-insulation">previous article</a> touching on this topic, anthropologist Bruce Knauft described mourning rituals among the Gebusi of New Guinea,</p><p>The following morning, Dugawe’s body was grossly bloated. His swollen limbs oozed corpse fluid, and his peeling skin exposed putrid yellowgreen flesh. His belly and even his genitals had swelled with the gases of decomposition. The stench was unforgettable; it burned up my nose, down my throat, and into my brain. Equally powerful were the actions of Dugawe’s female kin. With unearthly sobs, they draped themselves physically over the corpse, lovingly massaged its slime, and drew back its skin. They rubbed their arms and legs with the ooze of the body. Corpse fluid on one’s skin is a tangible sign of grief, of physical as well as emotional connection to the deceased—making one’s own body like the corpse. Seeing this, Dugawe’s departing soul was said to know how much they cared for him and ease his anger at having died, at least a little (Knauft, 51).</p><p>See also <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2016/10/mummy-photography-ulla-lohmann/">mummification practices</a> among the Anga of New Guinea. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease)">kuru</a>, the prion disease that spread through ritual cannibalism among the Fore of New Guinea. </p><p>Blood rituals are also not <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1028119118329700353">uncommon</a>. As I previously <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/6/19/visceral-insulation">noted</a>, “Men of the Arunta foragers of Australia would drink some of each other’s blood under the belief that it would make them stronger and prevent treachery. Anthropologists Francis Gillen and Walter Spencer <a href="http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=browseAuthorsFullContext&amp;id=oi08-001">wrote</a> that, “If [a man] refused to drink the blood, then, as actually happened in one case known to us, his mouth would be forced open and blood poured into it, which would have just the same binding influence as if the drinking had been a voluntary one.” Gillen and Spencer also discuss practices of treating sickness with blood, adding that, </p><p>When a woman is very ill and weak, one of her male Umba, to whom she is Mia alkulla – that is, he is the son of one of her younger sisters – may volunteer to strengthen her with his blood, in which case all the women and children are sent away from her. <em>The man draws a quantity of blood from [his] sub-incised urethra, and she drinks part of it</em>, while he rubs the remainder over her body, adding afterwards a coating of red ochre and grease. [italics added]”</p><p>Warriors in some societies may <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1033189575269670913">smear the blood</a> of enemies on their bodies, or consume body parts to gain power. Among the <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?col=collection%28%27%2FeHRAF%2Fethnography%2FNorthAmer%2FNA08%27%29&amp;docId=na08-002&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;method=citation&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">Ingalik</a> hunter-gatherers of Alaska, “a warrior may eat the eye of a respected opponent whom he has killed.

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>

February 5, 2021 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/data-science-setup-with-swift-in-2021/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/data-science-setup-with-swift-in-2021/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started to work on a new data science related project last year. Our initial setup was fairly traditional: it is Python-centric, with <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> for dependency management and environment setup.</p>

<p>Anaconda is interesting. It is probably useful if you have a ton of dependencies and the system tries really hard to figure out the package compatibilities with each other based on their claims (version numbers of their dependencies). For us though, we only use a handful of packages with clean dependencies on each other (your usual suspects: <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>), and the version number check just means each time package upgrade is half-an-hour SMT solving.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I made my fortune in the past decade by doing app development (Facebook, Snapchat). I’ve been eyeing on Swift since the 1.0 version. Since then, the language matured a lot. After gaining some Swift experience with my last employer, it seems to be a good compromise between expressivity and performance. The noise from the language itself is minimal, and the performance can be tuned if you are hard on it, otherwise still better than raw Python.</p>

<p>After a few months of probing, investing, bug fixes, we’ve migrated our setup to Swift in last December. It has been serving us well so far.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<p>We have a small project, and the problem with packages mostly around package management and upgrade. Since Anaconda’s environment is not per project based, we have to switch back and forth when entering / leaving the project.</p>

<p>Our project, although small, is a bit exotic. Our core algorithm was implemented in C, and we don’t want to ship a Python plugin in-tree. Hence, we opt-ed to talk with the C lib through standard IO (subprocess). It turns out to be hairy and the core algorithm update process is more than terrible.</p>

<p>Pandas has a reasonable performance if these are builtin functions, once we drop to use apply / lambda, going through a few million rows for a particular column can take 30 to 40 seconds. For these cases, we also cannot use the rest of idle cores efficiently.</p>

<p>However, switching to a new language setup is not an easy task. Besides solving the above said problems, we would still like to keep a few things we liked with our old setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jupyter notebook:</strong> we really liked to do data exploration with Jupyter notebooks. Anything requires us to compile / run / print would be a no go. The interactive data exploration experience is essential for our workflow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pandas:</strong> we liked Pandas, it is a Swiss Army knife for data science. It also has a big API surface that would be very hard to reimplement from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PyCharm or alike IDE:</strong> we liked to use PyCharm for Python development a lot. Data inspection, re-run, and in general, debugging experience within an IDE is no comparison with tools like vim (although I still use vim for a lot of development personally).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-potential-choices">Other Potential Choices</h2>

<p>Before embarking on this quest, we briefly looked at other potential choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TypeScript / JavaScript:</strong> it has some interesting data exploration patterns, such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observablehq.com</a>. However, it doesn’t have good C library integration points, making the fore-mentioned core algorithm integration problem unsolved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rust:</strong> when I did my investigation, I didn’t notice the <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">evcxr</a> project. Other than that, the syntax for modeling would be a bit noisier than I’d like. The way to call Python through <a href="https://pyo3.rs/">PyO3</a> is a bit clumsy too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Julia:</strong> if I have more experience with the language, I may have a different opinion. But as it stands, the language has its own ecosystem, and I didn’t see a good way to call Python libraries from the language*. On the C lib integration part, it seems to require dynamic linking, and that would be a little bit more hurdle on my toolchain setup.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-setup">New Setup</h2>

<h3 id="monorepo">Monorepo</h3>

<p>Our new setup is a monorepo, with Bazel as the build system for both our Swift code, C libraries and our Python dependencies. In the meantime, we still have some legacy Python libraries that are now managed by Bazel too.</p>

<p>Bazel’s new <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python">rules_python</a> has a pretty reasonable <code>pip_install</code> rule for 3rd-party dependencies. As I mentioned, because we use relatively a small number of Python packages, cross package compatibility is not a concern for us.</p>

<p>All our open-source dependencies are managed through <code>WORKSPACE</code> rules. This worked for our monorepo because we don’t really have a large number of open-source dependencies in the Swift ecosystem. The things we import mostly are Swift <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics">numerics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms/">algorithms</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser">argument-parser</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jupyterlab">Jupyterlab</h3>

<p>We don’t use a separate Jupyter installation anymore. Jupyterlab is installed as a <code>pip_install</code> requirement for our monorepo. Opening a Jupyterlab would be as simple as <code>bazel run :lab</code>. This enables us to in-tree our Swift Jupyter kernel. We adopted the <a href="https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter">swift-jupyter</a> and added <a href="https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/pull/121">Bazel dependency support</a>. We also have a pending PR to upstream our sourcekit-lsp integration with the Swift Jupyter kernel.</p>

<p>This complicates a bit on plugin management for Jupyterlab. But we haven’t yet found a well-maintained out-of-tree plugin that we would like to use.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>To support calling Python from Swift, we opted to use <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit">PythonKit</a> library. We’ve upstreamed <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit/pull/28">a patch</a> to make Pandas work better within Swift. We made a few more enhancements around <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/PythonKit/commit/0973cebf0dfc66ffd486639108ea8e439c8212bd">UnboundedRange syntax</a>, <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/PythonKit/commit/af00ca39bc5366aff3a30d8841220128d1eec221">passing Swift closures as Python lambda</a>, which haven’t been upstreamed at the moment.</p>

<p>One thing that makes calling Python from Swift easy is the use of reference counting in both languages. This makes memory management cross the language boundary much more natural.</p>

<p>We also wrote a simple <code>pyswift_binary</code> macro within Bazel such that a Swift binary can declare their Python dependencies and these will be setup properly before invoking the Swift binary.</p>

<p>We haven’t yet vendoring our Python runtime at the moment. Just painstakingly making sure all machines on Python 3.8. However, we do intend to use <code>py_runtime</code> to solve this discrepancy in the future.</p>

<h3 id="c-libraries">C Libraries</h3>

<p>Swift’s interoperability with C is top-notch. Calling and compiling C dependencies (with Bazel) and integrating with Swift is as easy as it should be. So far, we’ve fully migrated our core algorithms to Swift. The iterations on the core algorithms are much easier.</p>

<h3 id="ide-integration">IDE Integration</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons, we cannot use PyCharm with Swift. However, we successfully migrated most of our workflow to VS Code. LLDB support makes debugging easy. However, we did compile our own Swift LLDB with Python support for this purpose (still in the process to figure out with the core team why the shipped Swift LLDB on Linux has no Python support).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp">Sourcekit-lsp</a> doesn’t recognize Bazel targets. The work for Build Server Protocol support on both Bazel side and on sourcekit-lsp side seems stalled at the moment. We ended up writing a simple script to query compilation parameters from <code>bazel aquery</code> for all our Swift source code, and put these into <code>compile_commands.json</code>. Sourcekit-lsp just has enough support for Clang’s <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">compilation database format</a> to make code highlighting, auto-complete, go to definition and inline documentation work again.</p>

<p>We committed <code>.vscode/settings.json.tpl</code> and <code>.vscode/launch.json.tpl</code> into the codebase. Upon initial checkout, a small script can run to convert these template files into actual <code>settings.json</code> and <code>launch.json</code>. We did this to workaround issues with some VS Code plugins requiring absolute paths. These two files will keep in sync with the templates as part of the build process ever since.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<p>Swift’s argument-parser library makes creating command line tools really easy. Furthermore, it also supports auto-complete in your favorite shells. We implemented one all-encompassing CLI tool for our monorepo to do all kinds of stuff: data downloading, transformation, model evaluation, launching Jupyterlab etc. With auto-completion and help messages, it is much easier to navigate than our previous <code>./bin</code> directory with twenty-something separate scripts.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-the-end">Is this the End?</h2>

<p>We’ve been happy with this new setup since the beginning of this year, but it is far from the end-all be-all solution.</p>

<p>Swift is great for local development, however, the Bazel support on Linux generates binary that dynamically links to Swift runtime. This makes deployment a little bit more involved than we’d like it to be.</p>

<p>Pandas uses internal data structure for DataFrame (column-based numpy). While we do have efficient numpy to tensor conversions, these cannot be leveraged in the context of Pandas (we want to lift the whole data frame, not just numpy-ready columns). Our current solution calls itertuples, which can be quite slow. We’d like to sponsor an open-source project to implement <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> support for Swift. This should enable us to pass data from Pandas to Swift through Arrow in-memory format, which may be faster than what we currently do.</p>

<p>Disqus is a free commenting system and a great example of "if you're not paying for it, you become the product". Unfortunately, in Disqus' case, your website visitors become the product too.</p><p>Today, I'm going to analyze what happens when you embed Disqus on your website.</p><p>I signed up at <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and added the installation code to a <strong>blank page</strong> (So, I'm sure every HTTP request that the browser makes is from Disqus).</p><p>Disqus makes 76 HTTP requests and fetches 2MB of data! (even with 0 comments).

Disqus makes HTTP requests to 11 different third-party domains through the browser. <strong>All of these websites are trackers/pixels</strong> (Even some were detected as malware by my security guard).</p><p>Here are the external domains:</p><ul><li><a href="https://viglink.com/">viglink.com</a>* - One of Disqus's major partners. Disqus use Viglink to personalize ads.</li><li><a href="http://io.narrative.io/">io.narrative.io</a> - "The data streaming platform that makes it easy to buy, sell, and win."</li><li><a href="http://live.rezync.com/">live.rezync.com</a> - a pixel website</li><li><a href="https://idsync.rlcdn.com/">idsync.rlcdn.com</a> - another pixel (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://netc.sfr.fr/">netc.sfr.fr</a> - another pixel (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://p.rfihub.com/">p.rfihub.com</a> - another pixel, malware reports on Google (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://pixel.tapad.com/">pixel.tapad.com</a> - pixel, main site titled "WE PROVIDE THE WORLD’S LEADING DIGITAL CROSS-DEVICE GRAPH"</li><li><a href="http://pippio.com/">pippio.com</a> - redirects to liveramp.com, titled "Build better data-driven customer experiences."</li><li><a href="https://ei.rlcdn.com/">ei.rlcdn.com</a>, <a href="https://idsync.rlcdn.com/">idsync.rlcdn.com</a> - website returns 404, GIF pixel used</li><li><a href="http://tag.clrstm.com/">tag.clrstm.com</a></li><li><a href="https://ib.adnxs.com/">ib.adnxs.com</a> - Malware site, "Adnxs appeared as the eighth-biggest name in our Tracking the Trackers data."</li></ul><p>If you are not familiar with Pixels/Trackers, take Facebook as an example. You can place a pixel on your website to share your website traffic data with Facebook. Facebook uses this data for better personalized targeting. According to GDPR, you cannot place the code without your users' consent in the EU region. But, Disqus places all of these pixels on your website (inside their iframe) without any consent.</p><p>*In 2014, Disqus inserted Viglink affiliate links to their client sites intrusively (<a href="https://poststatus.com/disqus-potentially-adding-affiliate-links-users-content-opted/">Source</a>)</p><p>When you provide a free product, money should come from somewhere. Disqus uses advertising for that. Now, I subscribed to a paid plan trial of Disqus to see if things change or not. No! Even in the paid plans, the same pixels are loaded on the client-side. Looks like there's no way to opt-out from tracking.</p><p>Even I title the article "the dark commenting system", I'm not sure if Disqus is a commenting system.

<p>To get the current balance of an account, we sum the changes in <code>delta_balance</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SUM</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'delta_balance'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>balance</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance</span>
<span>---------+---------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>data</code> field contains information specific to each type of event. To extract the value of <code>delta_balance</code> from the <code>data</code> column we use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-OP-TABLE" rel="noopener">arrow operator provided by PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the query shows that the current balance of account 1 is -30. This means the account is in overdraft. To check if this is within the allowed range, we need to compare it to the credit set for this account. The credit for account 1 was initially set to 0 when the account was created. The credit was then adjusted twice, and is currently set to 100.</p>
<p>To get the current state of an account, we need its aggregated balance and the latest credit that was set for it.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h2>
<p>In Oracle there is a function called <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions071.htm" rel="noopener"><code>last</code></a> we can be use to get the last <code>credit_set</code> event. A query using <code>last</code> might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Oracle</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>CASE</span> <span>WHEN</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span> <span>THEN</span> <span>data</span> <span>ELSE</span> <span>null</span> <span>END</span><span>)</span>

<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL also has a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html#id-1.5.8.26.6.2.2.10.1.1" rel="noopener"><code>LAST_VALUE</code></a> analytic function. Analytics functions cannot be used in a group by the way aggregate functions do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>LAST_VALUE</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>

    <span>event</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span>ERROR:</span><span>  column "event.data" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function</span>
<span>LINE 3:</span><span>     LAST_VALUE(data) OVER (</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The error tells us that the <code>data</code> field used in the analytic function must be used in the group by. This is not really what we want. To use PostgreSQL's <code>LAST_VALUE</code> function, we need to remove the group by:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>LAST_VALUE</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>

<span> account |     credit</span>
<span>---------+-----------------</span>
<span>       1 | {"credit": 100}</span>
<span>       1 | {"credit": 100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These are not exactly the results we need. Analytic, or window functions, operate on a set of rows, and not in a group by.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL doesn't have a built-in function to obtain the first or last value in a group using group by.</strong></p>
<p>To get the last value in a group by, we need to get creative!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="old-fashioned-sql"><a href="#old-fashioned-sql">Old Fashioned SQL</a></h2>
<p>The plain SQL solution is to divide and conquer. We already have a query to get the current balance of an account. If we write another query to get the credit for each account, we can join the two together and get the complete state of an account.</p>
<p>To get the last event for each account in PostgreSQL we can use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-DISTINCT" rel="noopener"><code>DISTINCT ON</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>account</span><span>)</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span>

<span>account | credit</span>
<span>---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 | 100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Using <code>DISTINCT ON</code> we got the last credit set for each account.</p>

<p>The next step is to join the two queries, and get the complete account state:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>,</span>

        <span>account</span>

    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>a</span>
    <span>JOIN</span>
    <span>(</span>

    <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>account</span><span>)</span>
        <span>account</span><span>,</span>
        <span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>

    <span>ON</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>account</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance | credit</span>
<span>---------+---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30 | 100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We got the expected result.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let's take a glance at the execution plan:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>                                         QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=44.53..49.07 rows=4 width=44)
   Hash Cond: (event.account = b.account)
   -&gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=25.00..27.00 rows=200 width=12)
         Group Key: event.account
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on event  (cost=0.00..17.50 rows=750 width=36)
   -&gt;  Hash  (cost=19.49..19.49 rows=4 width=36)
         -&gt;  Subquery Scan on b  (cost=19.43..19.49 rows=4 width=36)
               -&gt;  Unique  (cost=19.43..19.45 rows=4 width=40)
                     -&gt;  Sort  (cost=19.43..19.44 rows=4 width=40)
                           Sort Key: event_1.account, event_1.id DESC
                           -&gt;  Seq Scan on event event_1  (cost=0.00..19.39 rows=4 width=40)
                                 Filter: (type = 'credit_set'::text)
</pre></div>


<p>The event table is being scanned twice, once for each subquery. The <code>DISTINCT ON</code> subquery also requires a sort by <code>account</code> and <code>id</code>. The two subqueries are then joined using a hash-join.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL is unable to combine the two subqueries into a single scan of the table.</strong> If the event table is very large, performing two full table scans, and a sort and a hash join, might become slow and consume a lot of memory.</p>
<div>
<p>common table expression</p>
<p>It's tempting to use common table expression (CTE) to make the query more readable. But, <a href="https://hakibenita.com/be-careful-with-cte-in-postgre-sql">CTE's are currently optimization fences</a>, and using it here will most definitely prevent PostgreSQL from performing any optimization that involves both subqueries.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-array-trick"><a href="#the-array-trick">The Array Trick</a></h2>
<p>Using good ol' SQL got us the answer, but it took two passes on the table. We can do better with the following trick:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db#=&gt;</span><span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SUM</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'delta_balance'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>balance</span><span>,</span>
<span>    <span>(</span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
</span><span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance | credit</span>
<span>---------+---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30 |    100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is so much simpler than the previous question, so let's break it down.</p>
<h3 id="how-postgresql-compares-arrays"><a href="#how-postgresql-compares-arrays">How PostgreSQL Compares Arrays</a></h3>
<p>To understand what exactly is going on here, we first need to understand <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html" rel="noopener">how PostgreSQL compares arrays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array comparisons compare the array contents element-by-element, using the default B-tree comparison function for the element data type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When comparing arrays, PostgreSQL will go element by element and compare the values according to their type. To demonstrate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>greatest</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>200</span><span>],</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>]);</span>
<span> greatest</span>
<span>----------</span>
<span> {2,100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first element of the second array (2) is larger than the first element of the first array (1), so it's the greatest.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>greatest</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>200</span><span>],</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>201</span><span>]);</span>
<span> greatest</span>
<span>----------</span>
<span> {1,201}</span>
<span>(1 row)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first elements of both arrays are equal (1), so PostgreSQL moves on to the next element. In this case, the second element of the second array (201) is the greatest.</p>
<h3 id="max-by-key"><a href="#max-by-key">Max by Key...</a></h3>
<p>Using this feature of PostgreSQL, we construct an array where the first element is the value to sort by, and the second element is the value we want to keep. In our case, we want to get the credit by the max <code>id</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Not all events set credit, so we need to restrict the result to <code>credit_set</code> events:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The result of this expression is an array:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db#=&gt;</span><span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account |   max</span>
<span>---------+---------</span>
<span>       1 | {6,100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We only want the second element, the value of <code>credit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And this is it! This way we can get the last credit set for each account.</p>
<p>Next, let's examine the execution plan:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=32.50..34.50 rows=200 width=16)
   Group Key: account
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on event  (cost=0.00..17.50 rows=750 width=72)

<p>These are some of the things I think about when trying to write clean, readable code.</p>
<h2 id="prioritize-clarity">Prioritize Clarity</h2>
<p>There are many ways to write any piece of code. Some will run faster, some will take less memory, some will be easier to test. And some will be more clear.</p>
<p>The first step to writing clear code is to make it a priority.</p>
<p>This means you have to deprioritize other aspects, like speed. There’s no such thing as prioritizing one thing without deprioritizing something else (when everything is a priority, nothing is).</p>
<h2 id="develop-a-sense-for-clarity">Develop a sense for clarity</h2>
<p>Writing well requires knowing what good writing looks like, and creating clear code requires knowing what clear code looks like. Reading well-regarded code can give you a sense of what good can look like.</p>
<p>A good sense for clear code won’t keep you from writing unreadable code, but it will tell you what parts don’t smell right.</p>
<h2 id="edit">Edit</h2>
<p>Your first idea for how to write the code will rarely be the most clear.</p>
<p>It’s often easier to find a readable way to write code after you’re finished with the mental work of getting the first version written down. Reading back over what you just wrote will help give ideas for how to improve it.</p>
<h2 id="start-by-explaining">Start by explaining</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure how to organize the code, start by explaining what needs to be done as though you are telling it to another person (or rubber duck). Write it down: “Well, we need to skip it if the user is deleted, or if the order is already in progress…” Take that explanation and transform it into code.</p>
<p>When laying out the code, it’s better to be thinking in terms of human communication rather than machine abstractions.</p>

<p>Add comments that explain why the code is doing what it is doing, or is structured the way that it is structured.</p>
<p>Just reading the logic won’t tell you why the author thought that was the right logic. There might be some business reason you don’t know about - perhaps users outside the US sometimes put the street number at the end of the first line of the address. Or maybe there is some little technical detail - this query is structured in this weird way to convince Postgres to optimize it correctly. These are added bits of context that don’t exist in the code itself.</p>
<p>Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking!</p>
<p>Even if it is possible to understand the reasoning from just reading the code, it’s hard mental work that can be very easily prevented.</p>
<h2 id="dont-mix-levels">Don’t mix levels</h2>
<p>Don’t mix levels of abstraction within a method.</p>
<p>This mixes levels of abstraction:</p>

<p>This doesn’t:</p>

<p>Mixing levels of abstraction makes the reader jump between thinking about what is being done and how it is implemented.</p>
<p>When you talk about what code does, you are talking about the current level of abstraction. When you talk about how the code does it, you are talking about the next level of abstraction down.</p>
<p>In the <code>welcome</code> method, what it does is send a welcome email if it has not already been sent. How it determines if the email was already sent is to query the database of past email records. Notice that the second version of <code>welcome</code> moves the ‘how’ to a separate method. It’s only concerned with the ‘what’, meaning it stays at one level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Make each function live at one level of abstraction, and delegate lower-level details to methods at lower levels of abstraction. Methods with a single level of abstraction tend to read like a story about what is going on.</p>
<h2 id="break-out-functions">Break out functions</h2>
<p>Big functions can (sometimes!) be made more readable by breaking them up into smaller functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes that function acts like a series of steps, in which case it works well to extract a function for each step. Other times, there are different decisions to be made, each of which could be made in a different function. Perhaps there’s parts of the function that act like making a decision and parts that act like taking action. There’s a lot of different dimensions you can use to split up a function. It takes practice to get good at seeing the right one to use.</p>
<p>Smaller functions have some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each bit of logic is given a name. This makes it easier to know what each bit of logic is for and helps you find where a bit of logic lives.</li>
<li>There are fewer variables in scope.</li>
<li>It’s easier to tell what the program was “thinking” when you look at a stack trace or run a debugger.</li>
<li>The small functions can be tested separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers would work fine with no functions at all. Functions exist for the sake of programmers, so make good use of them.</p>
<h2 id="dont-break-out-functions">Don’t break out functions</h2>
<p>The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) idea is often taken too far.</p>
<p>Now, it’s a very good idea to extract magic numbers to constants and have one copy of the logic for making a particular decision. Repeating those bits of code is a bad idea.</p>
<p>DRY starts to go too far when two functions that happen to share a handful of lines become a target for deduplication. Completely avoiding duplicated lines means that you’ll end up with confusing, nonsense abstractions that exist only to hold those few shared lines. This makes the code weirdly hard to change because the structure of two unrelated pieces of code will be tied together.</p>
<p>The test for whether some pieces of code should be deduplicated is simple: would anything bad happen if one was changed without also changing the other? If the answer is yes, then make a single source of truth for it. If not, consider leaving it alone.</p>
<p>The point of DRY isn’t to run a manual compression process on the codebase, it’s to avoid a dependency where two parts of the code need to be manually kept in sync. Remember, deduplicating code is not the same thing as creating an abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-configurable-functions">Avoid configurable functions</h2>
<p>Prefer many functions to a few, configurable functions.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve seen stories like this one: you start off with a clean function that’s called in three different places. You want to use it in a fourth place, but it needs to do something slightly different, so you add a configuration parameter. Then the first caller gets a new feature, requiring two more configuration parameters. A fifth use case is added with its own special parameter. Caller #2 is too slow, so you add yet another parameter for skip part of the work.</p>
<p>Somehow, your clean function that started life doing one thing now has 5 configuration parameters and does potentially 2^5 = 32 different things (or more)!</p>
<p>It’s much better to have multiple functions, each of which does just one thing.</p>
<p>Once you have separate functions, there will of course be duplication. When those shared parts need to be kept in sync, apply DRY and extract them to shared functions. This is easier if the function is already broken down into subfunctions for decisions and steps.</p>
<p>Remember, a few duplicated lines is fine! If each of the separate functions has its own for-loop over a list, that’s very acceptable duplication.</p>
<p>One advantage of this approach is that when one use-case goes away, you can easily delete the relevant function. You don’t have to dig around in the logic of a complicated function to tease out the parts that were for that particular set of options.</p>
<p>Readers of a special-purpose function will find it much easier to understand what it does.</p>
<p>(Note that this is only the right approach if you control all the callers of the function. If you function is part of a public API, then the reasoning here doesn’t apply because you don’t know what all the usecases are or will be.)</p>
<h2 id="dont-prematurely-optimize">Don’t prematurely optimize</h2>
<p>Race cars go faster than normal cars, but at the expense of having hard seats, making lots of noise, and lacking A/C. If you don’t know that your function is going to need to be a race car, don’t strip out the A/C yet. Leave the creature comforts in - focus on writing code that is easy for humans to read instead of easy for computers to run.</p>
<p>The same is true about premature generalization. You wouldn’t buy a dump truck if you don’t need to haul huge loads of things, so you also shouldn’t make your code able to serve all kinds of needs that may never happen.</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is this weekend, and you know what that means: Superb Owl! and Sportsball! memes galore. But I noticed that many of my friends who mock the sport also love strategy games like Magic the Gathering, Starcraft, or 7 Wonders — and thus I know they can appreciate a well-designed game.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesportsarchives.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/playbook.jpg?resize=480%2C398" alt="Image result for football strategy" width="480" height="398" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://thesportsarchives.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/playbook.jpg?resize=480%2C398&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>There are plenty of reasons to criticize the NFL: a hypocritical position on brutal hits, stinginess in paying the refs, the exploitation of unpaid college athletes, and of course the (somewhat improving) issue of concussions and player safety.</p>



<p>But for my fellow nerds, here are some elements of the National Football League that you can look at on a strategic game-design level and say “Ok, that’s actually really cool.”</p>



<hr>



<h2>Nine? Elements of Football that Reflect Good Strategic Game Design</h2>



<h3>Resource Management:</h3>



<p>Like most good games, a key component is making smart decisions about where to invest your resources.</p>



<h4>Money: </h4>



<p>In the NFL, the collective bargaining agreement between owners and the players’ union sets a salary cap to set a maximum (and minimum) that teams can spend each year.</p>



<p>Would you want to pay premium for a star or spread that salary around and upgrade more positions? It might depend on synergies with the rest of your roster. (Or you can get lucky with a player like Tom Brady who takes less money than his market value so his team can surround him with more talent.)</p>



<p>Rookies, as unproven quantities, are typically signed on a very affordable contract for their first few years, whereas established veterans can be much pricier. Teams are faced with the question of where they can afford to have uncertainty on their roster — contenders rarely want to risk an unproven player at quarterback, while teams that are a bit further away can take that gamble.</p>



<h4>Time / (Plus Good Catch-up Mechanics):</h4>



<p>In any game, there’s incentive for the person losing to resort to riskier higher-variance strategies. In football, that’s passing plays, which have a chance of gaining a lot of yards or not being caught at all. A neat aspect of football is that incomplete passes can stop the clock.</p>



<p>When a team is behind, time is one of the most precious resources it has, so this means the game is structured to give them every opportunity to claw their way back. Deciding when to burn time (and time-outs) is cruicial, and something even the best coaches struggle to do well.</p>



<h4>Energy Level in Game:</h4>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/19/AP_17268774082780.jpg?w=200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for football huddle" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/19/AP_17268774082780.jpg?w=200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This is a minor point, but one I found really neat: Playing defense tends to be more exhausting than playing offense. If an offense can run many plays in rapid succession without huddling up or substituting — and thus prevent the defense from substituting in fresh players as well — they can gain an edge over an increasingly-tired defense.</p>



<h3>Synergies Between Players and Schemes</h3>



<h4>Building a roster</h4>



<p>Of course, the downside of this kind of “Hurry up offense” is that the offense is also stuck with the same players on the field and doesn’t have as much time for coaches to call the next play. Teams that want to use more hurry-up offense may need to hire versatile players who can be counted on to run many types of play, and an experienced quarterback who can make smart changes on the fly.</p>



<p>Since players have unique skill sets, teams need to build around who’s coming out of college and who they can afford to sign. Just like putting together a Magic the Gathering or Netrunner deck to find and build on synergies, Football has fantastic interplay between skills, style, and strategy.</p>



<p>Finding a generational talent like Detroit’s ultra-elusive running back Barry Sanders opens up a host of new options for a team. The Detroit Lions never focused on their offensive linemen — who would try to clear the way for him — because, frankly, Barry could succeed without them. (Until he got fed up and retired early, which is a story of its own.)</p>



<p>If a team has a quarterback with pinpoint accuracy but a weak arm, paying for blazing fast wide receivers to race down the field and catch deep passes doesn’t make as much sense as signing shifty and precise route-runners. However, to make good use of a quarterback with a cannon-arm, fast receivers aren’t enough — he needs strong offensive linemen to protect him and give him time to throw.</p>



<p>There are countless interactions between strategic decisions and I love it.</p>



<h3>Strategic Structural Asymmetries</h3>



<h4>Stadiums and Cities Matter</h4>



<div><p>Even the stadium and climate in a city factor into a football team’s strategy.</p><p>Because it’s considered more difficult to pass the ball in cold and windy weather, teams in the frigid Northern divisions are more likely to focus on building a running attack and a defense that can stop the other team from running successfully. As winter approaches, they can count on the environment to limit the passing game.</p></div>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/octanecdn.com/roofitforwardcom/B613E8A56F6C8DF5015D88C9634BC66C.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for nfl retractable roofs" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/octanecdn.com/roofitforwardcom/B613E8A56F6C8DF5015D88C9634BC66C.jpg?w=350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>However, roughly a third of teams play in indoor stadiums — eliminating the weather and the wind to make passing strategies more effective. Since half a team’s games are played at home, it has disproportionate impact on how they want to build a roster. A few stadiums even have retractable roofs, which let them decide whether to allow the elements to impact the game!</p>



<h4>Leveraged Division Structure</h4>



<p>An NFL division is comprised of four teams who play each other twice every season. The team in each division with the best record is guaranteed a spot in the playoffs. (Even if NONE of the teams were very good – the Washington Football Team made the playoffs this year despite losing more than half their games!)</p>



<p>This makes it even more crucial to plan how to counter division opponents’ schemes, and those rivalry games are usually close and exciting.</p>



<p>If an opposing team in your division has exceptionally tall, strong receivers you can’t afford to be caught assigning small cornerbacks to guard them. You’d need to keep that in mind when building a roster.</p>



<h3>Well Designed Scoring System</h3>



<h4>Intermittent Scoring to Build Excitement Throughout</h4>



<p>In the NBA, a jaw-dropping feat of athleticism… gets 2 or 3 points. Since teams average over 100 points a game, there’s a limit to how impactful any one play can be until the last minutes of a game.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, each score in soccer is rare and thus hugely important. Unfortunately, goals are so infrequent that historically, over 30% of English league games end with neither team scoring more than once. Those rare goals are dramatic, but personally I find it difficult to get excited about the intervening dribbling and passing when I know it’s very unlikely to shape the final result.</p>



<p>It’s a tradeoff, and football’s rules situate it nicely between these extremes. There are typically around 8 scoring plays each NFL game, and even the non-scoring plays are impactful (see below).</p>



<h4>Building Progress / Tension</h4>



<p>Getting a player on base in baseball or softball, winning a game or a set in tennis’ Game/Set/Match structure, or defeating a video game monster and getting to heal at a save point — these smaller discrete goals build toward the larger one.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/static01.nyt.com/images/2009/01/01/sports/01chains.1.600.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for first down" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/static01.nyt.com/images/2009/01/01/sports/01chains.1.600.jpg?w=350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Football is designed to have two key ways to make non-scoring plays significant. First, teams are only given four chances (downs) to score before they turn the ball over to the other team — but the count is reset every time they gain another 10 yards. Every third-down and fourth-down opportunity has more importance because it’s approaching that impactful mini-goal, breathing more life into a drive.</p>



<p>But even without this ratcheting structure, non-scoring progress matters because field position is a ‘stateful’ element which persists from one play to the next. Where one play ends, the next one begins. Every yard one team moves forward is an extra yard the opponents will need to win back. It’s a tug-of-war with scoring opportunities on the line at any time.</p>



<h3>“Legacy” Narratives</h3>



<p>Legacy games are all the rage, and for good reason. (Our country even decided to LARP a game of Pandemic Legacy!)</p>



<p>The fact that players, teams, and coaches have storylines, rivalries, and arcs is a big part of the human element to football. We’re watching some of the legends of their craft face off each week, with history between them and human motivations.</p>



<p>On Sunday, we get to watch completely different quarterbacks compete: young phenom Patrick Mahomes against the unaging Tom Brady. Mahomes, who won last year, is widely considered one of the best in the league despite being only 25. In contrast, Brady is 43 and amazingly this is his <em>tenth</em> Super Bowl appearance. He’s been playing at an elite level for decades, and he won his first Super Bowl in 2002 — when Mahomes was 6.</p>



<p>Most of Brady’s 20 years were spent under coach Bill Belichick, known for being brilliant and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/10/10/17961082/chiefs-patriots-bill-belichick-press-conference-hyped" target="_blank">famously taciturn</a>. (Unless, of course, you ask him about the history and minutia of football kicking rules, which makes him light up and talk for ages.) However, last year Brady decided to leave Belichick and the New England Patriots, so people were wondering whether he could succeed with a different coach. He’s answered those questions in dramatic fashion. </p>



<p>When storylines carry over from campaign to campaign or season to season, it’s a great way to build long narratives of meaning and importance.</p>



<hr>



<p>Whether or not you enjoy watching the sport, there’s a lot it does well from a design perspective and I recommend anyone who enjoys strategy to try playing some of the Madden video games — how I initially got excited about the game.</p>

Use AI photo editing tools like Deep Art, an AI art generator like Deep Dream Generator, an AI image generator like Artbreeder (a.k.a. GANBreeder), an AI painting generator like AI Painter, a AI cartoon maker like Cartoonify, or draw with a neural network using Quick Draw. As tools to make AI art become more mainstream, AI artworks will increasingly embed themselves in our culture. We’re already seeing it in pop album covers, gracing traditional art gallery walls, within digital and pixel art, and expanding our notion of computer generated art. By mastering the tools to create AI generated art, and creating works while this field is in its infancy, you can help push the boundaries of human creativity forward.

      <h4>A look at trends from 100 weeks of AI news, and AI-generated AI news snippets!</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <p>With this week’s “Last Week in AI,” Skynet Today has just released its 100th edition of <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/">our weekly newsletter summarizing each week’s major AI news</a>! 
That’s almost 2 years of covering the developments in AI, sifting through the often noisy AI news landscape for important trends, while highlighting potential hypes and concerns.</p>

<p>To commemorate this occasion, we’re publishing a few notable statistics on these past 100 weeks.
And, for fun, we’ve fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on all the AI news articles we’ve covered so far to generate a few AI news snippets.</p>

    It seems like at least for the articles we collect, ones related to "robots" grew much faster than other areas.
    Note: keyword trends also count related terms - for example, "hardware" also counts mentions of "GPU"

<h2 id="ai-generated-ai-news-articles">AI-Generated AI News Articles</h2>

<p>We finetuned a GPT-2 model on the AI articles we linked throughout our newsletters to generate the follow AI news snippets.
While they’re written in the style of AI news, mentioning the appropriate keywords and phrases, they’re generally logically inconsistent and contain obvious factual errors.
For example, the first snippet mentions a researcher by the name of Atushi Sakamoto.
While this name does belong to a real researcher, in real life he is a Professor of Integrated Life Sciences at Hiroshima University, not someone studying AI at the University of Tokyo.
This is unsurprising given how these models work (see <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/gpt2">here</a>, <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/humans-not-concentrating">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/gpt3">here</a>).</p>

<p>But, reading these generated snippets can still be an interesting experience - some are as bad as others are hilarious:</p>

    <h5> Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars </h5> 
    <p><q>
    A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence: traffic lights. Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper. In research authored by Atsushi Sakamoto and colleagues at the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision Support in Tokyo, the team presents an efficient way to turn traffic lights on and off. In practice, however, identifying and setting the timing for lighting within a traffic space can prove difficult, as it’s often unpredictable and there may even be visual clues that indicate the start of a car ahead or the end of a short one. Sakamoto and colleagues came up with an efficiency-enabling solution based on approaches developed by researchers at Google, IBM, and Toyota.

    <h5> How I used NLP's GPT-3 to write the AI I Created </h5>
    <p><q>
    When it comes to creating AI, there are 2 main choices I have:- write a clean code or- just use the output from the original app to clean code. Either way, there are a lot of good articles and code examples on arxiv.com.The reason I choose the latter is both lovely and surprising: with a solid foundation of 30 lines of code (more on that later), this way of creating and using AI is fairly simple. I wanted a clean, sharp and concise writing experience that would let my coworkers and I take on difficult creative problems with clear writing. What I didn't expect was for the first part of the code to become a bottleneck, exposing the messiness of the AI. The second reason may be more complex: I was writing this sentence while driving, and as I was about to cross the street, I accidentally sent the car driving by on the bright day and ended up writing another code to keep driving. Despite its simplicity, the problem with GPT-3 is its inability to generate long sequences.

    <h5> AI researchers propose making chatbots and voice assistants more like their real-world peers </h5>
    <p><q> 
    Chatbots, which are a form of virtual personas, have long been the interface between human and machine. Advances in the past few years have democratized voice assistants, responding to the needs of multiple speakers at once, aiming to reduce set times and improve duration. But much of the field has proven difficult to apply conversational AI effectively in the real world, especially on sensitive tasks involving such as sales or customer service.To address this issue, a team from MIT Technology Review (MIT Tech Review) and Beijing-based research institute Beijing Brain Institute have developed a novel approach to training conversational AI systems on a dataset of short conversations over long periods of time. The researchers developed a chatbot named QUEBO after their lab name, which stands for QUEBO, "Quō-" or "QUE-BO." They say the research will serve as a benchmark to benchmark conversational AI’s capability to handle small conveniences like social media conversations in real time.

    <h5> Amazon to Retrain a Third of Its U.S. Workers as Automation Advances </h5>
    <p><q>
    So far, the American workforce has been largely in workers of color. But Amazon is about to ramp up hiring of some of its more 200,000 hourly workers, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. The new hires won’t be those in the same field as its more self-professed “white-collar workers,” as the company abbreviates its growing staff. Instead, the roughly 1,000 new workers will be drawn from two large and multiracial groups: Amazon has laid off thousands of Black and Latinx workers, has laid off dozens of Latinx employees, and is currently seeking Federal Employment Development money to pay for new workers. “Right now, the numbers of Black, Latinx, and African American workers are shrinking, because there’s still not enough talent available to continue these high-volume, high-pressure work,” the person familiar with Amazon’s plans explained. Amazon declined to comment on the more than 1,000 new positions it plans to employ.

    <h5> Meet Microsoft's first AI-powered coffee machine </h5>
    <p><q>
    Jeff Dean, chair of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) division, recently sat down with WIRED senior writer Will Knight to discuss the value of building products that do a lot of good, but don’t always do much of anything else. Dean tells WIRED that he thinks we’ll all need to find some sort of “general purpose product” — a conceptual mashup of software and hardware that completely reimagines the capabilities of a specific computer (or, more generally, a business) in order to tackle one task. It’ll probably require buy-in from product builders, analyst agnostics, human resources departments, call centers, product managers, and a few other well-intentioned minds, but Microsoft has a pretty good shot at that right now. Dean tells WIRED that while there’s certainly value in building product companies that “do something interesting,” they also need to do it in a way that can tackle customer needs.

            <p>Very interesting topic, isn't it? Many copies are broken, many different assumptions and reasoning. However, I have a printer ( <b>Epson l800</b>) worked out a huge resource (about <b>18 liters of ink</b>&nbsp; for almost 5 years). What is depressurization, I did not know. Although I am, in general, an ordinary user. Above the printer did not shake, prints, and okay. But, of course, sometimes he smeared some kind of oil from a spray, forgive me for such words :)</p>
<p>Cleansing launched with or without. He didn’t do deep, and he made sure that the ink crane was constantly open. In periods without printing, I wrapped it in a garbage bag for 120 liters (from dust). And in this form, he stood in the offseason. Some movements were made halfway along the path, I will write about this in detail in the next review.</p>
<p>Where did it all go? One of the readers of my site wrote to me that in the west there are no 6-color models with CISS. All officially announced four-color models. Malaysian and Indian models sold on Amazon are not taken into account. Of course, I am not a connoisseur of the European and American market, but a superficial search really did not reveal 6-color models.</p>
<p>Further seditious assumption was made: 4-color models are more reliable, because there are other inks. The thought is definitely not for the faint of heart. I have always considered the original 6-flower ink to be a very good product. Excellent color, good light fastness. But what can I say, to all who do not print much, I always advise original ink.</p>
<p>But the correspondent was very eloquent in his arguments (but he climbed through - he is a Siberian, they are persistent!). And actually, after a while, a thought popped into my head: who said that Epson is doing super-ink, especially for emerging markets?</p>
<p>All the information described below is a fantastic work of art about parallel universes, and has nothing to do with Seiko Epson Corporation.</p>
<h3>Epigraph:</h3>
<p>For every sage, quite simplicity. Now I understand that any crazy idea can lead to interesting results. And what you will do with these results is completely incomprehensible. If the experiment was originally intended for lighting, then of course, I would scan and photograph everything that was possible. And so, it was a brawl, for fun. Everything that was interesting was photographed by himself, that he did not, alas, have to take a word.</p>
<p>Again, I do not pursue the goal of exposing the evil bourgeoisie who staged a world conspiracy. Just for people with a brain, I think the published information will be useful, regardless of whether they agree with it or not.</p>
<p>If you throw back the heads, clogged with all kinds of incomprehensible ink, and another huge layer of GHGs killed while trying to reanimate 1-2 nozzles, then there are only two external signs of death of modern GHGs.</p>
<p><b>Death of PG No. 1</b>&nbsp; - This is very popular on the L800 and is called "head depressurization." <br><b>Death of PG No. 2</b>&nbsp; - It is very popular on expensive wide-format pigment devices from Epson Corporation. The story is usually very banal, everything was printed fine in the evening, in the morning there is no whole color channel.</p>
<p>So for starters, the popular question is: why does the printhead depressurize? The answer is simple, the “nozzle” plate is peeled off from the elements of the ink channels. More precisely, it does not completely peel off, but the sealant is torn. Next, the ink seeps into each other. The most classic case for the L800 is a mixture of cyan and manzhents.</p>
<p><b>The first symptoms of depressurization</b></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/duz1.jpg" width="100%"></p><p><b>Progressive Depressurization</b></p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/duz2.jpg" width="100%"></p><p>There are many assumptions: a very powerful pump, bad dampers, etc. But here are very very few votes, what can just the original ink does not fit? After all, the print head was not specifically developed for the L800.</p>
<p>Hooked the cans on the side and voila. Sales are growing, the percentage of defects under the guarantee is sane. And how many carcasses of printers lies in closets, this is sorry, not our Japanese business :)</p>
<p>This would happen to one of the alternative ink suppliers, would instantly fly out of the market. And then the company, you can’t argue, can’t it be better? Again, with models in 4 colors, even in Russia there is no such a massive percentage of marriage. And by the way, they have a larger guarantee, and the claimed resource, although the print head is clearly simpler.</p>
<p>I will try to model the process of peeling off the nozzle plate on my fingers using a simple everyday example. <br> It is easy to draw an analogy with some brands of glue for thermo-pistols, it is glued so that the figs are torn off, but a drop of alcohol is enough, and the whole adhesive seam just bounces off the part with a bang. Is there a similar process in the bowels of the printheads?</p>
<p>Correspondence with the Siberian sluggishly lasted more than six months, I have my own work. Well, there’s no time to do tests at all. But as always the case helped, they presented me to the murdered l800, I don’t know what was poured into it (most likely intek), but half of the nozzles were missing. He died in the office, due to standing on the window in the sun without work for a year. Forgotten about him corny. After washing, only the extreme canals fully came to life, but that was enough. After that, the idea arose to conduct testing.</p>
<h3>Why do you need this?</h3>
<p>The answer is simple, I want to get a wider Epson. Their prices have become not humane, but by reliability a lot of negativity in the network. Before spending his hard-earned money with many zeros, I decided to understand the issue more thoroughly.</p>
<p>For inexpensive, cyan was purchased from the L800 - it was poured into a living extreme channel. In the next one, as I was spending it, everything I had was: DCTEC (it was generally like shoe polish - they changed the party, which started flakes in the cold) and revolutions. In all other colors (capacities), a yellow disitek was poured, there were a lot of it :)</p>
<p>The test consisted in the fact that when I was not lazy, I ran a script that printed test pages from these two channels. Type 20 sheets A4 and cleaning in line. And so in a circle, printing in RPM mode matte paper. The paper was clearly inserted into the usual most deshmansky ala maiden.</p>
<p>Well, the result was not long in coming. After about 4 months and 5 vials of the original, the head lost its tightness between the channels.</p>
<p>I understand perfectly that the test is not complete, not clean, etc. But from the moment of depressurization of the GHG everything was shot from me. Dismantling the PG - it was interesting to me, I photographed everything. I think you will not find such detailed photos. On the Internet, a lot of nonsense is written about the printheads for Epson, many do not even understand in detail how they work. I wanted to close this question for myself once and for all.</p>

<p>Remove the seal on the ink channels</p>

<p>In this form, clean the GHG with especially severe blockages</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p04s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>We firmly throw off the connector board</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p05s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>As you can see, nozzles work in pairs on colors, i.e. 6 colors and 3 boards with piezo elements.</p>
<p>Remove the nozzle plate</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p22s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>It is useless to look for traces of sealant or something else on this plate, after a drop of washing and rubbing it is cleaned to a shine without any signs of ink exposure. By the way, traces of old ink were very well absorbed and did not wash off when washing the GHG. After rubbing the plate with his finger, it became a mirror. So that “hydrocephalus” is even “silly” with annual downtime. Those. the colors used to print the tests were washed with warm water, and what was before clogging was not removed without mechanical action.</p>
<p>Remove the nozzle plate</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p29s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>The front plate is made of a non-magnetic alloy, on the one hand there is clearly some kind of yellow spraying. On the other hand, under normal lighting, it looks like a stainless steel. But I clearly fell into a yellow tint, I did not want to change the light to normal, it was filmed as is. If you look closely at the foreground, ink traces are visible. But the color of the plate on the PG side is metallic.</p>
<p>GHG inspection</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p06s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>To go nuts, the membrane of the piezoelectric elements is eaten up like acid, of course, I touched it a little when I removed the plate, my hands are still crooked: (But look at the next frame.</p>
<p>GHG inspection</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p08s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>I took a toothpick and began to poke hard on the membrane in adjacent channels. Everything is normal, dense and very soft material (similar to silicone), it is difficult to break through. And in the extreme I just touched how the ashes all crumbled. Well I do not know. If I drove off the acid, and then the original ink, and not a long period of time. By the way, in this shot it was possible to select a wavelength well, and the sealant began to “phosphorize” in white. No obvious violations are visible anywhere.</p>
<p>Large channel plates</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p09s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>I show large channels of ink approach to nozzles, for those who have not yet understood these thin ribs of adjacent channels are glued with sealant (it was possible to highlight it well), the rib thickness is probably about 0.1 mm. And any violation of tightness will cause a violation of normal operation, at least kosostruy with the mutual influence of nozzles of different colors on each other. And in the worst case, a mixture of different colors. The sealant is tricky, more like glass, or polymerized UV glue, very hard, and a very thin layer, I think the thickness is only a few microns. I did not see any signs of separation from the GHG base between the channels. Most likely, the “snapping” of the adhesive layer occurs, as in the case with hot-melt adhesive. Although I tried to soak a couple more goals in solvent, acetone, etc. I was not able to dissolve this sealant. The front plate sat like a glove.</p>
<p>Another view of the channel plate.</p>

<p>He took off at an angle, and in other lighting, to illuminate the height of the edges. It is very funny to read about the masters who write, they …</p></div></div>

<p>Annual reports are part and parcel of every public company’s life. It is a document that the public corporations must provide annually to shareholders that describes their operations and financial conditions. In the U.S., companies typically file the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
One fine day, as I was following the internet rathole, I landed myself on the Netflix investor page for some reason. One thing to understand about these 10-K forms is that these are …. pretty basic. Imagine being transported back in time from the current beautifully designed web interfaces back to a text-based interface. This is what I was dealing with, and all the reports looked like these fine specimens from Facebook and Amazon.</p>

<p>2003 report begins with a <em>Netflix-DVD-in-the-mail</em> envelope design - very on-brand! It then plays on movie titles like Edward Scissorhands to explain benefits and features. Then, it ends with an infographic that makes it very easy to digest the annual numbers.</p>

<p>The 2004 report continues the tradition of a grand opening. It then uses direct integrations with famous movie characters like Spiderman, Austin Powers, and Frankenstein. This is my favorite report!</p>

<p>For the 2005 report, the focus seems to have been on the subscribers. I’m not sure if the profile pics are of the subscribers to Netflix at the time, but it’s very likely.
The now-defunct star-based rating system shows up as a way to represent horizontal bar charts. Somebody really put some serious thought into this design!</p>

<p>2006 is the first year when the design was toned down and only a couple of pages worth calling out. This report’s theme seems to be the mailbox and a mailbox bar chart that I can only describe as “atrocious.” What are they trying to do with the shadows? 🧐👀</p>

<p>2007, 2008, and 2009 are basically clones of each other. The design has been reduced to bare bones with only a couple of “designed” pages before the 10-K form. There are only a few pages worth calling out, but at least the bar charts are sensible and easily readable. 🎉</p>

The aim of the following piece is simply to share some interesting accounts of the tin-trade in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, particularly one written in Arabic and another in Persian. Taken together, these two accounts suggest that tin from southwestern England (<i>i.e.&nbsp;</i>Cornwall and Devon) was exported via southern France to both Egypt and ultimately Iran in this period, with it being used by potters in the latter area to make tin-opacified ceramic glazes.</p><div><div><p>The first account to be considered here is a short but intriguing section from the early fourteenth-century&nbsp;<i>Taqwīm al-buldān</i>, 'Survey of the countries' (1321), of Abū l-Fidāʾ, a Syrian prince of the Ayyūbid family, which offers both a general description of England and a short but intriguing section detailing the export of tin from England to Alexandria, Egypt, via southern France. The section that deals generally with England is explicitly derived from the earlier work of&nbsp;Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī, who was born born near Granada in 1213, lived for a time in Egypt, and died in 1286, and runs as follows:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>And the islands of Britain are eleven islands. Of the famous islands is the island of England (<i>Inkiltarah</i>). Ibn Saʿīd said: And the ruler of this island is called <i>al-Inkitār</i> in the <i>History of Salāḥ&nbsp;ad-Dīn (Saladin) in the wars of ʿAkkā (Acre)</i>. His capital in this island is the city of <i>Lundras </i>(London). He continued: And the length of this island from south to north, with a slight inclination, is 430 miles. Its width in the middle is about 200 miles. He continued: <b>And in this island are mines of gold, silver, copper, and tin</b>. There are no vines because of the sharpness of the frost. <b>Its inhabitants bring the precious metals of these mines to the land of France, and exchange them for wine.</b> The ruler of France has plentiful gold and silver from that source. In their country (sc. England) is made the fine scarlet wool of their sheep, which is fine like silk. They place coverings over the animals, to protect them from rain, sun, and dust. In spite of the wealth of <i>al-Inkitār</i> and the extent of his kingdom, he admits the sovereignty of <i>al-Farans</i><i>īs</i>&nbsp;(the French king), and when there is an assembly, he performs his service by presenting before (the ruler of France) a vessel of food, by ancient custom.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn1">1</a>)</p></blockquote><p>The mention here of mines that produce tin is noteworthy. The tenth-century Persian <i>Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam</i>, written for a prince of Gūzgan in northern Afghanistan in <i>c.&nbsp;</i>982, intriguingly describes Britain as an 'emporium' (<i>bārgāh</i>) of Spain (<i>Andalus</i>) and also makes mention of 'numerous mountains, rivers, villages, and different mines' in Britain, but doesn't specify the nature of these mines, unlike Ibn Saʿīd and Abū l-Fidāʾ.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn2">2</a>) Interestingly, the above description of the specific characteristics of the mines of England seems to have been picked up fairly rapidly by other authors aside from Abū l-Fidāʾ. For example, its influence can be seen in the&nbsp;<i>Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh</i> of Rashīd al-Dīn (completed in&nbsp;Īlkhānate-era Iran,&nbsp;<i>c.</i>&nbsp;1307–16), and in Banākatī's derivative&nbsp;<i>Rawżat ūli’l-albāb</i>,&nbsp;written in 1317 at Banākaṯ, Transoxiana (in present-day Tajikistan, Central Asia), although their description is expanded slightly to say that in <i>Anglater</i>—England—there are 'many remarkable mountains, innumerable mines of gold, silver, copper, tin, and iron, and different kinds of fruit.'(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn3">3</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>After the above general description of England, Abū l-Fidāʾ offers brief discussions of Ireland and of another Atlantic island where gyrfalcons and polar bears are said to be found (the former reportedly being popular with the Sultan of Egypt and the latter being said to have skin that is soft to the touch). Later on, however, he returns to the question of the export of metals from England when discussing Toulouse, France, in another section that is explicitly derived from the work of Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī:</p><blockquote><p>Ibn Said said: And to the east of Bordeaux is the city of Toulouse... The river (sc. Garonne) is south of it, and ships from the Encircling Ocean ascend it, with tin and copper, which they bring from the island of England and the island of Ireland. It is carried on pack-animals to Narbonne, and taken from there on the ships of the Franks to Alexandria.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn4">4</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, this statement is undoubtedly interesting, offering, as it does, good evidence for the long-distance export of tin from southwestern England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The first half of the route described here is certainly an ancient one, bearing a striking similarity to the tin route described by Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC (probably drawing on the lost account of Pytheas, a fourth-century BC traveller from Marseille). He says that those who dwell in southwestern Britain 'work the tin into pieces' and sell it to merchants who 'carry it from there across the Straits of Galatia or Gaul; and finally, making their way on foot through Gaul for some thirty days, they bring their wares on horseback to the mouth of the river Rhone'. Although the route described by the above Arabic account is slightly more detailed than that recorded by Diodorus, and obviously has an additional stage from France to Egypt, the coincidence is notable, and a find of a sixth-century cruciform brooch from eastern England in south-eastern France near to Castelnaudary, Aude (about midway along the route from Toulouse to the Mediterranean), arguably offers some confirmation that the same overland route from England to the Mediterranean was indeed in use in the intervening period too.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn5">5</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LA9ShHsnFc8/X8AbV7cybxI/AAAAAAADMBg/VR4mW-G9pEA_OTBQhJZpo5bDgwkm8meAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/14thC-Persian-tin-Jug-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="597" data-original-width="500" height="478" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jSQfeF5o0L8/X8AbVPJ2gwI/AAAAAAADMBc/jB-Be7EM_08qt5oLNuogahanX57kC3IYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/14thC-Persian-tin-Jug-500.jpg" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>A fourteenth-century, tin-glazed jug decorated with lustre and cobalt, made at Ray, Iran, and now in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro; click the image for a larger view (image: Caitlin Green).<br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The second, Persian account of the medieval tin trade is less specific about the source of the tin than this, but is nonetheless important. In particular, it offers us some idea of where a portion, at least, of the tin from southwestern England was transported to after it reached thirteenth-/fourteenth-century Egypt, as well as the purposes to which it might be put. The account itself is from a treatise on ceramics by Abū l-Qāsim Qāshānī of Kashan, Iran, that was written in <i>c.</i>&nbsp;1300–01, based on the date of the earliest, autograph manuscript. This treatise mentions the importation of tin to Iran from Western Europe or <i>Farangistān</i>, a name strictly meaning the land of the Franks (the French) that was applied generally to Western Europe north of the Iberian Peninsula:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The vessels, ingredients and materials which serve as raw materials for these people [manufacturers of tiles and other ceramic objects] are many... One of these is the form of tin called <i>raṣāṣ</i>. <u>Its mines are known in many places. The first is that from Farangistān.</u> In Farangistān it is cast in the form of pieces and stamped with a Farangī stamp <u>as prevention against adulteration</u>...(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn6">6</a>)</p></blockquote><p>The account then goes on to list two other sources of tin, one to the north of Iran (in the middle Volga area of modern Russia) and another to the east in 'China' (possibly Malaysia), before including details on how such tin could be used in the making of white and turquoise ceramic glazes.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn7">7</a>) Suffice to say, in the present context this account is of considerable interest. The tin from&nbsp;<i>Farangistān</i>&nbsp;mentioned here must have almost certainly originated in southwestern England, based on both what we know of tin production in this era and the above Arabic account of Abū l-Fidāʾ/Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī, with its reference to French merchants transporting English tin to Alexandria. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the tin from the middle Volga in Russia may also have ultimately come from England too, as there were no medieval native sources of tin in that region and tin does, in fact, seem to have been imported into Russia from England via Germany earlier in the medieval period.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn8">8</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9KT_vElMz1k/X8AcRscMyAI/AAAAAAADMB0/-tSBWeTbGMYi-3SWIDhx77h9oy7OzBvJQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2159/Two13thCBowlFrags-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="209" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UFD0U70naiA/X8AcRBf2k_I/AAAAAAADMBw/bE_2YVlhlkQTiUbO68Q_Jjw22whtXN5QgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Two13thCBowlFrags-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Two fragments of mina'i bowls probably made in the city of Kashan in the early thirteenth century, both featuring a tin-opacified glaze, now in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro; click the image for a larger view. The left bowl, TRURI 900.479, seems to show a young prince sitting cross-legged, whilst the right bowl, TRURI 900.478, shows a male equestrian figure (image: Caitlin Green).<br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In consequence, it can be said that the two main accounts under consideration here seem, when taken together, to suggest that tin from Cornwall and Devon was very probably making its way across to Iran in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, where it was used to create tin-opacified white and turquoise ceramic glazes by manufacturers of pottery and tiles. In this context, it is worth observing that Cornish or Devonshire tin was definitely used for a similar purpose in sixteenth-century Italy, and&nbsp;Anna McSweeney has recently argued that it was probably used for making opaque ceramic glazes in medieval Iberia too.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn9">9</a>) So, for example, in 1417 a potter named Hacen Muça was paid by a French merchant from Montpellier, Joan Lorenç, in lead, tin and cobalt to undertake work that he was to deliver to the port of Valencia in two months, presumably using tin obtained by this French merchant from southwestern England, and in 1325 another contract specifies that the potter Mahomet Bensuleyman and another <i>saracen&nbsp;</i>from Manises, eastern Spain, would be paid in advance with lead and tin for the kiln loads that they were to supply.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>Whether earlier Islamic ceramics using tin-opacified glazes similarly depended on tin from southwestern England is a matter of speculation, but it is interesting to observe that the earliest such glazes seem to have their origins in Egypt in the eighth century AD, which is perhaps suggestive, given that tin seems to have been known as 'the Brittanic metal' in Egypt only a century earlier.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn11">11</a>) Finally, it should be noted that the tin imported into Iran from medieval England was almost certainly used for purposes other than the creation of ceramic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> <div> <div>  <p>Paul Graham has an <em>idée fixe</em> somewhere in the area of the Hacker as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">solitary artist</a>, visionary, creative. I disbelieve anything PG says as a matter of principle. <a href="https://idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm">Maciej</a> is a more reliable source when it comes to painting.</p> <p>And yet. Surely there is a fundamental creativity when it comes to <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a>.</p> <p>I experience inspiration, certainly, and the lack of it.</p> <p>I experience a degree of creative fulfillment comparable to what I get when I compose music or poetry.</p> <p>I experience aesthetic pleasure when I write good code, and use an aesthetic, intuitive sense to guide me in the code I write.</p> <p>So, it’s not a dead, mechanistic art.</p> <p>So let’s start with something that’s hard to dispute from Maciej:</p> <blockquote> <p>So just like mechanical engineers and architects, computer programmers create artifacts that have to stand up to an objective reality. No one cares how pretty the code is if the program won’t work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thinking of mechanical engineers—or civil, really: did Isambard Kingdom Brunel design bridges for fun? That is, can we reasonably assume that Brunel ever designed a bridge because he felt like it, because he wanted to feel the pleasure of creation?</p> <p>Almost certainly, yes. If I were Isambard I can only assume I’d be sketching bridges all day.</p> <p>So then: did Brunel ever <em>build</em> bridges for fun?</p> <p>Almost certainly not. A bridge is an expensive, rather large undertaking, that requires a lot of other people to make things or maneuver those things into place. And once they’re their they tend to be relatively difficult to unmake.</p> <p>Maybe this points us in a smarter direction. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, I must simply assume, an inherently, maybe even brilliantly, creative individual. The difference between <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> and bridge-building—<em>one</em> difference between <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> and bridge-building—is that the economics of <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> allow for a practice of engineering as <em>pure</em> recreation and <em>pure</em> creation. The use of the artifact—how it exists in the world and the function it performs and maybe even the utility it grants others—is still fundamental. But this too can be realized from a purely creative perspective. When it comes to bridges, on the other hand, their nature is <em>also</em> inherently creative; it’s just that the economics of them and the rather ineluctable nature of constructed things to take up space and impede the presence of <em>other</em> things prevents them in all but the most extreme conditions from being purely so.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

            <p>I was asked to give a toast in celebration of the 50th Anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a> so I spent some time reflecting on Engelbart's work. </p>
<p>Most of the commentary on his work is focused on the technical achievements and the impressive feats of engineering that's genuinely 50 years ahead of its time. Just this week we, at Repl.it, we introduced Multiplayer -- the ability to code together with anyone in the world -- and although we have the benefits of modern tooling and infrastructure it was still hard work</p>
<p>A more interesting question to ask would be: "What's Douglas Englebart's generation function?" In other words, what ideas, themes, and philosophies that have inspired his groundbreaking work?</p>
<p>I didn't have much time to work with, so I had to go mostly of off memory -- this question requires a more in-depth examination. However, I've identified three themes that are worth studying. </p>
<h2 id="computers-as-mind-extenders">Computers as mind extenders</h2>
<p>Engelbart and his contemporaries saw computers as first and foremost tools for mind extension. Something we can use to augment our intellect to take on more and do more. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By augmenting human intellect we mean increasing the capability of man to approach complex problem situation to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean mixture of the following: more rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining useful degree of comprehension in situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble." -- <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human Intellect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sits in stark contrast to today's computers as the driver for the attention economy. Where computers as seen as entertainment devices at best. A more cynical reading of the way governments and ad-based businesses use computers would lead you to believe they're devices of control.</p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-design">Evolutionary design</h2>
<p>To understand Engelbart it's important to not view him as a lone inventor genius a la Tesla that predicted what computers could do 50 years ahead of his time. In his own words you can see that they took a much more exciting approach to discovery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're pursuing this monstrous goal by building and trying <em>empirically</em> -- we approach evolutionary-wise because we feel it's a whole system problem [...] it's much more than these computer tools"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>"Bootstrapping" is another recurring theme in Engelbart's work. I think of it as "increasing returns":</p>
<ul>
<li>You build tools, and then the tools you built helps you create better tools. </li>
<li>Tools make you smarter, and you make better tools that make you smarter... ad nauseam. </li>
<li>Tools increase productivity which makes us wealthier which in turn allows us to invest in more and better tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that what seemed to drive Engelbart was his concern for the unique challenges an exponentially changing world brings. He believed that <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned-original/2004-augment-133319-augmenting-society's-collective-iqs.pdf">"boosting Collective IQ"</a> is imperative for the flourishing of humanity.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, at least in my circles, there's a general feeling that we need to return to the thinking of computers as "bicycles for the mind." And I hope we do.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Figma and Dylan Field for inviting me to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Figma-SF/events/cwsnhqyxqbmb/">reflect</a> on this awesome day.</em></p>

        <p>I've frequently said that for web apps to compete effectively in the world of
apps, they need to be integrated in to all of the places that users expect apps
to be. Inter-app communication is one of the major missing pieces of the web
platform, and specifically one of the last major missing features is native
level sharing: Web apps need to be able to get <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/unintended-silos/">data out of their
silo</a> and into other web sites and apps; they also need to
be able to receive the data from other native apps and sites.</p>
<p>The File Share Target API is a game-changer of an API that is now in Chrome
Canary. The API extends the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target/blob/master/docs/explainer.md">Web Share Target
API</a>
that lets apps and sites share simple links and text to web sites by integrating
them into the systems sharing functionality.</p>
<p>This very static file blog utilizes the Web Share Target API so I can quickly
<a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/web-share-target-api/">share links</a> that I find interesting to it from any
Android application, and as of last week <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/testing-file-share-target-from-camera/">I enabled the File Share Target API so
that I can upload images to my blog directly from the Camera app on
Android</a>. This post is all about how I
did it (and stole some code from Jake Archibald — tbf he worked out a lot
of the bugs for an integration they are doing in to
<a href="https://squoosh.app/">squoosh.app</a>.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wicg.github.io/web-share-target/level-2/#example-3-manifest-webmanifest">File Share Target
API</a>
is a very novel API in that it is fully progressive. If your application can
handle Form <code>POST</code> requests then you can integrate easily with this API. The
basic flow is: when the user chooses your application from the native picker,
Chrome will send a Form <code>POST</code> request to your server, it is up to you what you
do with it (handle in a service worker or on the server).</p>
<p>To add support for sharing files into your web app you need to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare support for sharing files via the manifest file,</li>
<li>Handle the Form <code>POST</code> request in your Service Worker.</li>
</ol>
<p>The manifest declares to the host system how Sharing should be mapped from the
host application to the web app. In the manifest below it essentially says "When
a user shares a file of type 'image/*' make a Form POST request to
'/share/image/' and name the data 'file'".</p>
<p><em>manifest.json</em></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="JSON">{
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Blog: Share Image"</span>,
  <span>"short_name"</span>: <span>"Blog: Share Image"</span>,
  <span>"start_url"</span>: <span>"/share/image/"</span>,
  <span>"theme_color"</span>: <span>"#000000"</span>,
  <span>"background_color"</span>: <span>"#000000"</span>,
  <span>"icons"</span>: [ {
      <span>"sizes"</span>: <span>"192x192"</span>,
      <span>"src"</span>: <span>"/images/me.png"</span>,
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"image/png"</span>
  }],
  <span>"share_target"</span>: {
    <span>"action"</span>: <span>"/share/image/"</span>,
    <span>"method"</span>: <span>"POST"</span>,
    <span>"enctype"</span>: <span>"multipart/form-data"</span>,
    <span>"params"</span>: {
      <span>"files"</span>: [
        {
          <span>"name"</span>: <span>"file"</span>,
          <span>"accept"</span>: [<span>"image/*"</span>]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  <span>"display"</span>: <span>"standalone"</span>,
  <span>"scope"</span>: <span>"/share/"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Once the user shares to your web application, Chrome will make the web request
to your site with the file data as the payload.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you handle the POST request inside your service worker so
that 1) it is fast, 2) resilient to the network not being available. You can do
this as follows:</p>
<p><em>serviceworker.js</em> - <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/share/image/sw.js">demo</a></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Javascript"><span>onfetch</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> (<span>event</span>) =&gt; {
  <span>if</span> (<span>event</span>.<span>request</span>.<span>method</span> <span>!==</span> <span>'POST'</span>) <span>return</span>;
  <span>if</span> (<span>event</span>.<span>request</span>.<span>url</span>.<span>startsWith</span>(<span>'https://paul.kinlan.me/share/image/'</span>) <span>===</span> <span>false</span>) <span>return</span>;

  <span>/* This is to fix the issue Jake found */</span>
  <span>event</span>.<span>respondWith</span>(<span>Response</span>.<span>redirect</span>(<span>'/share/image/'</span>));
  
  <span>event</span>.<span>waitUntil</span>(<span>async</span> <span>function</span> () {
    <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>event</span>.<span>request</span>.<span>formData</span>();
    <span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>self</span>.<span>clients</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>event</span>.<span>resultingClientId</span> <span>||</span> <span>event</span>.<span>clientId</span>);
    <span>// Get the data from the named element 'file'
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'file'</span>);

    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'file'</span>, <span>file</span>);
    <span>client</span>.<span>postMessage</span>({ <span>file</span>, <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>'load-image'</span> });
  }());
};
</code></pre></div><p>There are a couple of interesting things happening above, which can quickly
summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render the UI as the result of the <code>POST</code> request by performing a redirect.</li>
<li>Read the data that is submitted via the form via <code>event.request.formData()</code></li>
<li>Send the data to the open window (this will be the UI that we redirected the
user to in the first point).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is entirely up to you what you do with the data that has been posted to your
service worker, but in the case of my App I needed to show it directly in the UI
so I have to find the window the user is using and <code>postMessage</code> the data there.</p>
<p><em>index.html</em> - <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/share/image/index.html">demo</a></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Javascript"><span>navigator</span>.<span>serviceWorker</span>.<span>onmessage</span> <span>=</span> (<span>event</span>) =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>event</span>);
  <span>imageBlob</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span>.<span>data</span>.<span>file</span>;
  <span>// Update the UI with the data that has been shared to it.
</span><span></span>  <span>imageShare</span>.<span>src</span> <span>=</span> <span>URL</span>.<span>createObjectURL</span>(<span>imageBlob</span>);
};
</code></pre></div><p>And that's about it. If you already have an API endpoint for your web forms,
then this is a simple, yet powerful addition that you can make to your site.</p>
<p>The Web Share Target API incredibly powerful platform primitive that breaks down
another barrier that web apps have had on their host platforms.</p>

February 5, 2021 | https://unintendedconsequenc.es/destructive-collection/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unintendedconsequenc.es/destructive-collection/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-287">
		<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	<div>
		<p><em>Some destruction is accidental. Some is intentional. Destruction works in different ways. And for different reasons.</em></p>
<p><em>These are types of destruction I’ve cataloged. I arranged this list according to&nbsp;what each type of destruction means, methods to achieve, first-order effects, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/blog/">second-order effects</a>, and examples.</em></p>
<p><em>(Reminder: first-order effects are the direct, commonly noticeable changes. Second-order effects are the effects of the effects and often not obvious.)</em></p>
<p><em>Note that there is a lot of overlap between categories. I didn’t attempt a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive list. That just felt unrepresentative of the messiness of life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This is a destructive collection that I hope will change the way you think. </em><span id="more-287"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Was Good (or Neutral). Now is Bad.</strong></h3>
<p>Social, political, religious, health, or other change that negatively impacts the way we perceive an item or practice. Destruction achieved through bullets, fire, bombs, hammers, words, shame, bans.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: Destroyed items, scattered artifacts, shame on those who do not change.</li>
<li>Second-order: Some items always remain. Guided “social evolution” occurs. Future backlash against the destruction. Creation of markets for artifacts which can fund the groups that ban them.</li>
<li>Examples: Cultural Revolutions in China, Iran, Cambodia, USSR, and more. In China during the Cultural Revolution of 1966 – 1976 the Four Olds (Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Ideas) were destroyed in displays of patriotism. With those displays went lots of artwork, architecture, and artifacts. For a glimpse into the beginning of this process (though not specifically about artifacts), read this article from <a href="https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/peking-review/1966/PR1966-36m.htm">1966</a>. In Cambodia, a related process started when the Khmer Rouge rolled the clock back to Year Zero, in order to destroy old society and rebuild it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Khrushchev’s anti-religious campaign destroyed 10,000 churches in the Soviet Union. Taliban bombing of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan. Savonarola’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_of_the_vanities">Bonfire of the Vanities</a>” in Florence. Religious-related destruction is a long list, especially when different groups clash over power. Other examples include destruction of Shia or Sunni (depending on location) mosques in the middle east. Mayan codices were destroyed by a Spanish priest. Taoist Emperor Wuzong had thousands of Bhuddist temples destroyed in China and Emperor Shizong had Bhuddist statues melted down to mint coins. Recently, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/chinese-authorities-continue-to-destroy-mosques-in-xinjiang-09072018171910.html">5,000 mosques</a> have been destroyed in Xinjiang province, China.</p>
<h3><strong><span>Damnatio Memoriae</span></strong></h3>
<div dir="auto">
<p>Erase memory of one who committed an extreme act (often for the purpose of gaining fame for themselves). Erasure of the actor’s existence, penalty for speaking of the person. Occurs as a top-down act rather than bottom-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: Prevent others from committing similar acts.</li>
<li>Second-order: Memory can remain longer because the damnatio memoriae penalty is incurred. Hard to actually achieve. Also hard to know when successful.</li>
<li>Examples: <a href="http://www.ancientpages.com/2017/01/06/herostratic-fame-relates-herostratus-burned-beautiful-temple-artemis-become-famous/">Herostratus</a> (burned down the Temple of Artemis), and a range of deposed or cruel Roman and Egyptian emperors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern examples include the downplay of celebrity suicides so that others do not copy them.&nbsp;The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide">Werther effect</a>” increases suicides in others after a widely publicized (often celebrity) suicide. The effect is named after Goethe’s novel <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8897665">Kurt Cobain</a> shot and killed himself in 1994, his widow went on TV to say that what he did was wrong. Cobain’s death then did not result in others’ killing themselves. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5802858/">Robin William’s suicide</a> 20 years later, however, did result in more deaths as the story spread widely.</p>
<h3><strong>Orwellian</strong></h3>
<p>Purposely change recorded history for political aims. Erase individuals from images and books, intentionally change the historical record for political goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order:&nbsp;Impact memory, at least generational memory.</li>
<li>Second-order: Behavior control. Widespread tacit understanding of acceptable behavior and people. Creation of groups of underground defiance.</li>
<li>Examples: Soviet Union <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/08/long-before-photoshop-the-soviets-mastered-the-art-of-erasing-people-from-photographs-and-history-too.html">editing</a> people out of photos for political purposes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union">Trotsky</a> removed from this image of Lenin speaking), Chinese (and other) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/people-who-were-erased-from-history-2013-12#leon-trotsky-russian-revolutionary-3">Communist Party</a> editing people out of photos. Kundera’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Laughter_and_Forgetting">literary image</a> of Czech leader Vlado Clementis’ hat, which is all that remains in a photo after he was edited away.</li>
</ul>
<p>I categorize this differently than damnatio memoriae, unlike others.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Forgetting</strong></h3>
<p>Memory-stored value starts to disappear. Natural process.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order:&nbsp;The collective loses access to this knowledge.</li>
<li>Second-order:&nbsp;The collective is freed from this knowledge, can reinvent this knowledge.</li>
<li>Examples: Go back several generations and common knowledge of the time would bewilder people today. Common knowledge of certain languages such as Latin and Greek in the West. Local <a href="http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/">languages die out</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge of how to hunt, sew, wash (without running water), start a fire without matches, prepare parchment and ink, raise animals, butcher animals, stay alive in extreme weather. Compare how some remote island communities survived otherwise destructive tsunamis while more modern communities that lost that knowledge suffered more.</p>
<h3><strong>Destruction is Creation</strong></h3>
<p>When the act of destruction creates something else, including a new appreciation for the item destroyed.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order:&nbsp;Focus is on the new and on the loss of the old.</li>
<li>Second-order: Freedom from the past.&nbsp;Art.</li>
<li>Examples: Ai Weiwei’s triptych of him <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/arts-curriculum/topic/ai-weiwei">dropping</a> a Han Dynasty vase (“It’s powerful only because someone thinks it’s powerful and invests value in the object”). Another artist, Miranda Stearn, list of items she would <a href="https://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/57870">destroy</a>, except if someone intervened.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Intimidation</strong></h3>
<p>When enough fear preempts creation. That is, intimidation’s aim is to prevent a future need to destroy by blocking creation in the present.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: Fear is enough to prevent undesired actions.</li>
<li>Second-order: The intimidated can change the game.</li>
<li>Examples: Language prohibitions, including against <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-rebirth-of-catalan-how-a-once-banned-language-is-thriving-47587">Catalan</a> and <a href="https://thebluereview.org/saving-basque-language-euskara/">Euskera</a>, languages which survived and grew after their bans. The Dalai Lama may change the game and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-dalai-lama-reincarnation-20141219-story.html">not reincarnate</a>. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/china-says-panchen-lama-living-a-normal-life-20-years-after-disappearance">Panchen Lama</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Panchen_Lama_controversy">controversy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Accident</strong></h3>
<p>Unexpected conditions arise that lead to destruction.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: We couldn’t prevent it.</li>
<li>Second-order: We did not want to deal with the costs of preventing this destruction. We did not appreciate the complexity that led to this destruction.</li>
<li>Examples: Establishment of the backup&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault">seed vault</a> in Norway, which had been specifically located at a point on the Earth’s surface beyond the risk of ice thaw. This seed vault <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/19/arctic-stronghold-of-worlds-seeds-flooded-after-permafrost-melts">flooded</a> shortly after it was built. Use of the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine during the Greece’s war with Turkey. A mortar round destroyed much of the historic building.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Apathy</strong></h3>
<p>Destruction out of a lack of care, either active or passive. Achieved when rarity and value is seen as common and without value.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: The loss of the items themselves.</li>
<li>Second-order: From our reaction we learn the items’ value only later.</li>
<li>Examples: Graffiti. Broken windows.&nbsp;The recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio">Brazilian</a> national museum <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/news-museu-nacional-fire-rio-de-janeiro-natural-history/">fire</a>&nbsp;was possible because of apathy. Brazil was formerly a relatively rich country when it collected most of these museum items, but in more recent decades became poorer and more corrupt. The museum which was known to need fire protection upgrade went for years without it and also lacked a operational budget. The disaster became inevitable. Similarly, fire destroyed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/massive-fire-guts-delhis-natural-history-museum">Delhi’s</a>&nbsp;poorly maintained natural history museum in 2016.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/10/18/237103122/scout-leaders-who-toppled-ancient-rock-may-face-charges">Monument Valley</a> destruction by former scout leaders. An active destruction where the perpetrators had no care for the items destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Cost-Based Theoretical</strong></h3>
<p>This type of destruction occurs when it is prohibitively expensive to retrieve an item. The item still exists, but its retrieval remains too expensive and is thus deemed theoretically destroyed. The item may be completely lost in the time that it takes cost to decrease or value to increase, if these factors change at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: The item still exists.</li>
<li>Second-order: Without a reason to incur the cost, the item s counted as destroyed. Costs and value determine survival. Cost and value can change unpredictably, especially for value.</li>
<li>Examples: E-discovery used where there is a legal proceeding or military intelligence needed. Expensive (locally determined) medical treatments that could save a life but are not chosen.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Location-Based Theoretical</strong></h3>
<p>Unknown whether items exist until they have been found. Only search will determine their existence.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: We should search for items.</li>
<li>Second-order: We only search for items if we believe there is value to them, yet we can’t know that until we search and find.&nbsp;What do we search for?</li>
<li>Examples: First <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/the-first-dinosaur-fossil-was-discovered-before-we-had-a-word-for-dinosaurs-curiosity/">dinosaur fossil</a> discoveries. Abandoned storage units. Buried treasure.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Mimetic</strong></h3>
<p>Imitative items and acts have power to control and destroy so they are feared and banned. Achieved through imitations of what we wish to destroy.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: Humans fight because we are different.</li>
<li>Second-order:&nbsp;Humans fight because we are similar.</li>
<li>Examples: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard">René Girard’s</a> work. Twins are considered bad luck in some cultures, killed, or one is put up for adoption. Voodoo dolls. Anything (such as hair or a business card) belonging to the person targeted for destruction is then itself attacked. Prohibitions against images, photographs, artwork representing human forms or specific people.&nbsp;Intentional violence toward a scapegoat strengths a group.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Replacement</strong></h3>
<p>Top-down efforts, often by religious and governmental institutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>First-order: Replacement is to remove a new generation’s ability to learn and remember.</li>
<li>Second-order:&nbsp;Replacement is strength.</li>
<li>Examples: Replacement of a religion, language, or custom with another. Mexico City Cathedral sits on the Mayan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_Mayor">Templo Mayor</a> that it replaced. Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia were formerly Hindu and then converted to Buddhist.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>&nbsp;mosque in Istanbul is a converted church. Egyptian iconography incorporated into early Christian themes (the Christian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_Madonna">Madonna and Child</a> is a replacement of Egyptian <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4113">Isis and Horus</a>).

<p>I guess most of you know the feeling that some code is not completely optimal.
It probably doesn’t matter much in practice, because there are more expensive
things around somewhere else, but the feeling when looking at it and thinking
„well, there must be some better way“. And then you go on a war with the code to
come up with something that is hopefully still readable, but somewhat better in
whatever metric you’re obsessing with at the time.</p>

<p>I often declare these kinds of wars on unneeded copies and allocations.
Talking to the global allocator is not exactly cheap and making extra copies is
just not elegant. Sometimes it means using a <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo">bump allocator</a>, or even
writing an <a href="https://docs.rs/bumpalo-herd">extension for it</a>. Sometimes it means extensive use of
borrowing. Now I have a long-standing battle with few of these allocations in
a service I work on in my day job. There seems to be a possibility this one will
finally get resolved and here goes a description how.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-code-does">What the code does</h2>

<p>The service accepts requests over HTTP. The POST body is protobuf encoded.</p>

<p>The HTTP part is taken care of by <a href="https://hyper.rs/">hyper</a>. For the protobuf, I’ve chosen
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a>, mostly because it makes the generated API look more like Rust than Java
and because it Just Works without any hassle around installing plugins. And it
seems popular too, which means it hopefully won’t fall into disrepair any time
soon.</p>

<p>The code currently looks something like this (I’m replacing the specifics with a
phone-book example and simplifying):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Entry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>optional</span> <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>optional</span> <span>string</span> <span>phone</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>optional</span> <span>string</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>message</span> <span>Batch</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>repeated</span> <span>Entry</span> <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>phonebook_submit</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>:</span> <span>Request</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Body</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>limits</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Limits</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code works. But I have this itching that it allocates and copies data
around needlessly. Let’s look where.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-whole-http-body">Collecting the whole HTTP body</h2>

<p>First it accumulates the whole body into a <code>Vec</code>, because <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> doesn’t allow
parsing incrementally (it can <a href="https://docs.rs/prost/0.7.*/prost/trait.Message.html#method.merge"><code>merge</code></a>, but this won’t handle a field spanning
across the buffer boundary). So every time we receive a request, new <code>Vec</code> is
allocated and the data are copied into it. This allocates at least one, but may
reallocate to accommodate longer multi-chunk requests.</p>

<p>In practice, most requests are short and fit into a single chunk. And <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a>
doesn’t need a <code>Vec</code>, using the chunk directly would be fine. The type of the
chunk is <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a>, which implements <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a>, which is what the parser wants. So
we could somehow check if the body is indeed in a single chunk and have two
branches of the code, one that uses it directly and the other handling the
longer bodies with a <code>Vec</code>. But that would make the code harder to read.</p>

<p>We could at least reuse the <code>Vec</code> between requests and not allocate every time.
But we would still be copying the bytes around.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> trait allows implementations to be non-continuous. That is, it
doesn’t have to be one big slice, it can be a sequence of shorter ones. So if we
could instead just chain the chunks and create a one <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> that represents
their sequence, everything would be nice and shiny.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.14.*/hyper/body/fn.aggregate.html">aggregate</a> function in <a href="https://hyper.rs/">hyper</a> actually does pretty much that, but it has
three disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It returns <code>impl Buf</code> instead of concrete type. <a href="https://hyper.rs/">hyper</a> in general has the
habit of not wanting to give me concrete types, which makes it harder to pass
the values around or store them (it pollutes code with generics, requires
dynamic dispatch and boxing in traits ‒ which is <em>another</em> allocation I don’t
want to have).</li>
  <li>I want to have that defensive check of how much data I’ve received from the
client and abort it before all RAM is consumed. It seems the <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.14.*/hyper/body/fn.aggregate.html">aggregate</a> will
just consume everything, no matter how large the payload is. Checking some
kind of <code>Content-Length</code> header first doesn’t help, because with a chunked
encoding it is not mandatory. If one uses <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.14.*/hyper/body/fn.aggregate.html">aggregate</a> in the server, a
malicious client can just kill the server by sending too much data.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t provide the other optimization I describe below at the moment (I’ve
went to check the code). Though I might submit a PR to fix this, it should be
quite simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the above reasons, I’ve decided to roll my own type that is basically a
bunch of <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a>s chained together (well, actually, I have two slightly
different ones) and publish it in the <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes-utils/">bytes-utils</a> crate. See the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes-utils/0.1.*/bytes_utils/struct.SegmentedSlice.html"><code>SegmentedSlice</code></a>, which can be built on top of some <a href="https://docs.rs/smallvec/1.*/smallvec/struct.SmallVec.html"><code>SmallVec</code></a> of chunks.
That way if only few chunks arrive (we expect just one), we don’t do any extra
allocation on top the one that <a href="https://hyper.rs/">hyper</a> does to create the chunks.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>chunks</span> <span>=</span> <span>SmallVec</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>[</span><span>Bytes</span><span>;</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<h2 id="allocations-to-fill-the-protobuf-messages">Allocations to fill the protobuf messages</h2>

<p>By default, the structures generated by <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> will look something like this
(I’m not including bunch of attributes it puts on them, they are not interesting
right now):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Entry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>phone</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Batch</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Entry</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each non-empty <code>Vec</code> or <code>String</code> is another separate allocation. In the case of
the strings that come from the input, they are just copied from there. In theory
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> could also borrow from the input data ‒ do something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Entry</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it could just point into the input data instead of allocating and copying.
But that would make working with the structures and the whole API more hairy, so
the suggestion to allow that was turned down.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a different feature is in progress. At the bottom, there’s the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html#method.copy_to_bytes"><code>copy_to_bytes</code></a> method from the <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes">bytes</a> crate. If the type this is called on
is <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a>, it’ll not allocate new instance and copy the bytes. The <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a>
type is something like <code>Arc&lt;[u8]&gt;</code> on steroids and it can hand out owned
sub-slices of itself (increment the reference count, but point to subset of the
original allocation). So <code>Bytes::copy_to_bytes</code> will just subslice itself and
hand out that without copying. That’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> can take advantage of it, with the <a href="https://docs.rs/prost-build/0.7.*/prost_build/struct.Config.html#method.bytes"><code>bytes</code></a>
configuration method. For now this works only for <code>bytes</code> fields in the
protobuf, but it seems some form of support is coming for strings too.</p>

<p>OK, so if we fast-forward to some future release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a>, we will likely get
this struct instead (if we explicitly ask for it):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct Entry {
    name: Option&lt;Bytes&gt;,
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, when parsing, it’ll call this <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html#method.copy_to_bytes"><code>copy_to_bytes</code></a> method. If the original
input is something like <code>&amp;[u8]</code>, it’ll just copy the bytes into a new
allocation, but if the original input is also <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a>, it’ll just slice &amp;
increment the reference count instead, which is cheap. Almost like the original
idea with borrowing from the input, but without any annoying lifetimes around.</p>

<p>But, isn’t our input some kind of <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes-utils/0.1.*/bytes_utils/struct.SegmentedSlice.html"><code>SegmentedSlice</code></a>? It is, but I’ve taken the
care to also support the same optimization, at least where possible. If the
whole request (one call to <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/trait.Buf.html#method.copy_to_bytes"><code>copy_to_bytes</code></a>) can be fullfilled by a single
buffer, then it delegates to that one. If the underlying buffers are <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a>
(like in our example above), it’ll use their optimized version. Unfortunately,
if the request is across a buffer boundary, then there’s no option but to
allocate &amp; copy. However, given that we usually expect to have just one chunk
(so there aren’t multiple buffers to start with) and even if there are, each
boundary can “kill” only one string/byte string, we have improved the situation
by a lot.</p>

<h2 id="but-string-is-more-comfortable-to-use-than-bytes">But <code>String</code> is more comfortable to use than <code>Bytes</code></h2>

<p>If the generator can create structures with <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a> in it, it helps the
allocations. But that loses all the fancy string manipulation methods, like
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.lines"><code>lines</code></a>, because it deals with arbitrary byte arrays.</p>

<p>For that reason, the crate I’ve publish also contains the [<code>Str</code>] type. It’s a
thin wrapper around the <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/1.*/bytes/struct.Bytes.html"><code>Bytes</code></a> type, but dereferences to <code>&amp;str</code> and puts all
the methods back.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it adds few methods of its own. Many of the string methods return
sub-slices of <code>&amp;str</code>. But these are borrowed and therefore introduce lifetimes
into whatever structures they are put into. So there are few analogue methods
(like <a href="https://docs.rs/bytes-utils/0.1.*/bytes_utils/string/struct.StrInner.html#method.lines_bytes"><code>lines_bytes</code></a>) that return more instances of [<code>Str</code>] instead of <code>&amp;str</code>.
These are still cheap to make (slightly less cheap than the <code>&amp;str</code>, but it is
only one reference count away) while providing an owned value.</p>

<p>I don’t know if <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> will eventually allow some way to fully customize which
types it should generate ‒ that would, additionally, allow using some <code>SmallVec</code>
instead of <code>Vec</code> for <code>repeated</code> fields, to save allocations in case only few
values are present. If it would, it should be possible to have structs with
<code>name: Option&lt;Str&gt;</code> in them. If not, it is still possible to create the <code>Str</code>
from <code>Bytes</code>, even though that would be less convenient.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-help">Does it help?</h2>

<p>Since the part where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> replaces <code>String</code> with <code>Bytes</code> isn’t available yet,
I haven’t integrated this into the service. So I don’t know if it makes it in
any way …</p></section></div></div>

  <p>Adding gaps between items became really easy with the introduction of the <code>gap</code> attribute for Grid layouts around 2018. And at the time of writing, <code>gap</code> is also supported for Flexbox layouts by <a href="https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap">most major browsers, with the notable exception of Safari</a>.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, this is how <code>gap</code> works with Grid layouts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>And you’ll get the exact same experience with Flexbox layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>flex</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The main difference is that you can now combine it with <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>.</p>



<p>If you need support for Safari (and it’s early 2021) or older versions of Chrome and Firefox, you’ll have to resort to one of the many workarounds.</p>
      <h3 id="margins-on-everything-but-the-last-thing">
        
        
          Margins on everything but the last thing <a href="#margins-on-everything-but-the-last-thing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>This is easy to get right: every item gets a margin on the right except for the very last one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>:not</span><span>(</span><span>:last-child</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin-right</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>A drawback is that we can’t support potential wrapping items, since we would need a conditional bottom margin, and even then, the horizontal margins stop making sense:</p>


    
      <h3 id="the-lobotomized-owl">
        
        
          The lobotomized owl <a href="#the-lobotomized-owl">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>I’ve used this one the most. If I’m being honest, probably because of the memorable name. There are some advantages, though, but those are best explained by <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/">A List Apart</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>*</span> <span>+</span> <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin-left</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Sadly, the lobotomized owl doesn’t handle wrapping either:</p>


    
      <h3 id="hidden-negative-margins">
        
        
          Hidden negative margins <a href="#hidden-negative-margins">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>This one works by wrapping the layout with <code>overflow: hidden</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.wrapper</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>overflow</span><span>:</span> <span>hidden</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.boxes</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.boxes</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>flex</span><span>;</span>
  <span>flex-wrap</span><span>:</span> <span>wrap</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>-12px</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>-12px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>100%</span> <span>+</span> <span>12px</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>To illustrate why the wrapper is necessary, here it is without it:</p>



    
      <h3 id="flexible-grid">
        
        
          Flexible grid <a href="#flexible-grid">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>We can achieve a very similar result using a Grid layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span> <span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>auto-fill</span><span>,</span> <span>minmax</span><span>(</span><span>20%</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Why only “very similar”? <a href="https://github.com/rachelandrew/cssgrid-ama/issues/15">What can Flexbox do that Grid can’t?</a> Flexbox is content-driven and Grid is layout-driven. A wrapping layout with items of different computed sizes isn’t possible with Grid. Here’s the example from above repurposed to attempt an auto-sized, auto-wrapping layout. The items all end up with the same width:</p>

<div>
  <p>Raindrops on roses</p>
  <p>Whiskers on kittens</p>
  <p>Bright copper kettles</p>
  <p>Warm woolen mittens</p>
  <p>Brown paper packages tied up with strings</p>
  <p>These are a few of my favorite things</p>
</div>

<p>Here’s another attempt with <code>grid-auto-flow: column</code> and <code>white-space: nowrap</code> which unfortunately no longer features auto-wrapping columns:</p>

<div>
  <p>Raindrops on roses</p>
  <p>Whiskers on kittens</p>
  <p>Bright copper kettles</p>
  <p>Warm woolen mittens</p>
  <p>Brown paper packages tied up with strings</p>
  <p>These are a few of my favorite things</p>
</div>

<p>As mentioned in the beginning, this is trivial with <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.boxes</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>flex</span><span>;</span>
  <span>flex-wrap</span><span>:</span> <span>wrap</span><span>;</span>
  <span>gap</span><span>:</span> <span>12px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.box</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>flex</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>auto</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
  <p>Raindrops on roses</p>
  <p>Whiskers on kittens</p>
  <p>Bright copper kettles</p>
  <p>Warm woolen mittens</p>
  <p>Brown paper packages tied up with strings</p>
  <p>These are a few of my favorite things</p>
</div>

<p>If you manage to do this with Grid, please <a href="https://github.com/fnune/fnune.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2021-01-28-space-between-items-with-and-without-flexbox-gap.markdown">submit a pull-request to edit this post</a>! I’ll be happy to merge it and learn something new along the way.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to using <code>gap</code> with Flexbox. Especially once the next major version of Safari is released, which should include <a href="https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/267829/webkit">the Webkit changeset that added support for it</a>.</p>

  <p><span>20 Jul 2018</span></p><p>Disclaimer: I come from the Ruby community where Resque and Sidekiq are the major job queue implementations. This post is about my findinds outside of the “comfort zone” tech stack. I’ll use “job queue” and “message queue” terms in the post, but essentually I’m referring to the same thing: a list with pop and push operations.</p>

<p>I love playing with Clojure on my spare time and I stumbled upon a Redis library for Clojure which is called <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine" target="_blank">carmine</a>.</p>

<p>Reading the docs, I was surprised to see that it has built-in message queue implementation. It’s only about 300 LOC and <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/blob/master/src/taoensso/carmine/message_queue.clj" target="_blank">one file</a> which was easy to read and understand even at 5am after waking up from jet lag.</p>

<p>But I got even more excited when I saw how carmine’s design around Redis keys for building a message queue. Before we dive into it, let me show how Resque and Sidekiq (common job queue libraries in Ruby) use Redis.</p>

<p>See Redis keys that they rely on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>resque:queue:&lt;qname&gt; - set, job payload in JSON
resque:queues - set, list of available queues &lt;qname&gt;
resque:workers - set, list of active workers &lt;wid&gt;
resque:worker:&lt;wid&gt; - hash, { wid, job payload }
resque:worker:&lt;wid&gt;:started - key, timestamp
resque:workers:heartbeat - hash, { wid, timestamp }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a job is pushed to the <code>low</code> queue, the following Redis commands would be called:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SADD resque:queues low
LPUSH resque:queue:low &lt;job payload&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now a worker would start and take the job from the queue:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SET resque:worker:&lt;wid&gt;:started &lt;NOW&gt;
HSET resque:workers:heartbeat &lt;wid&gt; &lt;NOW&gt;

RPOP resque:quques:low # fetch job and the payload
HSET resque:workers:&lt;wid&gt; &lt;job payload&gt; # declare itself as working on the specific job
... execute the job handler
HREM resque:workers:&lt;wid&gt; # when the work is done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(forgive me if I missed any operations here!)</p>

<p>This design of keys in Redis was <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque/tree/v0.0.1" target="_blank">brought up</a> by Resque since the very beginning. Later, when Sidekiq came around, Mike Perham <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Resque-Compatibility" target="_blank">wanted</a> to preserve compatibility with Resque and used the same keys structure in Sidekiq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I try to make Sidekiq compatible with Resque where possible and appropriate; this makes it easy to try out Sidekiq for those who are already using Resque.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the very keys design that Resque and Sidekiq are using now in 2018 is coming back from Resque 0.0.1 in 2010.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a look at what carmine (the Clojure implementation) <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/blob/master/src/taoensso/carmine/message_queue.clj" target="_blank">offers</a>. Here is its keys structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:messages     - hash, {mid mcontent}.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:locks        - hash, {mid lock-expiry-time}.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:backoffs     - hash, {mid backoff-expiry-time}.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:nattempts    - hash, {mid attempt-count}.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:mid-circle   - list, rotating list of mids.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:done         - set, awaiting gc, requeue, etc.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:requeue      - set, for `allow-requeue?` option.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:eoq-backoff? - ttl flag, used for queue-wide
                                    (every-worker) polling backoff.
carmine:mq:&lt;qname&gt;:ndry-runs    - int, number of times worker(s) have
                                    burnt through queue w/o work to do.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>mid</code> is the “message id” in carmine’s terminology. You can think of it as a “job id” in Ruby land.</p>

<p>You’ll soon start noticing how much different is this approach when compared to Resque. <code>mid-circle</code> key is essentially a <a href="https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush#pattern-circular-list" target="_blank">Circular list</a> that makes the queue reliable. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/blob/master/src/taoensso/carmine/message_queue.clj" target="_blank">implementation</a> if you need more clues around how it works.</p>

<p>Let’s look at Redis operations that happen when jobs are enqueued and processed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enqueue to the low queue
HSET carmine:mq:low:messages &lt;job id&gt; &lt;job payload&gt;
LPUSH carmine:mq:low:mid-circle &lt;job_id&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the job payload and the list of job ids in the queue are stored separately.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># dequeue
RPOPLPUSH carmine:mq:low:messages carmine:mq:low:messages # move the job from the head to tail within the same list, return &lt;job id&gt;
HGET carmine:mq:low:messages &lt;job id&gt; # fetch the job payload
HSET carmine:mq:low:locks &lt;job id&gt; {expiry} # acquire a lock
... execute the job handler
SADD carmine:mq:low:done &lt;job id&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>&lt;job id&gt;</code> stays in the list, but it’s marked as “done” so it wouldn’t be processed more than once. It will be cleaned up later when another worker takes a “done” job.</p>

<p>I’ve been amazed how completely different this Redis keys setup is! It allows carmine’s message queue to be <strong>resilient</strong> by default: if a worker dequeued a job but died later and didn’t mark it as “done”, it will be processed by another worker after the lock expires.</p>

<p>Of course you can still do the hack the same feature into Resque, but with its keys structure the implementation would be orders of magnitude more complex (we actually did that at Shopify).</p>

<p>Another aspect is atomicity. You can see that enqueue and dequeue operations involve multiple commands, and if connectivity to Redis is lost or Redis goes does, it’s possible to get the store into inconsistent state. Resque works around that by enforcing TTL on as many keys as possible and pruning dead workers from the set.</p>

<p>Carmine, in contrast, leverages <a href="https://redis.io/commands/eval" target="_blank">Lua support</a> in Redis and makes <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/blob/master/src/lua/mq/enqueue.lua" target="_blank">enqueue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/blob/master/src/lua/mq/dequeue.lua" target="_blank">dequeue</a> atomic by making them Lua scripts.</p>

<p>The most of Carmine’s message queue implementation was developed in 2012-2013, which is not too long from the initial Resque release, but you can see how much different and more advanced it is.</p>

<p>I’m wondering how we can use this as a lesson to:</p>

<p>1) see the variety of decisions that you can take when designing something on top of Redis</p>

<p>2) question whether we don’t have to forever stick with Resque’s keys design and try something different.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2 id="announcing-krator">Announcing Krator</h2>

<p>Last September the Krustlet project refactored our API to employ a state
machine pattern for describing the lifecycle of Pods. The design of this API
was covered in depth in my
<a href="https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/">previous blog post</a>.
Since then we have made a number of refinements to this interface and extended
our use of the pattern to individual containers within each Pod. These changes
also served to simplify and make more generic our API, and were done in part as
a stepping stone to the crate we are announcing today.</p>

<p>Since introducing this API, we have experienced positive feedback from the
community, including a number of requests to generalize this state machine
architecture so that it can be used to build Kubernetes Operators. It turned
out to be fairly straightforward to extract the “operator” portion of Krustlet
to a new crate, and today we are pleased to announce Krator (pronounced
crater), which stands for [K]ubernetes [R]ust st[at]e machine Operat[or].
Krator was released alongside the latest release of Krustlet, <code>0.6.0</code>, and
Krustlet now uses Krator internally to watch Pods and manage their state
machines.</p>

<p>Implementing an Operator involves a number of moving parts, so I have put
together a fairly minimal example, which I will walk through in the rest of
this post. If you just want to browse the code, it currently lives in the
Krustlet GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/tree/master/crates/krator">here</a>, and
documentation can be found on <a href="https://docs.rs/krator">docs.rs</a> (once Krustlet
<code>0.6.0</code> is released).</p>

<h2 id="writing-an-operator">Writing an Operator</h2>

<p>As an example, we will create an operator to manage <code>Moose</code> custom resources.
Using Krator, we will write a state machine that will describe the possible
states of a <code>Moose</code>, and how it should transition between these states. First,
we must write a custom resource definition, which is very easy using the
<code>CustomResource</code> derive macro from the <code>kube</code> crate!</p>

<pre><code>use kube_derive::CustomResource;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(CustomResource, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Default)]
#[kube(
    group = "animals.com",
    version = "v1",
    kind = "Moose",
    derive = "Default",
    status = "MooseStatus",
    namespaced
)]
struct MooseSpec {
    /// Shoulder height in meters.
    height: f64,
    /// Body weight in kilograms.
    weight: f64,
    antlers: bool,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each <code>Moose</code> has a spec which includes height, weight, and whether it has
antlers. <code>CustomResource</code> lets us also specify that a resource should support
the Kubernetes <code>status</code> API, which is required for a Krator Operator. We
specified that our status type was <code>MooseStatus</code> which we will define as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
enum MoosePhase {
    Asleep,
    Hungry,
    Roaming,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct MooseStatus {
    phase: Option&lt;MoosePhase&gt;,
    /// ~ Moose noises ~
    message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>As our state machine transitions to new states, Krator will automatically
update the object’s status with the Kubernetes API. To do this, Krator requires
that this status type implement a trait, <code>ObjectStatus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>impl ObjectStatus for MooseStatus {
    /// Use to generate an error status if an unhandled error occurs.
    fn failed(e: &amp;str) -&gt; MooseStatus {
        MooseStatus {
            message: Some(format!("Error tracking moose: {}.", e)),
            phase: None,
        }
    }

    /// Converts the arbitrary status type to a JSON patch to send to
    /// Kubernetes.
    fn json_patch(&amp;self) -&gt; serde_json::Value {
        // Generate a map containing only set fields.
        let mut status = serde_json::Map::new();

        if let Some(phase) = self.phase.clone() {
            status.insert("phase".to_string(), serde_json::json!(phase));
        };

        if let Some(message) = self.message.clone() {
            status.insert("message".to_string(), serde_json::Value::String(message));
        };

        // Create status patch with map.
        serde_json::json!({ "status": serde_json::Value::Object(status) })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to define data types for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data that is shared across state handlers for a single object (moose in this
case)</li>
<li>Data that is shared across state machines (shared between objects)</li>
</ul>

<p>We must also implement a trait, <code>ObjectState</code> which lets Krator know how all
of these types relate to the state machine.</p>

<pre><code>struct MooseState {
    /// All moose names start with 'M'
    name: String,
    /// Food mass in kilograms.
    food: f64,
}

struct SharedMooseState {
    /// Map moose name to set of moose friend's names (moose friendships are directed).
    friends: HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ObjectState for MooseState {
    type Manifest = Moose;
    type Status = MooseStatus;
    type SharedState = SharedMooseState;

    /// Clean up data related to a specific object.
    async fn async_drop(self, shared: &amp;mut Self::SharedState) {
        shared.friends.remove(&amp;self.name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are now ready to implement our state machine. Below is a diagram of the
states we will represent. When a <code>Moose</code> object is first created, Krator will
initialize the state machine in the <code>Tagged</code> state. This will populate our
shared state and then transition to the <code>Roam</code> state. The moose will roam the
wilderness and with some probability encounter other moose and become friends.
Eventually, the moose will get hungry and transition to the <code>Eat</code> state, which
will replenish its <code>food</code> level but also make it tired. It will then transition
to the <code>Sleep</code> state for 60 seconds before returning to the <code>Roam</code> state. Note
that the final state, <code>Released</code>, is only reached when the <code>Moose</code> object is
marked for deletion in the Kubernetes API and Krator interrupts the state
machine and transitions to <code>Released</code>. In some operators, end states are also
reachable under certain conditions from within the state machine graph, such as
a Pod transitioning to <code>Completed</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://deislabs.io/images/moose-state-machine.svg" alt="Moose State Machine"></p>

<p>State implementations are currently a little verbose, so I will include a
single state implementation here. The rest can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/master/crates/krator/examples/moose.rs">the complete example</a>.
The important information is within the <code>next</code> and <code>status</code> methods of each
trait implementation. The <code>status</code> method is called when each state is
<em>entered</em>, so it should describe the state it is associated with. We have
considered using macros for implementing <code>State</code>, but have not been satisfied
with Rust’s error messages for errors originating from within these macros. If
you have any experience with macros and think you can come up with something
nice, please let us know!</p>

<p>The <code>next</code> method is the main code block for each state, sometimes referred to
as the state handler. This method has a number of important arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes ownership of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> to access shared state. For more information on this API,
see the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html">Tokio documentation</a>.</li>
<li>A mutable reference to the object state.</li>
<li>A <code>Manifest&lt;_&gt;</code> which acts as a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes">reflector</a>.
This type implements the <code>Stream</code> API for detecting changes to the object
manifest within a state handler, or you can simply call <code>latest</code> to obtain
a clone of the current object manifest.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
/// Moose is roaming the wilderness.
struct Roam;

async fn make_friend(
    name: &amp;str,
    shared: &amp;Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;
) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt; {
    let mut mooses = shared.write().await;
    for (other_moose, friends) in mooses.friends.iter_mut() {
        if name == other_moose {
            continue;
        }
        if !friends.contains(name) {
            friends.insert(name.to_string());
            return Some(other_moose.to_string());
        }
    }
    return None;
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl State&lt;MooseState&gt; for Roam {
    async fn next(
        self: Box&lt;Self&gt;,
        shared: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;,
        state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: Manifest&lt;Moose&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Transition&lt;MooseState&gt; {
        loop {
            tokio::time::delay_for(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            state.food -= 5.0;
            if state.food &lt;= 50.0 {
                return Transition::next(self, Eat);
            }
            let r: f64 = {
                let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                rng.gen()
            };
            if r &lt; 0.05 {
                if let Some(other_moose) = make_friend(&amp;state.name, &amp;shared).await {
                    info!("{} made friends with {}!", state.name, other_moose);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    async fn status(
        &amp;self,
        _state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: &amp;Moose,
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;MooseStatus&gt; {
        Ok(MooseStatus {
            phase: Some(MoosePhase::Roaming),
            message: Some("Gahrooo!".to_string()),
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To finish our state machine, we must define valid transitions between states.
The compiler will ensure that we do not make invalid transitions, which helps
us to avoid undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>impl TransitionTo&lt;Roam&gt; for Tagged {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Eat&gt; for Roam {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Sleep&gt; for Eat {}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, Krator provides a macro for deriving this trait:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default, TransitionTo)]
#[transition_to(Roam)]
/// Moose is sleeping.
struct Sleep;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we must implement the <code>Operator</code> trait to tie this all together. Note
that the state machine API itself does not require that the <code>Manifest</code> is a
valid Kubernetes API resource. This allows the state machine pattern to be used
with a broader set of types (we used it for containers, which are not a
Kubernetes resource type). This, however, will require you to reimplement the
function which drives the state machine, as we did for
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/3b120ec6a00123afd1407d049b61282c67e71676/crates/kubelet/src/container/state.rs#L18">containers</a>.</p>

<p>To get the full benefit of Krator, which watches for changes to your API
resource, spawns state machines, and handles status updates, you will need to
satisfy additional trait bounds which are placed on associated types of the
<code>Operator</code> trait. Namely, <code>Manifest</code> must be
<a href="https://docs.rs/k8s-openapi/0.10.0/k8s_openapi/trait.Metadata.html"><code>Metadata&lt;Ty = ObjectMeta&gt;</code></a>,
<code>DeserializeOwned</code>, and <code>Default</code>. <code>Status</code> must be <code>ObjectStatus</code> (as
described above).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most people consider logging something nice to have; a supplement to the code that matters or something you add in order to debug a problem.</p><p>Having worked for the past year in a distributed microservices architecture I finally discovered what logging truly is: it's Google Analytics for your code.</p><p>Think about this: the business asks you to track interesting behaviour so it has the information it needs to make informed decisions. They want to know if a feature is driving in more customers, if a campaign is getting traction, if one solution is preferrable over another.</p><p>Shouldn't you, as a professional, have the same understanding about the code you ship?</p><p>Day to day we need to be able to answer these sort of questions:</p><ul><li>Did we receive the transaction receipt for PRODUCT-XYZ last night?</li><li>How much has the stock level increased for PRODUCT-ABC since last week?</li><li>At what time did we receive the unique number for SHIPMENT-123 from our provider? Can you check what that is?</li></ul><p><i>Disclaimer: we're mostly writing middleware that connects external services, so we don't store much data on our own. We're on one end of the logging spectrum: if we don't log an incoming request that request has not happened. On the other hand if we were storing data on something like Datomic (which records plenty of metatada around transactions) we would have different logging requirements. The point remains the same, just think about something that you don't store directly.</i></p><p>Then again, from a more technical but still business relevant point of view, we'd like to answer:</p><ul><li>Did adding FEATURE-XYZ slow down our response time? By how much?</li><li>Are some parts of the system memory bound or cpu bound? How much buffer do we have before we hit the limits? Can we project what load would force us to increase those limits?</li><li>Where there any noticeable effects during the ABC-OUTAGE? What parts were effected? Can we trigger some alerts when we detect similar behaviour before an outage occurs?</li></ul><p>The list could be longer, these are just a few ideas. The point is, if you have anything similar to a <a href="https://manifesto.co.uk/definition-done">Definition of done</a> in your team, then you should definitely add "Implemented relevant logging metrics" to the checklist. Just like implementing automated tests for your code is important, adding appropriate logging delivers business value along with the code you ship.</p><p>Below is a list of things I learned while refining the logging behaviour of our system. The two most important realisations for me were:</p><ul><li>Make log event explicits (by giving them a name)</li><li>Make the act of logging explicit (by passing a log around).</li></ul><p>Both choices had a positive series of ramification that I will discuss in each section.</p><h2>Tracking analytics means naming things</h2><p>The major improvement in our logging infrastructure happened when we decided to use <a href="http://riemann.io/">Riemann</a>. On top of the many benefits Riemann has, it is very opinionated on the shape of the data it accepts. For example, it requires each entry to have a unique name (called a "service" in Riemann). That was a revolution for us. Much like Google Analytics, anything you want to track needs to have a name, so you can refer to it, observe it, query it, plot it, pinpoint it.</p><h3>Leverage namespaced keywords</h3><p>Clojure makes it extremely easy to give the things you log unique, memorable names thanks to namespaced keywords. Yes, Rich Hickey is right <a href="http://clojure.org/about/spec#_global_namespaced_names_are_more_important">once again</a>. For example:</p><pre><code>(log/warn logger ::customer.update {:reason "Not found"})
</code></pre><p>Assuming you're logging this in <code>(ns app.user)</code> the resulting name for this log entry would be <code>:app.user/customer.update</code> which makes it easy both to filter for things in the same namespace and to search for a memorable name.</p><p>Don't rely on file line numbers for the things you want to log, name them. Line numbers change and have no context where as names are easy to search for, to remember, to graph and to reason about.</p><h3>Use the same name with different states</h3><p>This is again something derived from Riemann. At the beginning we logged things like this:</p><pre><code>(if (healthy? system)
  (log/info logger ::system.health.good)
  (log/error logger ::system.health.bad {:reason (describe system)}))
</code></pre><p>But after a while we changed this pattern to be</p><pre><code>(if (healthy? system)
  (log/info logger ::system.health)
  (log/error logger ::system.health {:reason (describe system)}))
</code></pre><p>Both events name are the same, so we can easily trigger an alert when something transitions from a good state to a bad state (or vice-versa). We can also have more general rules while the first pattern forces you to have lots of custom rules. Name the same things the same way, only change the logging level if you need to.</p><h3>Log data, not strings</h3><p>There's a bunch of useful things you are likely to log once you discard the limitation of a legacy logging framework that forces your log data to be a String.</p><p>A complete log event should look something like:</p><pre><code>{:service     :user.profile/update
 :level       :warn
 :time        #inst "2016-01-01"
 :description {:before-trasact 'a
               :after-transact 'b}
 :metric      100
 :tags        ['X-Request-Id 'goggles-enabled 'prerelease]
 :host        "localhost"}
</code></pre><p>For example another good idea we got from Riemann is to attach a <code>:metric</code> key to as many events as possible.</p><pre><code>(log/info ::api.request {:metric (time req)}
(log/info ::parse.unsubscribers {:metric (count unsubscribers)}
(log/warn ::job.timeout {:metric (count retries)}
(log/warn ::heap.threshold {:metric (percentage-heap-used)}
</code></pre><p>But that's just one of the many examples. We've added extra fields like <code>:request-id</code> to track a single operation across many services, <code>:execution-id</code> to follow a code execution asynchronously, <code>:features</code> enabled on that deployment, <code>:customer-id</code> to group by actions made by a single user etc. etc.</p><p>Once you realise it's all data the possibilites are endless.</p><h3>Don't answer a question: show the answer</h3><p>This is not strictly about logging but it's related. We ship all our logs to both Riemann (for realtime monitoring) and to Elasticsearch (for storage and querying).</p><p><img src="https://juxt-public.s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/kibana.png"></p><p>Many of the questions asked at the beginning of the post require just a few searches on Elasticsearch to come up with a quick answer. But the obvious next step is to provide the business with graphs and plots that can answer their question without having to run a search manually. Kibana is very good at this and having events with a name (and a metric) makes it easy to show them graphically. You also start to choose the events you want to track, putting yourself in the shoes of your future self or the business and thinking about what you want to see displayed on a dashboard.</p><h3>Keep visualisation code and logging code in sync</h3><p>A bonus feature we discovered: Kibana (and I'm sure many other tools) describes the visualisations as json and allows you to import them.</p><p>If you describe those visualisation in a code project and add it as a dependency, then you can cross link the <code>:namespaced/keywords</code> you use in your logging code with the ones you reference in your visualisations. So when you decide to rename/refactor one of the events, you don't break existing dashboards.</p><h2>Logging performs a side effect and that's nothing to be ashamed of</h2><p>We try to be disciplined about the way we structure effectful code. We discovered through trial and error than having global state causes more problems than it solves and sneaking side effects into a function might make your life easier now but it's inevitably going to harm you in the long run.</p><p>Instead of relying on a global logger instance, pass a Logger explicitly to the functions that need to perform logging.</p><h3>Learn from the Java lesson</h3><p>The situation that the Java ecosystem logging is in should make you think about what went wrong. Between the <a href="https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/java-logging-basics">inhumane number of standards</a> and the awkward <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html">xml or .properties files</a> initialisation, using any of these tools requires hours (even days) of study and understanding all because of a fundamentally wrong choice at the bottom.</p><p>Java Logging wanted to be a transparent tool, a static class initialised somehow that works out of the box. It's magic. And like all magic software sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't. A hit-and-miss magic wand is not what you need to build something reliable.</p><p>If you throw away all the assumptions about static initialisation and global singleton, all you're left with is a dead simple interface:</p><pre><code>(defprotocol Logger
 (log [this msg]))
</code></pre><p>Do you want a logger that prints to stdout?</p><pre><code>(defrecord StdoutLogger [] Logger
 (log [this msg] (println msg)))
</code></pre><p>Do you want a logger that sends log in json format to ElasticSearch?</p><pre><code>(defrecord ElasticSearchLogger [] Logger
 (log [this msg] (http/post "elastic.domain" (json/encode msg))))
</code></pre><p>Do you want it to be fully asyncronous using core.async?</p><pre><code>(defrecord AsyncLogger [channel] Logger
 (log [this msg] (async/&gt;! channel msg)))
</code></pre><p>Done. No magic at all.</p><p>Another problem you find in traditional logging frameworks happens when you want to carry some context between logging calls. The classic example is to attach a <code>user-id</code> value to all the methods invoked during a request performed by a certain user. This is extremely useful so that you don't have to pass around all the information that you want to log to all the subroutines that your main function invokes. It usually works like this:</p><pre><code>(log-framework/set-context! {:user-id "abc"})
;; much later, in a nested function
(log-framework/perform-log {:foo :bar}) ;; this contains {:user-id "abc"}
</code></pre><p>If you pass around a logger explicitly this problem disappears. When you want to pass contextual information you simply create a new <code>Logger</code> that sets that information whenever you call it. It works just like <code>map</code> works:</p><pre><code>(defn map* [f logger]
  (reify Logger
    (log [this msg] (log logger (f msg)))))

(defn handle-user-request [logger user-id]
 (let [logger* (map* #(assoc % :user-id user-id) logger)]
  ...)) ;; whenever logger* is used the user-id is automatically added

</code></pre><p>What about eliding certain types of logs in production vs deployments? Do you want to do that passing some flags in your xml configurations or you prefer to do it yourself? I prefer to write:</p><pre><code>(let…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since its founding, America has been a country of diverse people from diverse backgrounds with diverse values and beliefs. Yet somehow, miraculously, this diverse group of people were able to come together around a set of unifying beliefs that provided the foundation for a constitutional democracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This combination of diversity and unity has always been both a strength and an ideal of America. <em>E pluribus unum </em>(“out of many, one”), or <em>pluralism</em> is at the very foundation of our nation. Being an ideal, pluralism is something we are, or at least should be, striving for, even though we often fall short. It is a project that will not be complete until our nation is inclusive of all and simultaneously unified as a nation.</p>



<p>America is, and always has been, much too diverse for any one group of people, any one set of values and beliefs, or any one way of living to dictate how all the others should be, think, feel, and live. Attempts in this direction have been and will continue to be doomed to fail. Americans are an unruly and independent lot who distrust authority and take to heart the motto “Don’t tread on me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trick is finding a framework of values and beliefs that are enough to unite us as a nation and allow us to live peaceably together, while leaving plenty of room for diverging values and beliefs within that framework. Complete unity is therefore neither possible nor desirable. Striking this balance of unity and diversity is the art of pluralism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, pluralism is under attack, both from the political left and the political right in America. The political polarization we are experiencing in our country is the direct result of the marginalization of certain groups, values, belief, and ways of life. Unless pluralism is reasserted as fundamental to the functioning of our democracy, the polarization will only grow and our democracy will eventually fracture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The political left in America are often referred to as “liberals.” While it is easy to question the accuracy of that label, it is accurate inasmuch as many on the left still strive for the ideals of (classical) liberalism, at least as they interpret them. The ideals of classical liberalism, e.g., the inherent value of and freedom for the individual, are universal in nature. It therefore would seem to follow that these ideals should be promoted universally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in their efforts to promote liberalism domestically, the American political left has mistakenly assumed two things. The first is that their own interpretation of liberal values is the single and correct one. The second is that their interpretation of liberal values is worth promoting at the cost of others’ freedoms. Together, these assumptions combine to form a sort of domestic Neoliberalism, or liberal universalism in America. In other words, <em>monism</em>, the opposite of pluralism.</p>



<p>Whether it is a federally created healthcare system, national education standards, the diminishing of states’ rights, executive orders, or Federal and Supreme Court judicial activism, pluralism is the victim when policy is made top-down and reflects only some Americans’ values, no matter how desirable the policy ends might be. This is especially true when major policy is made without significant support from the multiple sides of the political spectrum.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, many people on the political right have reacted negatively to what they view as infringements on their values and beliefs by Washington. Condescension toward “deplorables” on the right by political and cultural elites on the left certainly do not help matters in this regard.</p>



<p>This situation has created ground fertile for populism. But more than that, it has given rise to the political right’s own threat to American pluralism: American Nationalism. And, just as with domestic Neoliberalism, American Nationalism makes its own false assumptions. It assumes that there is an essential, unified culture that is the truly “American” culture, usually defined as the culture of those of Euro-Christian descent. American Nationalism also assumes that this culture needs to fight to retake its dominant position in the American political and cultural landscape.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, many on the left, as well as many who do not identify with this “American” culture, take issue with this. And the apocalyptic language and racist overtones of American Nationalism certainly do not engender goodwill from those outside this “culture”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most insidiously, however, are those on the far-left and the far-right who have come to view the entire American system as corrupt and ripe for overthrow. Whether it be the ideologically driven and ahistorical narrative promoted by the 1619 Project, or the utterly factless conspiracies of QAnon, these extremist movements attack the very values and beliefs that bind our diverse nation together. The only recourse for such groups, and their ultimate goal, is complete revolution and total defeat of their enemies. If either succeeds, America will cease to exist.</p>



<p>But how can we, as a nation, both promote classical liberal ideals and preserve the rich diversity of America? Conservatism holds the answer. In fact, conservatism is the philosophy <em>best</em> suited to cultivating pluralism in America. Bar none.</p>



<p>Conservatism recognizes the importance of nationally unifying values, beliefs, and practices, i.e., national <em>institutions</em>, in a democracy. Without a large majority sharing and upholding some essential, basic beliefs about government, society, and the individual, democracy would devolve into tribal government. Conservatism therefore views the creation and maintenance of national institutions as critical to pluralism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>National institutions in America include things such as the Constitution, elections, democratic governance, and the rule of law, as well as the civil obligation every individual has to actively support these. National institutions require the submission of individual will to the common good, even, and perhaps especially, when those institutions go counter to our own interests and desires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>National institutions cannot be created or upheld by political leaders alone. Business and civic leaders, teachers, doctors, journalists, researchers, preachers, imams, rabbis, and families need to speak for, inculcate, cultivate, and exemplify a deep respect for and support of our national institutions. Doing so is what we call <em>patriotism</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to nationalism, which seeks to promote one culture as dominant and superior to others, patriotism is inclusive of people of all cultures who are willing to join together in supporting national institutions.</p>



<p>However, despite the importance of national institutions, pluralism can only flourish if those national institutions are narrow and limited in scope. This is because the values and beliefs that the diverse citizens of any nation hold in common are limited.</p>



<p>If national institutions are too broad and expansive, they will crowd out the rich diversity of other societal institutions that make up the bedrock of pluralism and a healthy society. Furthermore, broad and expansive national institutions inevitably espouse broad and expansive values and beliefs, which reflect those of an ever-narrower slice of the national citizenry. Thus, national institutions that grow too large inevitably induce populism and disenchantment with the system as a whole through suppressing the variety of ways of living represented by pluralism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, pluralism is also suppressed when one culture claims dominance and superiority over others. While recognizing the importance of a certain, shared, national culture, i.e., the (narrow) set of values and beliefs embodied in national institutions, efforts to nationalize culture generally are just as harmful to pluralism as expansive government. Whether by government fiat or cultural force, suppressing people’s values and beliefs–as long as those values and beliefs do not actively undermine national institutions–is not acceptable and contrary to both liberal and conservative ideals.</p>



<p>So what can be done to promote pluralism in America?</p>



<p>The left in America can realize that diversity is much more than skin color, gender, and who you are attracted to. In fact, these categories only scratch the surface of identity and diversity. Identity and diversity are expansive and complex, encompassing people’s values, beliefs, and ways of living out their lives.</p>



<p>The left can also stop top-down attempts to impose (supposedly liberal) values and beliefs beyond those basic tenets found in our national, democratic institutions. Liberal values can be interpreted in a plurality of ways. As long as those ways are consistent with the (limited) national institutions we have established, they must be respected. Non-government institutions need to be promoted, not suppressed or competed out of existence by government action. There needs to be a separation of culture and state. Monism kills democracy. Pluralism allows it to flourish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the right in America can stand up for American democratic values instead of claiming that there is only one, essential, “American” culture (which happens to be theirs) that must dominate. The right can demonstrate true patriotism by ceasing to reject national institutions and by helping to <em>conserve</em> the richness of American cultural diversity, a cultural diversity that has been part of this country since its founding.</p>



<p>For those who worry that American traditions are eroding in the face of increasing diversity, it is important to point out that tradition <em>is</em> worth preserving. But, for real conservatives, traditions <em>as such</em> are what is important, not any one, single tradition that should be promoted over others. Real conservatism is about finding the balance between national unity and cultural diversity, i.e., pluralism. And real conservatives would do well to remember it.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9609">

	

	<div>
		
<p>Today, 2021-02-05 at 12:00 UTC, <a href="https://destevez.net/tag/tianwen/">Tianwen-1</a> has executed TCM-4. This is its last trajectory correction manoeuvre before the arrival to Mars orbit next Tuesday February 10. This was <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nAwQ6wUMmIcRGi7cAZwflQ">reported by Chinese media</a> together with a black and white image of Mars taken recently by the spacecraft.</p>



<p>As usual, I have analysed this manoeuvre by propagating forwards the last state vector that we have from the spacecraft’s telemetry before the manoeuvre, propagating backwards the first state vector that we have after the manoeuvre, and finding the intersection point of the two trajectories.</p>



<p>This time the result is not very precise because of two reasons. First, the last state vector we have from before the manoeuvre is from 2021-02-02 23:33 UTC due to a problem with the telemetry reception in <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/">AMSAT-DL</a>‘s <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/en/20-meter-antenna/">Bochum observatory</a>. Therefore, we need to propagate this state vector 2.5 days forward, whereas in other manoeuvres we had more recent state vectors. Second, this manoeuvre is a small correction, so the angle between the trajectories is small and finding their intersection is an ill conditioned problem.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the distance between the pre-burn and post-burn trajectories. The minimum happens at 10:47:51 UTC, which is quite far from the timestamp of 12:00 UTC reported by the media. The minimum distance is 2.4 km. There is no reason to believe that the media is not correct, since in other occasions the minimum was much smaller than 1 km, which already speaks about the bad accuracy of this method.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tcm4_distance.png"><img width="644" height="348" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tcm4_distance-644x348.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tcm4_distance-644x348.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tcm4_distance-300x162.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tcm4_distance.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The delta-V vector in ICRF coordinates and m/s is the following. This should be quite accurate, even thought the time of the burn could not be found precisely.</p>



<pre>[ 0.49150875,  0.29430668, -0.28538354]</pre>



<p>The magnitude of this vector is 0.64 m/s.</p>



<p>The arrival trajectory can be seen in the figure below, which shows an orbit simulation in <a href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/">GMAT</a>. The periapsis height is 408 km, and the inclination is 10.9 degrees. Note that the periapsis passage is almost exactly at 12:00 UTC. This is perhaps a coincidence, or maybe the result of deliberate and careful orbit planning.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021.png"><img width="1350" height="661" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021.png 1350w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021-300x147.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021-644x315.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GmatScreenShot_021-768x376.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px"></a><figcaption>Tianwen-1 Mars arrival trajectory</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy">specific energy</a> of the orbit is 3.10 km²/s², and the periapsis velocity is 5.36 km/s. For a capture orbit with a period of 11 days, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318234916_Overview_of_China%27s_2020_Mars_Mission_Design_and_Navigation">this article</a>, the required delta-V is 660 m/s. Assuming a specific impulse of 321.6 s (see <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/10/tianwen-1-deep-space-manoeuvre/#comment-258240">this comment</a>) and a thrust of 3 kN (this value has appeared published several times in the media), this delta-V will spend 836 kg of fuel over 879 seconds. Note that the delta-V that would be required for a parabolic orbit insertion (i.e., to obtain a specific energy of zero) is 614 m/s, so the capture into an 11 day orbit is only slightly more expensive. The spacecraft will move later into a parking orbit with a period of around 2 days.</p>



<p>The figure below shows an example capture orbit with a period of 10.69 days. It was obtained by burning retrograde for 889 seconds around periapis. The resulting orbit has a periapsis altitude of 293 km.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my spare time I’m a volunteer with my state’s emergency services and we
have our own web app for managing unit-specific things like attendance, vehicle
checks, newsletters, on-call rosters, and so on.</p><p>It’s actually a really useful tool, but there is one feature that really
annoys me… The list of member contact details is only available as a PDF
and not a format that can be imported into your phone’s contacts.</p><p>This means if you need to contact someone you first need to:</p><ol><li>download the contact list to your phone</li><li>zoom in so you can read the table’s rows</li><li>find the person’s name</li><li>pan over to their phone number</li><li>Copy the number and paste it into your messaging app</li></ol><p>I need to do this infrequently enough that it’s not worth manually creating a
new contact, yet just often enough to be annoying. It’d be <em>really</em> nice if I
just needed to download the contact list once and have all the information
available on my phone… There must be a better way!</p><p>I’ve contacted one of the developers to see if we can get a better solution
but in the meantime figured that, as a programmer, I should be able to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U">bodge</a> something together.</p><div><p>Unfortunately the code written in this article isn’t publicly available
because it contains personally identifiable information.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s <a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com/issues">issue
tracker</a>!</p></div><h2 id="whats-in-a-pdf">What’s in a PDF?</h2><p>So our first job is to take a PDF document like this…</p><p><img src="https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/img/contact-list.png" alt="Screenshot of a PDF containing a table with redacted cells"></p><p>… and extract the data in the table.</p><p>That’s easy enough, there is already a Rust crate (unsurprisingly called
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/pdf"><code>pdf</code></a>) for parsing PDF documents so we can reuse that.</p><p>For these sorts of jobs I won’t do much planning up-front, instead I’ll click
around <a href="https://docs.rs/pdf/">the crate’s API docs</a> and figure out how to use the
provided functionality to do what I want.</p><p>After a bit of clicking through I figured out that <a href="https://docs.rs/pdf/0.7.1/pdf/file/struct.File.html"><code>pdf::file::File</code></a>
represented the overall document and was just a fancy list of
<a href="https://docs.rs/pdf/0.7.1/pdf/object/struct.Page.html"><code>pdf::object::Page</code>s</a>, where a <code>Page</code>’s <a href="https://docs.rs/pdf/0.7.1/pdf/content/struct.Content.html">content</a> is just a
list of <a href="https://docs.rs/pdf/0.7.1/pdf/content/struct.Operation.html"><code>Operation</code>s</a>… And that’s where my understanding of PDF
documents was completely turned on its head.</p><p>You see, I used to believe that a PDF was a declarative format containing a
bunch of high-level objects like <code>Table</code> and <code>Heading</code> and so on (almost like
HTML)… However, after skimming through <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/PDFReference.pdf">the PDF format spec</a>
from Adobe (which is itself a PDF - how meta!) it was evident that PDF is
more like an interpreted programming language where you’ll go through each
<code>Operation</code> in a page executing draw calls and updating the renderer’s state
as you go.</p><p>That makes things interesting. It means I can’t just look for a
(hypothetical) <code>Table</code> object in the DOM and iterate over its <code>cells</code> field.
Instead I’ll need to iterate over every instruction and keep track of the
current state.</p><p>These instructions are pretty low-level, too. Here are (as best I can tell) the
instructions for drawing the <em>“Surname”</em> and <em>“First Name”</em> cells.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="postscript"><span>BT</span> <span>:</span>

something funky with their coordinates.</p><p>First, I’ll create something to represent text objects and stub out a type

thanks to pattern matching. I know ahead of time <em>exactly</em> which operations
I’m looking for and what their operands will be so each pattern can be its
own branch in a big <code>match</code> statement. Then the language will automatically
make sure I’ve got the correct number of operands with the correct types, and
bind the information I want to extract to local variables.</p><p>The idea is that every time someone calls <code>TextObjectParser</code>’s <code>next()</code>
method we’ll keep consuming <code>Operation</code>s, matching on their operator and
operands while updating some temporary state, then when we see an <code>"ET"</code>
operation we yield what we’ve seen to the caller.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/lib.rs

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk and Tesla are famous for being the only company developing autonomous cars that will not use LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) as one of its sensors. In typical Elon Musk fashion, Tesla stands alone while others insist that LiDAR is absolutely necessary for autonomous driving. Instead of LiDAR, Tesla uses a combination of <strong>cameras</strong> to cover 360° around the car, <strong>radar</strong> (Radio Detection and Ranging) to complement the objection detection of cameras in adverse weather conditions, and <strong>ultrasonic sensors</strong> for detecting objects very close to the car (up to 8m or 26 feet away).</p><figure id="w-node-55db712824b9-026952b6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe1568b0a42818305550d1/600efde4ea22de6b31282ee4_tesla%20sensors%20-%20full%20range.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Tesla's three sensor systems:&nbsp;cameras, radar, and ultrasonics</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Musk has become infamous for his bold statements against LiDAR, none more strong than his statement at Tesla's Autonomy Day in 2019:</p><p><em>"LiDAR is a fool’s errand. Anyone relying on LiDAR is doomed. Doomed! [They are] expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices. Like, one appendix is bad, well now you have a whole bunch of them, it’s ridiculous, you’ll see.”</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&amp;t">Tesla Autonomy Day YouTube video</a>, 1:41:23-1:41:50)</p><p>Autopilot Review has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q">compiled clips of all statements against LiDAR from Tesla’s Autonomy Day</a> by Musk and the Director of AI at Tesla, Andrej Karpathy.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Technically, Tesla is not the only company developing autonomous cars that rejects the use of LiDAR. George Hotz of <a href="http://comma.ai/">Comma.AI</a> also believes that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-george-hotz-right-solving-autonomy-through-vision-moritz-keck">LiDAR is unnecessary</a> and unable to solve the problem of perception/vision. <a href="https://www.torquenews.com/11826/elon-musk-thanks-fsd-beta-testers-and-emphasizes-importance-labeling-video">Torquenews summarizes Hotz’ criticism of LiDAR</a>: “According to [Hotz], these companies are doomed to fail since they use LiDAR to localize their driving to centimeters. This means rather than their AIs looking at a scene and deciding where to go, the companies <strong>pre-map their routes</strong> and use Lidar to <strong>localize their location within centimeters so that the vehicles can follow it</strong>” (emphases added).</p><h2><strong>Basic Arguments Against LiDAR:</strong></h2><h4><strong>Expensive, Useless in Bad Weather, Power Hungry, and Ugly</strong></h4><p><strong>1. LiDAR is expensive -- both initial costs and maintenance costs.</strong> Even though Google’s Waymo has been able to <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2017/01/09/waymo-google-shaved-90-off-lidar-sensor-cost-producing-house-75000-7500/">reduce the cost of LiDAR by 90% from $75,000 (in 2009) to $7,500 (in 2017)</a>, the need for <em>three</em> LiDAR systems means that LiDAR will be unable to provide a low-cost robotaxi fleet or gain widespread market penetration any time soon. In fact, <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">Waymo’s fifth generation car</a> introduced in March 2020, increased the number of LiDAR sensors <em>from three to</em> <em>four</em>, further increasing costs. Waymo even refuses to be transparent about the cost of its cars, so we do not even know what it costs. <a href="https://qz.com/924212/what-it-really-costs-to-turn-a-car-into-a-self-driving-vehicle/">One estimate from 2017</a> claims that one autonomous car equipped with LiDAR might cost $250,000, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/01/22/waymo-ceo-says-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-gives-estimated-cost-of-autonomous-vehicles/?sh=b413b65541b1">a more recent article</a> estimates about $180,000. In contrast, Tesla’s $38,000 Model 3, with a $10,000 full-self driving (FSD) add-on, already has all the computer hardware and sensors necessary for autonomous driving. All we are waiting for is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux">a version of Tesla’s neural network software that is 10x safer than a human driver</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, we must also account for <strong><em>the cost of maintenance</em></strong>. Because LiDAR uses moving parts, it is easier for it to break or malfunction and, thus, it is more expensive to maintain. Radar has no moving parts and is cheap to replace.</p><p>Yes, <a href="https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/">Wright’s Law</a> tells us that all new technologies eventually drop in price, but it may be too late when that occurs and Tesla may have already won the race to autonomous cars before LiDAR drops enough in price to compete with <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/24/the-economics-of-a-tesla-robotaxi-and-a-quicker-easier-path-to-profit/">Tesla’s low-cost robotaxi fleet</a>.</p><p><strong>2. LiDAR is unable to work well in bad weather conditions.</strong> Since LiDAR uses visible lasers in order to measure distance, LiDAR is unable to work well in bad weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, and fog -- whereas radar still works in such conditions. <em>LiDAR is essentially blind in bad weather</em>. For this reason, autonomous cars using LiDAR still have to use radar in order to drive in such bad weather conditions, further adding to their costs.</p><p><strong>3. LiDAR&nbsp;is power hungry, needing more power than other sensors.</strong> Out of all sensors, LiDAR&nbsp;requires the most power, which has the effect of <em>decreasing the car’s driving range</em> and thus <em>needing to recharge the car more often</em>. This disadvantage should not be underestimated since more frequent recharging and higher charging costs would be devastating for running a low-cost robotaxi fleet and would be a major turn-off for consumers, who don't want to be charging their cars all the time for both cost and convenience reasons.</p><p><strong>4. LiDAR is ugly.</strong> While this does not matter from an engineering or safety perspective, it does matter from a consumer’s perspective when choosing a car. There is no way around how ugly LiDAR sensors look when they are placed atop a car.</p><figure id="w-node-ffbcc622196b-026952b6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe1568b0a42818305550d1/600f216266e1d32de3a7303f_1towrlCigjBDWvUQ754KjSAh7TH9o-kYK8khxoRWf5pHB3KAFDnp1mtDpAt3pBY4MP2NmNP9ln-yZtHF2jB5ymPwZdBwlqsTXPA-qxwVKHxSGSADOvJCz2bsdhNcTfg5EOW_Ee4S.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Three LiDAR sensors atop a Waymo car, along with radar and cameras (Image: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-googles-waymo-self-driving-car-work-graphic-2017-1">Business Insider</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-80d74e66d2d0-026952b6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe1568b0a42818305550d1/600f216377e625b14e22770b__k7e-5fflp7OlakCD-0_5xVKcbvVI4r1ZfqEcxYVAx6cGyFPxdMSBKXo8geb86pWf2F1yZep7m-i_Tc6v90vxUKAM4NyWJju71bBy-etXSXALlSDdF6jsy58KECZzWdAUxgW8T1R.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Tesla Model S, with all of its sensors nearly invisible (Image: <a href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1562178235-7ba56b202338?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MjZ8fHRlc2xhfGVufDB8fDB8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=60">Bram Van Oost, Unsplash</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Don't forget: Elon Musk is literally a rocket scientist . . . </strong></h2><p>Before we begin to answer this question, whether LiDAR&nbsp;is even necessary, we must begin with an obvious, but often overlooked point: <strong> Elon Musk and his engineers at Tesla are not ignorant about LiDAR from an engineering/scientific standpoint; Musk is, after all, CEO of SpaceX and uses LiDAR for docking spaceships.</strong> Everyone can acknowledge that Elon Musk is an excellent businessman and entrepreneur, but what many often forget is that Elon Musk is literally a rocket scientist and CEO of SpaceX with a background in physics. Musk’s undergraduate studies at UPenn included a double major in Business and Physics, a strange but powerful combination for tech entrepreneurship. In the midst of Musk’s infamous comments against LiDAR at Tesla’s Autonomy Day, many missed an additional statement he made:&nbsp;<br></p><p><em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I should point out that I don’t actually super hate LiDAR as much as I sound. At SpaceX, the SpaceX dragon uses LiDAR to navigate to the space station and dock. Not only that, SpaceX developed its own LiDAR from scratch to do that and I spearheaded that effort personally. Because in that scenario [a spaceship docking], LiDAR makes sense. But in cars, it’s freakin’ stupid. It’s expensive, unnecessary, and as Andrej [Karpathy] was saying, once you solve vision, [LiDAR] is worthless.”</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&amp;t">Tesla Autonomy Day YouTube video</a>, 2:34:08-2:34:39, lightly edited)</p><p>Musk made a similar point on Twitter:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with <a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Space_Station</a>. </p><p>Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm.</p></div>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329847917834870784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>Unlike other leaders of companies developing autonomous driving, <strong>Musk is first and foremost a scientist/engineer who understands LiDAR and who even personally developed a custom LiDAR system at SpaceX </strong>-- thus, when Musk rejects LiDAR as unnecessary, his arguments need to be seen from more than just a business perspective (LiDAR is expensive, ugly), but also from an engineering/scientific perspective.</p><h2><strong>Reframing the Debate from First Principles&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><p>Elon Musk operates from first principles: “It’s important to reason from first principles, rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is that we reason by analogy. ‘We’re doing this because it’s like something else that was done.’ Or, ‘it’s like what other people are doing.’ . . . It’s mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. But first principles is a physics way of looking at the world. And what that means is you boil down things to the most fundamental truths, ‘What are we sure is true, or sure is possible?’ And then reason up from there.” (lightly edited from an interview with Kevin Rose of Foundation.KR on September 7, 2012, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8</a>, 23:12-23:28)</p><p>So we must begin with some fundamental questions:</p><h3><strong>1st: What exactly are we debating? </strong></h3><h3><strong>The car's "vision"</strong></h3><p>This entire LiDAR vs. cameras debate is fundamentally about <strong>the car's <em>sensors</em></strong> -- how will the car "see" the world around it?</p><p>So this is not fundamentally a “LiDAR vs. cameras” debate, which can be seen all over the Internet through a simple Google search. The comparison should be about <strong>the full package of sensors</strong> each company uses:</p><figure id="w-node-fc8d649abe91-026952b6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe1568b0a42818305550d1/6013b6376306e65b961311d7_chart%201.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In other words, how does Tesla’s full package of sensors (cameras, radar, ultrasonics) compare to other companies and their full package of sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radar, maybe ultrasonics)? <em>That</em> is the debate.</p><h3><strong>2nd: For "vision," how does LiDAR compare to other sensors?</strong></h3><h3><strong>Each sensor has its own strengths and weaknesses</strong><br></h3><p><strong>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</strong></p><p>The fundamental task of LiDAR is for <em>measuring distance</em>. Newer LiDAR technology is continually improving, so that newer LiDARs are gaining camera-like vision in addition to their distance-measuring abilities, but fundamentally, LiDAR was developed for measuring distance. At present, the main disadvantages of LiDAR (mentioned above) are: (1) its high cost, (2) its inability to measure distance through heavy rain, snow, and fog, and (3) its ugliness.<br></p><p><strong>Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging)</strong></p><p>Like LiDAR, radar’s fundamental task is for <em>measuring distance</em>, but it uses radio waves instead of light/lasers. The advantages of radar are: (1) its low cost, (2) its ability to measure distance through heavy rain, snow, and fog, and (3) its ability to be hidden from view.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Solely because of radar’s ability to measure distance through bad weather, even cars with LiDAR still need radar.</strong> However, the richness of the data generated by LiDAR is far superior to radar, as can be seen below (although newer radar systems are getting better and better, but at higher cost).<br></p><figure id="w-node-545d943151ce-026952b6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe1568b0a42818305550d1/6013b65bda1b985e144ecd23_cGkG4JEme3Ay-9DTo97by6Sir8Vth5IsjGZLYlkBdF0EZb6dAwSnGjIuRLpVxHiqSh5cvHndF6XLI3fqfWaM5QdUF6qqVoZ-TsPMdaOhHa9uFhsjoZJ7t-g0ZGEjp1zLzMVirJf-.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image:<a href="https://www.fierceelectronics.com/components/lidar-vs-radar"><strong> </strong>Fierce Electronics</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍<strong>Cameras</strong><br></p><p>Cameras are obviously the most fundamental source of “vision” for the car, but they have limitations: (1) cameras cannot see through obstacles like fog, snow, heavy rain, and (2) cameras cannot measure distance like LiDAR since that is not their purpose, although computers can be …</p></div></div>

            <div data-type="page" data-updated-on="1612552823625" id="page-601d7a506f42587aa4d93797"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-601d7a506f42587aa4d93798"><div><div><p>Today I’m resigning from The New York Times. Those are not words I ever wanted to write.</p><p>Growing up, I never even imagined that I would get the chance to live in New York City or to work in media -- let alone at the paper of record. I’m from a tiny town of a thousand people in the middle of the corn fields of Illinois. I paid my way through Christian College working as a groundskeeper, a dishwasher, a roofer, and at summer jobs in factories and on farms.</p></div><p>And yet, I ended up having the chance to work for the most important news organization in the world. And I have loved it. I have been able to collaborate with some of the most talented, passionate and creative journalists in the world. I’ve been so proud and grateful for what we’ve been able to accomplish together.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was hired as the first full-time audio producer at The Times, the audio department was just an idea, nurtured in an old closet with grey foam panels glued to the walls on the 16th floor. Now it is a pillar of The Times’ journalism and a model for the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with Lisa Tobin, Theo Balcomb, and Michael Barbaro, I helped create The Daily in 2017. Since then I’ve gone on to help create and develop series like Rabbit Hole with Kevin Roose and The Field with The Times’ politics team. And, of course, in 2018 I helped create and produce the most ambitious project I’ve ever worked on: Caliphate.</p><p>While I remain proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish with Caliphate, getting any aspect of any story wrong, by any degree, is a journalist’s worst nightmare. After Caliphate was corrected, in print and in audio, peers of mine in the audio industry, from outside of The Times, began to raise questions about why I had been allowed to remain in my position.&nbsp;</p><p>There are answers to these questions: When it came to fact-checking support for the project, the Times’ leadership told us that they had their own internal system in place for stories of this nature. That system broke down. And they did not blame us. In fact, throughout The Times’ reexamination of Caliphate, they told our production team that we’d engaged in rigorous and careful journalism. One masthead editor even made it a point to tell me: “I won’t let you blame yourself.”</p><p>But in the meantime, another story emerged online: that my lack of punishment came down to entitlement and male privilege. That accusation gave some the opportunity to resurface my past personal conduct.</p><p>Like all human beings, I have made mistakes that I wish I could take back. Nine years ago, when I first moved to New York City, I regularly attended monthly public radio meet up parties where I looked for love and eventually earned a reputation as a flirt. Eight years ago during a team meeting, I gave a colleague a back rub. Seven years ago I poured a drink on a coworker’s head at a drunken bar party. I look back at those actions with extraordinary regret and embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this happened while I was working at WNYC. When my managers there confronted me with how my unprofessional behavior was making people feel, I was ashamed. I apologized to the individuals that I’d learned I had upset or made uncomfortable. And I was punished. I received a warning from WNYC’s HR department that I needed to be more professional or look for work elsewhere. I was told to meet with a professional work-place trainer. I was a production assistant at the time, and the promotion to producer that I had been working toward was denied.&nbsp;</p><p>I took this reckoning seriously and I continued to work at WNYC for nearly two more years without further incident.&nbsp;</p><p>When I started working at The Times, in 2016, I was open with my bosses and colleagues about this experience and what I’d learned from it. They said that they appreciated my candor and defended me publicly, including in New York Magazine in 2018.</p><div><p>At The Times, I have strived to continue to grow and be a better co-worker and person, and not repeat the mistakes of my 20s. All of my reviews have reflected that. Each year as the team grew, I was promoted to higher levels of leadership. In December, my latest promotion was finalized: I was to become our audio department’s director of development. “Ride or die baby! I’m thrilled about this. You are a treasured colleague and an insane talent. So much to come! Looking forward to toasting,” wrote the assistant managing editor who oversees The New York Times’s audio report.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was not to be. The allegations on Twitter quickly escalated to the point where my actual shortcomings and past mistakes were replaced with gross exaggerations and baseless claims. Several people have even alleged that I am a predator and a dangerous threat to my colleagues. I have been transformed into a symbol of larger societal evils. As a journalist, it has been especially discouraging and upsetting to see fellow journalists make such claims or retweet them.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The entire experience has been extraordinarily painful. I know I’m not supposed to say that because people will claim that I’m trying to make myself the victim. I know that I still have a lot of room to grow as a person - I can be overly zealous and talk over people, making them feel unheard. I know that this whole letter opens me up to more public shaming and ridicule. But public shaming is very painful. That is the truth. So is leaving the job you love.</p><p>And yet, that’s what I feel I need to do. As the pressure of this online campaign has grown to encompass some staffers of The Times, it has led to a climate where, even though I still love the mission of this important institution, I feel it is in the best interest of both myself and my team that I leave the company at this time. I do this with no joy and a heavy heart.</p><p>To the journalists, editors, colleagues and friends who’ve reached out with words of encouragement and support over the past several weeks, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your calls and notes have meant more to me than you can know.</p><p>To all my colleagues with whom I’ve had the chance to collaborate on such important and ambitious journalism projects throughout these last several years, I will miss working with you dearly. I wish you all the very best. I will keep cheering you on.</p><p>At some point, maybe I’ll tell this story more fully, but I got into this work to tell other people’s stories. And for now, I’m going to get back to that.</p><p>Andy</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    


<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://stribny.name/images/blog/ansible-dev/cover.png" alt="Using Ansible to automatically configure a development machine"></p></div>
<p><em>Have you ever wanted to automate the tedious installation and configuration of programs that you use every day? Would you like to automate it so that you can do it again and again on multiple computers without much effort, e.g. when you get a new laptop? Would you like to update your configuration once and update all laptops and servers you use at once? Then read on as we set up a development machine together, using the automation tool Ansible.</em></p>
<h2>What we will achieve</h2>
<p>Setting up a new computer involves two main activities: installing software and configuring it. That's why I will focus on this two activities in the article. I will assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to install some software packages from different sources.</li>
<li>We have some dot files in a remote git repository that we want to download and copy to their respective locations.</li>
<li>We want to do it all automatically, so that we can get the same environment when setting up or updating a machine, be it our new laptop or a server.</li>
</ul>
<p>I picked some packages and configuration for illustration. What we install and use on our computers vary a lot, so consider this to be just a "getting started" example.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will install command line tools <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> for viewing files, <a href="https://the.exa.website/">exa</a> for listing directories and Vim. All of them provide much nicer experience than standard tools <code>cat</code>, <code>ls</code> and <code>vi</code>.</p>
<p>We will also install <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> as (more than) an alternative Docker client and because we like <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/tag/python/">Python</a>, we will make sure the package manager <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> is installed on the system too.</p>
<p>We will store and source our custom dot files (config files starting with <code>.</code>) from a remote Git repository. We will work with two such files: <code>.vimrc</code> for configuring Vim and <code>.aliases</code> for storing shell aliases.</p>
<p>In our Vim config we allow the movement of the cursor besides the last character on the line:</p>
<pre><code>set virtualedit=all
</code></pre>
<p>Our aliases will replace <code>ls</code> and <code>docker</code> commands with our newly installed alternatives:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> <span>ls</span><span>=</span><span>'exa -la'</span><br><span>alias</span> <span>docker</span><span>=</span>podman</code></pre>
<p>With that we will be able to still list directories with <code>ls</code>, but get a nicer output:</p>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://stribny.name/images/blog/ansible-dev/ls.png" alt="ls replaced with Exa"></p></div>
<p>To make it work we will need to move the config files from the remote repository to the correct locations like <code>~/.vimrc</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<h2>Using Ansible</h2>
<p>To make all of that happen, we will use <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>. It is an agent-less software automation tool that executes tasks on typically remote systems using SSH connections. It is often used to provision and configure servers, but as we will see - there are other use cases. We could do the same with plain <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/2019/07/automation-with-shell-scripts/">shell scripting</a>, however there are some advantages when using Ansible. It makes it easier to get a cross-platform solution if needed, can run on multiple different machines at once without much effort and provides automatic idempotency so that actions are not performed unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The article assumes that we are on Fedora, but we can easily tweak it for a different system by replacing <code>dnf</code> package manager and <code>dnf</code> Ansible module with a package manager for the respective system.</p>
<p>Let's start by installing Ansible:</p>
<pre><code><span>sudo</span> dnf <span>install</span> ansible -y </code></pre>
<p>If you want to test the example provided but you don't want to do it directly on your system, I wrote an article <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/provisioning-ansible-vagrant/">Provisioning machines locally with Ansible and Vagrant</a> where I explain how to run Ansible in a local virtual machine instead.</p>
<h2>Ansible playbook</h2>
<p>The basic Ansible artefact is an Ansible playbook. It is a YAML file defining a set of tasks that we want to perform. Besides the tasks themselves, a playbook can contain some additional configuration.</p>
<p>We will start with the following template:</p>
<pre><code><span>-</span> <span>hosts</span><span>:</span> localhost<br>  <span>become</span><span>:</span> yes<br>  <span>vars</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>'pstribny'</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>dotfiles_repo</span><span>:</span> <span>'git@github.com:stribny/dotfiles.git'</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>ssh_key</span><span>:</span> <span>'.ssh/id_rsa'</span><p>  <span>tasks</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Name of the task"</span><br>      <span>ansible_module</span><span>:</span> <br>        <span>module_parameter</span><span>:</span><br>          <span>-</span> value<br>          <span>-</span> value2<br>      <span>task_parameter</span><span>:</span> value</p></code></pre>
<p><code>hosts:</code> defines the set of machines where the tasks will be performed. As we are primarily interested to configure our own machine, we use <code>localhost</code> as the value. If we want to configure a remote machine, we can easily replace it with an IP address. There are also other options how to define what hosts to target, e.g. by specifying it on the command line when we run the Ansible playbook, or using an inventory file.</p>
<p><code>become: yes</code> will execute the defined tasks under the root user. We could also specify <code>become_user: user</code> if we want to execute the tasks under a specific user on the target machine.</p>
<p><code>vars:</code> lists our own variables that we can reuse throughout the playbook. <code>user</code> will be used later on to construct the path to the user's directory, <code>dotfiles_repo</code> points to a remote Git repository from where we will source our dot files and <code>ssh_key</code> is the path to an SSH key relative to the user's home directory that will grant the access to that repository. If you want to run the final playbook from the article, these are the values that you will need to replace.</p>
<p>The <code>tasks:</code> section of the playbook defines tasks. This is only an example for now, showing that every task will have a name, a set of parameters, and specify which Ansible module should perform the task. We will be using only build-in Ansible modules, so there is no need to install anything else. We can also see two types of values: a list of parameters or a single value can be provided depending on the parameter.</p>
<h3>Installing packages</h3>
<p>Ansible supports many package managers out of the box. We will now install the mentioned system packages for Fedora using <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html">dnf</a> module and Python packages using <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/pip_module.html">pip</a> module. The basic usage of these modules is the same, and it is also easy to change it to a different package manager. Ansible also features a <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html">package</a> module which would be handy when creating cross-platform configuration. Let's create the tasks:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>tasks</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Install system packages"</span><br>      <span>dnf</span><span>:</span> <br>        <span>name</span><span>:</span><br>          <span>-</span> vim <br>          <span>-</span> bat<br>          <span>-</span> exa<br>          <span>-</span> podman<br>        <span>state</span><span>:</span> latest<p>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Install Python packages"</span><br>      <span>pip</span><span>:</span><br>        <span>name</span><span>:</span><br>          <span>-</span> poetry<br>        <span>state</span><span>:</span> latest</p></code></pre>
<p>We just list the packages under <code>name:</code> and tell Ansible what should be the resulting <code>state:</code>. The basic state is <code>present</code> which will ensure that the particular package is installed on the system, but here we specify <code>latest</code> that will also upgrade a package if there is a new version.</p>
<h3>Downloading the git repository</h3>
<p>Checking out a remote git repository can be done with <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/git_module.html">git</a> module. We need to set <code>repo:</code> to our remote repository, e.g. on Github, and <code>dest:</code> to be the place where to put the downloaded files:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>tasks</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Check out dotfiles from repository"</span><br>      <span>git</span><span>:</span><br>        <span>repo</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ dotfiles_repo }}"</span><br>        <span>dest</span><span>:</span> ./tmp<span>-</span>dotfiles<br>        <span>accept_hostkey</span><span>:</span> yes<br>        <span>key_file</span><span>:</span> <span>"/home/{{ user }}/{{ ssh_key }}"</span><br>        <span>force</span><span>:</span> yes<br>      <span>delegate_to</span><span>:</span> localhost<br>      <span>run_once</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><br>      <span>become</span><span>:</span> no</code></pre>
<p>We can see the use of our variables in action. Ansible uses jinja2 syntax that will be familiar to Python programmers. All we need is to put our string in quotes and surround the variable itself with double curly braces, e.g. "{{ variable }}".</p>
<p><code>accept_hostkey: yes</code> and <code>key_file:</code> will make sure that our local SSH key is accepted by the remote host and vice versa.</p>
<p><code>force: yes</code> will discard any changes in the already cloned repository. This is because we only want to keep the temp directory as a copy and nothing else.</p>
<p><code>delegate_to:</code> makes the git module to clone the git repository locally instead of cloning it on the target machine. In our case when <code>hosts: localhost</code> point to the same machine it might feel weird, but if we target a remote machine it would suddenly make sense. In our case we don't want to transfer SSH keys to the remote machines and clone it there, we want to use our computer to clone the repository and copy the files to remote hosts afterwards.</p>
<p><code>run_once:</code> is here so that we could easily extend the number of machines we want to run it on. It will ensure that even if we are configuring 5 machines, the repository will be cloned just once.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>We need to place our configuration files in the correct locations. We want to place <code>.vimrc</code> in <code>~/.vimrc</code> and include <code>.aliases</code> in the Bash config file <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Let's start by copying both files to the home directory. This can be done via <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html">copy</a> module. We need to specify <code>src</code> and <code>dest</code> paths and optionally can also set file ownership and permissions.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>tasks</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Copy .vimrc"</span><br>      <span>copy</span><span>:</span><br>        <span>src</span><span>:</span> ./tmp<span>-</span>dotfiles/.vimrc<br>        <span>dest</span><span>:</span> <span>"/home/{{ user }}/.vimrc"</span><br>        <span>owner</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ user }}"</span><br>        <span>group</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ user }}"</span><br>        <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>'0644'</span><p>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Copy .aliases"</span><br>      <span>copy</span><span>:</span><br>        <span>src</span><span>:</span> ./tmp<span>-</span>dotfiles/.aliases<br>        <span>dest</span><span>:</span> <span>"/home/{{ user }}/.aliases"</span><br>        <span>owner</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ user }}"</span><br>        <span>group</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ user }}"</span><br>        <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>'0644'</span></p></code></pre>
<p>The <code>mode: '0644'</code> will make sure that the owner <code>{{ user }}</code> can both read and write to the file. We could forbid ourselves writing to the file if we would like to emphasize that the configuration should be changed in the dot files repository first. I like to keep it writable since sometimes we might want to just test something before commiting it.</p>
<p>If we need to synchronize a directory instead, Ansible has modules for that too, e.g. <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/synchronize_module.html">synchronize</a> module that I use for application deployment.</p>
<p>Now we need to solve the <code>~/.aliases</code> file that doesn't do anything on its own, unlike <code>~/vimrc</code> that will be picked up by Vim automatically. Instead of mixing our aliases file with <code>.bashrc</code>, we will include it with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>if</span> <span>[</span> -f ~/.aliases <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span><br>  <span>source</span> ~/.aliases<br><span>fi</span></code></pre>
<p>This simple Bash script will check whether a file <code>~/.aliases</code> exists and if so, executes it. To achieve that with Ansible we are going to use <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/blockinfile_module.html">blockinfile</a> module for replacing text blocks in files. If we would want to replace only one line, there is also <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/lineinfile_module.html">lineinfile</a> module.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>tasks</span><span>:</span><br>    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"Load aliases in .bashrc file"</span><br>      <span>blockinfile</span><span>:</span><br>        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>"/home/{{ user }}/.bashrc"</span><br>        <span>block</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span><span><br>          if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then<br>            source ~/.aliases<br>          fi</span></code></pre>
<p>The usage is simple, we just specify the …</p></div></div>

		<p>Note on Accessibility</p>
<p>There has been some concerns about the contrast on this blog, unfortunately some find it hard to read light text on a dark background while others prefer it. I am looking into getting accessibility options for the blog but until then if you prefer to read dark text on a light background, this post is available on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@crippledscholar/when-accessibility-gets-labeled-wasteful-e84b3f674043#.2g5vucmbh" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>So there’s a debate going on, on Twitter right now between disabled people and people who either claim to care about the environment and or just want to complain about “lazy people”</p>
<p>The tweet that started it all</p>

<p>Image Description: tweet with a picture of peeled oranges in plastic containers on a grocery store (whole foods) shelf. Tweet reads “If only nature could find a way to cover these oranges so we didn’t need to waste so much plastic on them”</p>
<p>The original tweet has been shared over 70,000 times. Whole Foods has apparently agreed to remove the prepeeled oranges from their stores. Environmentalists and those who hate laziness rejoice!</p>
<p>The problem is that this discourse completely ignores how preprepared food impacts people with disabilities. The most common complaints about the sale of these oranges is either the wastefulness of the additional packaging (which is true but somewhat misdirected as I’ll discuss later) or that anyone who buys this must be incomprehensibly lazy.</p>
<p>As a person with limited hand dexterity, I look at this and see an easier way to eat healthy food. I actively avoid eating oranges, not because I dislike them (they are definitely tasty) but because I have so much difficulty peeling them. Any attempt to peel an orange is likely to result in an unappetizing mess because I’ve squeezed the orange to hard while trying to maneuver it for peel removal.</p>
<p>I don’t have access to peeled oranges from my grocery store though I’d probably take advantage of them if I did. I do buy precut vegetables all the time because it is more convenient and safer for me to do so.</p>
<p>Preparing food with limited mobility is both hugely time consuming and potentially dangerous. While adapted cooking tools do exist to help offset those issues they are really expensive (I wrote about that <a href="https://crippledscholar.wordpress.com/2015/09/19/the-cost-of-unnessecarily-medicalizing-acts-of-daily-life/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Anything that helps make my regular acts of daily life safer and more convenient is always a plus. So I was one of a number of disabled people who pushed back against the wholesale shaming of preprepared foods. The responses I got were informative in looking at how nondisabled people disregard and try and shut down discussions of accessibility. Rebuttals to inserting disability and accessibility into the conversation included what I consider the most ridiculous attempt to maintain the moral high ground. It was,</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean accessibility is nice and all but you know that wasn’t the thinking behind this product. It wasn’t designed for disabled people.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what, that’s probably entirely true. Whole foods was probably trying to cater to the convenience aspect. This is supported by the fact that the protest against the product on environmental and anti-lazy grounds was so successful.</p>
<p>The thing is this argument is hilariously irrelevant. In fact it shows that things don’t need to be directly conceived as accessible products to function that way. In many way things that are accidentally accessible are better than things that are specifically designed to be. This is because things that are accidentally accessible are marketed and available to everyone and are thus likely to be more easily available that an accessible product which is likely only sold in specialized stores. Seriously, accessibility that requires no thought to implement is the best.</p>
<p>Other arguments I got were,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peeled oranges have a shorter shelf life so how convenient are they really?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is true and it indicates just how much planning has to go into living while disabled. I have to plan my meals around the fresh produce I buy more strictly that others because I buy some things precut. This can be inconvenient but it pales in comparison to being forced to rely more heavily on canned or other processed foods that have a longer shelf life. My disability doesn’t disappear just because a whole head of cauliflower will last longer in my fridge than smaller prepared florettes.</p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Peeled oranges are certainly going to cost more than unpeeled and isn’t that a barrier?</p></blockquote>
<p>Also true but here’s the thing, being disabled is expensive and costs for accessible products can be prohibitive. It is however easier to budget for the extra dollar or two that prepared fruits and vegetables are going to cost every couple weeks than the dozens or hundreds of dollars buying adapted cooking equipment will cost up front. This is a case where the cost should be the cause for protest not the cost being used as an excuse to protest the product. I’m all for my life being more affordable.</p>
<p>Other disabled activists dealt with other arguments. The person who argued most ardently with me was actually pretty tame and seemed more clueless than anything as they clearly didn’t think their arguments through and went away quietly when I calmly rebutted their arguments. Others were not so lucky. Things got a lot messier and ableist as Twitter user Ana Mardoll learned as she systematically tore apart those arguments (for a full view of this thread click <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaMardoll/status/705777638720167936" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Issues arose when protesters prioritized the environment over the experiences of disabled people. Though as Ana points out those plastic food containers are hardly new. They are a ubiquitous sight at any grocery store deli housing things like artisanal cheese, salads and mac &amp; cheese. Yet how is it that the wastefulness arguments crops up over something that is accessible, rather than the widespread use of plastic containers generally. Not to mention at least these look like the could be reused or repurposed. Where is the protest over bags of prepared salad? I guess peeling an orange is to easy but the convenience of salad in a plastic bag is to much to be denied.</p>
<p>Ana further points out that disability inherently comes with a greater need for product consumption. Disabled people need mobility aids and other tools that inevitably have an impact on the environment. Many of the people she encountered appeared to suggest that in the fight for the environment, disabled people are too inconvenient and should not be accommodated.</p>
<p>People who conceded that disabled people should be able to buy peeled and prepared food were sometimes still unwilling to give up the environmental angle and suggested that we should just ask the clerk at the register to peel the oranges upon purchase.</p>
<p>This is both an issue of hygiene because, I pretty sure those oranges in containers were peeled in an environment that was more controlled for hygiene than the store checkout where the clerk has been in contact with dozens of people and their money without the benefit of regular cleaning.</p>
<p>Also disabled people should not have to jump through additional hoops to get things which is both an unnecessary wate of time but forces us into a role where we must ask for help.</p>
<p>The issue here isn’t that the environment isn’t important. It absolutely is but environmentalism has most definitely ignored disability and accessibility. Basically if something is billed as environmental. It is almost certainly inaccessible. Consider the love affair with ogling (though mostly not actually moving into) <a href="http://inhabitat.com/6-eco-friendly-diy-homes-built-for-20k-or-less/" target="_blank">tiny houses</a>. No micro home is ever going to be wheelchair accessible and many of them depend on loft space accessed by a ladder for sleeping so even ambulatory people with limited mobility can’t use them. They are a popular trend in cutting the carbon footprint though. Downsizing generally is considered the easiest way to become more environmentally friendly. It is however just not really an option for disabled people where additional space and adapted devices are required for daily living.</p>
<p>Far to often if a location heavily touts its low environmental impact, you can assume it’s going to be inaccessible because they are cutting electrical use by not having things like an elevator.</p>
<p>I keep thinking of my stay at the <a href="http://theplanettraveler.com/" target="_blank">Planet Traveler Hostel</a> in Toronto several years ago while in town briefly for my sister’s wedding (before I moved here for school). It is touted as being very <a href="http://theplanettraveler.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank">environmentally friendly</a>. While there the owner bragged about all the environmental upgrades. The thing is you can’t get anywhere in the building without having to go up or down at least one and usually more flights of stairs. Stair that are narrow and pretty steep. I showed up the with my luggage and wearing my AFO so stairs not the greatest. I managed but it was uncomfortable and time consuming. If I was any less mobile than I am, it wouldn’t have been an option and I’d have had to beg family members for money to pay for a hotel (as I had been unemployed for over a year at that point and had spent the last of my money on the plane ticket)</p>
<p>I would love to see containers with prepared food get more environmentally friendly but more importantly environmentalists need to start considering disability and accessibility whether it be in finding more sustainable way to create the products we rely on to accessible sustainable housing. What I don’t want to see is people throwing disabled people under the bus because they’d rather get rid of a product than figure out a way to deliver it sustainably.</p>
<p>Also if your main concern over the peeled oranges was a rage over widespread laziness. Basically anything that benefits lazy people is going to be accessible to some degree so embrace the convenience (or just don’t buy it) and don’t add a level of shame to buying a product that actually makes our lives easier and which in conjunction with other similar products can actually improve our independence and quality of life.</p>
<p>Updated to add this horrendous defense</p>

<p>So basically disabled people should not be allowed to expect or demand better access to food because we never used to have it. *sigh*</p>
<p>and the argument is off …</p></div></div>

<p><span>
“A</span> good question is much more difficult than a brilliant answer.”
</p>
<p>
That’s a decent summation of Richard Saul Wurman’s life’s work. That <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/video/videos/ted-founder-richard-saul-wurman-its-question-not-answer" target="_blank">he said it</a> suggests he may think so, too. Wurman is probably best known for creating the <span>TED</span> conference, but in my estimation, <i>should</i> be best known for his work as a thinker about information.
</p>
<p>
In 1989, he published a book called <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/information-anxiety/oclc/18442022" target="_blank"><i>Information Anxiety</i></a>, which not only seeks to define a phenomenon created by an increasing volume of information within our daily lives, but also to summarize an inflection point for our culture. Take this passage, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
Information is power, a world currency upon which fortunes are made and lost. And we are in a frenzy to acquire it, firm in the belief that more information means more power. But just the opposite is proving to be the case. The glut has begun to obscure the radical distinctions between data and information, between facts and knowledge. Our perception channels are short-circuiting. We have a limited capacity to transmit and process images, which means that our perception of the world is inevitably distorted in that it is selective; we cannot notice everything. And the more images with which we are confronted, the more distorted is our view of the world.
</blockquote>
<p>
What strikes me now, over thirty years later, is how incredibly applicable this passage is to our time — how much of our culture for over a generation has been focused on this aggregate quest: a pursuit that <i>looks</i> like one of knowledge, but is really one of facts.
</p>
<p>
Hindsight also reveals a curious semantic twist on Wurman’s take. The word “we,” for a reader in 2021, has two objects. When Wurman writes of information that “we are in a frenzy to acquire it,” an easy contemporary interpretation is to read “we” as “our culture,” or more specifically, those who have the most power today to do the acquiring. If our culture is one of information-given power, then that power is held by a short list of massive corporations — Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. — who treat it as proprietary. Finders, keepers!
</p>
<p>
But then later, when Wurman writes that “we have a limited capacity to…process,” and that the more with which “we are confronted, the more distorted is our view of the world,” it is nearly impossible to not read those wes as us individually. You and I. We’d likely have not read it that way in 1989, but after decades of expanding our reach into the world’s information and then experiencing the unforeseen costs of doing so, a read informed by history is much more complicated, though no less grim.
</p>
<p>
In 1989, Wurman was concerned about the human experience resulting from an already information-hungry culture. The idea of <i>information anxiety</i> came from his observation of an “ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand.” What we <i>think</i> we should understand comes, of course, from the perception of available information. So consider, for a moment, what that looked like thirty years ago. In a 1989 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-22-tm-1044-story.html" target="_blank">review</a>, the <i>L.A. Times</i> summarized the world into which <i>Information Anxiety</i> was published quite nicely:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you went to the Library of Congress and looked at one book, manuscript or other library resource each minute eight hours a day, five days a week, it would take you more than 688 years to see all 85,895,835 items. (That’s up from 59,890,533 in 1969.) The size of the average American newspaper has more than doubled since 1970 to 91 pages, and we spend 45 minutes a day reading it—though that is just 10 minutes more than a decade ago. The average Sunday paper in 1970 had 145 pages; in 1986 it had 351.
</blockquote>
<p>
If that situation prompted enough anxiety to birth a book about it, imagine how much longer the litany had it been written <i>today</i> — if it included the web, texting, social media, e-books, streaming video, and on and on. Nevertheless, had it included the many forms and sources of information that cause us anxiety today, Wurman’s first step, to organize them all in only five different ways, would have been the same. He argues that all information can only be organized by <i>category</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>location</i>, <i>alphabet</i>, and <i>continuum</i>. When I first read that, I immediately resisted — <i>That can’t be!</i>, I thought — but the more I pondered it, the more I came back with examples that were really just another way of expressing of one Wurman’s five. (In particular, “continuum” threw me. Continuum is Wurman’s way of talking about arranging information by some kind of priority. For example, sorting a list of search results on Amazon by average customer rating is arranging by continuum. So is sorting by price.)
</p>
<p>
However unable I was to introduce a sixth means of organizing information, I was also stuck with a problem: which of these ways is how a search engine works? When Google makes good on its mission to “organize the world’s information,” how exactly does it do that? Once I get information <i>back</i> from Google’s search engine, I can, of course, sort it in some of the ways Wurman lists. But the most curious absence in the tools available to a searcher is <i>continuum</i>. I cannot sort results by any kind of priority or subjective rating. And yet, <i>continuum</i> of some kind is at the heart of how Google does it. The problem is, Google’s continuum is its trade secret.
</p>
<p>
That Google seeks to organize the world’s information, but doesn’t tell the world how it does it seems an almost self-defeating contradiction. But because most people find Google’s search results to be satisfactory and aren’t bothered by not knowing exactly how they produce them, Google has amassed an enormous amount of power. They control how we all find information. They also control what information we find.
</p>
<p>
<i>Is that good?</i>
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that there are many good reasons to answer that question with a quick and resounding “no.” That there should be a limit to the amount of power any individual or corporation is able to amass is becoming a more favored position in our culture. But that’s informed by ideas about distribution of power that stand apart from how we’d otherwise judge <i>how</i> an agent with power operates. But if we don’t <i>know</i> how they work, we can’t <i>judge</i> if how they work is good.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/professor-tobias-blanke" target="_blank">Tobias Blanke</a>, a philosopher and computer scientist, came to a similar conclusion fifteen years ago in an <a href="http://mishkenot.org.il/Hebrew/docs/ethics/003_blanke_ethics&amp;searchengines.pdf" target="_blank">ethical review of search engines</a>. Of Google specifically, he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
The full details of its algorithm are not known because of property rights, but an early paper of the two Google founders indicates that it is based not only on word occurrence statistics but also on a system of authorities and hubs. Authorities are web pages that are linked by many others, while hubs link themselves to many other pages. Web pages achieve a better ranking if they optimise their relation within this system of hubs and authorities.
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, Google’s algorithm is entirely based on a continuum method — of ordering information based upon a <i>perceived</i> priority. Google calls it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" target="_blank">PageRank</a>. They say that PageRank “works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve read those words many times over the course of my career as a designer; understanding search engines has been important to how I make things and advise that others make things because the persistent implied purpose of it all has always been to be found, to be seen, to be engaged with. But over the course of that time, how I’ve received this explanation of how Google works — the fundamental assumption they make about importance, especially — has radically changed. Fifteen years ago, while Tobias Blanke was asking the right questions, I’d have likely thought that organization by authority made good sense. Today, with the accumulated power Google has, it’s an outrageously cynical method with a wide-open back door.
</p>
<p>
Richard Saul Wurman does not include organization by authority for good reason. Authority is too subjective. It’s kicking continuum’s can. Authority vested by <i>whom</i>? Importance according to <i>what</i>?
</p>
<p>
Authority is also too vulnerable to exploitation.
</p>
<p>
Once you understand that information on the web will gain prominence as the number of other web pages linking to it increases, boosting prominence is a pretty easy thing to do. It may not be a <i>good</i> thing to do, but that’s not stopping anyone. An entire industry of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo" target="_blank">Black Hat</a> search engine optimization arose out of this vulnerability, using a very long list of tactics to get bad information to be treated as good by Google.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to exploit Google’s vulnerability, though, is not to bother messing with metadata — the information Google extracts from pages and the pages that link to them — but to <i>create</i> new information to manipulate Google’s perception of importance. That’s called Google bombing, and you’ve likely encountered or heard about it before as it’s been a pretty useful way of embarrassing political figures. Perhaps you remember the time that Googling “miserable failure” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bombing#/media/File:Google_Bomb_Miserable_Failure.png" target="_blank">returned George W. Bush’s own Whitehouse.gov biography</a>. Or when “liar” led to Tony Blair. Or, more recently, when “idiot” returned pictures of Donald Trump. There was a particularly famous Google bomb that connected Rick Santorum with bodily fluids. I’ll leave that to you to, well, Google for yourself.
</p>
<p>
The point is, PageRank, Google’s black box of information organization, is really a Pandora’s box. We don’t even need to know exactly what’s in there to know that its full of trouble.
</p>
<p>
Again, Blanke puts it well when he repeatedly stresses that the problem isn’t just the subjective nature of the search engine’s design, but the way in which that subjectivity is rendered: “The ethical problems of search engines do not begin with the fact that they decide about relevance but with how they decide about it.”
</p>
<p>
Subjectivity, after all, isn’t …</p></div></div>

		<p>Just in a couple of days one of the biggest software events <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM 2021</a> will take place, for the first time completely online. Hundreds of talks will originate from behind laptops, phones and workstations. Realization of this fact was the last link in the long chain of events leading to me writing this reference. Being a sound engineer by trade I, presumptuously, hope to attract attention of the speakers-to-be to the sound quality of their presentations. However, I tried to do my best to compile and present a generally useful reference, not a dumbed down step-by-step guide doomed to be rendered inapplicable by slightest variation of circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-guide-can-help-you">How this guide can help you</h2>
<p>2020 has been a year of video conferencing. More people than ever now work from their homes and socialize utilizing not just text, but video and sound. Technical details which once were of interest to those in media production, podcasting and streaming now also concern (or, at least, they should) much broader audience.</p>
<p>Whether you’re about to give a talk, stream your coding session, hop into a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">jitsi</a> meeting for your work, roll some d20s in an online tabletop session or just chat with friends, I hope this guide will help you to be heard.</p>

<p>Personally, I always liked lectures. Seeing and hearing a knowledgeable person explaining the topic of their interest with passion always makes a great impact on me. Especially if it sounds good. Unfortunately, in my opinion people pay much less attention to the quality of their sound than they should (compared to video), considering it’s not such a hard topic to understand. Few things frustrate me more than watching an hour-long video of a beautifully presented topic spoiled by low speech legibility, distortion and clipping, ridden with extraneous noises, copious reverberations and immoderate processing.</p>
<p>More and more educational and recreational material appear in video form and I’d like to share some of my knowledge to help bring up the overall quality of the sound of those videos at least a little bit.</p>

<p>The obvious first question one may ask is <strong>how this particular guide stands out</strong> from hundreds of others already available? Trying to answer it, I came to the following formula: This document will present a set of <strong>strategies</strong> (as opposed to directives) working towards a number of goals, while explaining the basics which are necessary to understand <em>why</em> we perform the described manipulations, thus empowering the reader with the knowledge to apply in the widest set of conditions.</p>
<p>The goals we set are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the legibility of recorded/streamed speech</li>
<li>Reduce extraneous noises, prevent distortion</li>
<li>Maintain natural timbre of you voice. Getting the ubiquitous voice-of-god is a non-goal!</li>
<li>At the same time, conform to listener expectations of what well-recorded voice sounds like (hint: it’s different from a person speaking live in the same physical space)</li>
<li>Make the sound fit the video naturally, not breaking listeners' expectations. If you type on video, people need to hear at least some hints to it happening (not loud). When your cat meows in-frame in complete silence it’s creepy. This is one of the reasons there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)">whole profession</a> of people adding sounds to videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a studio engineer and a musician, not a broadcasting engineer. I never worked on radio and I’ve never been a fan of my own voice to start a podcast. Some of the terms I use may differ from the broadcasting industry lingo. However, I’ve recorded speech and singing on many occasions in a vast range of circumstances and the techniques described are generic to all sub-fields of sound recording/processing. I also believe in a lifetime of learning, so I welcome any corrections and constructive critique.</p>

<p>Let’s consider the broad view of what’s happening when we capture and record a sound:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sound emanates from a source, be it a voice apparatus, musical instrument or a speaker cone</li>
<li>It travels through air in some acoustic space</li>
<li>The sound wave + reverberation (reflections from the surfaces) hit the microphone, where it all gets converted into an electric signal</li>
<li>The electric signal is amplified to a required level by a preamp (inside mic/mixer/audio interface/built-it sound card, possibly a few times)</li>
<li>The signal is converted by ADC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">analog-to-digital converter</a>) to a digital stream</li>
<li>Digital signal is processed in some way, ranging from a basic volume adjustment to a complete chain of effects</li>
<li>Processed signal is being encoded by some codec required by an end application</li>
</ol>
<p>The main thing we can notice about the process is that everything happens linearly, in other words, the sound passes all the steps <em>in order</em> (except the reverberation, which may introduce earlier sounds into currently happening ones, more on that in the Acoustics section). This brings us to several important observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process is cumulative, every step affects the result of all the previous steps</li>
<li>The earlier some characteristic is introduced into the process, the more potential effect it bears on the resulting sound</li>
<li>Each step may affect and transform the sound, but the ultimate effect is heavily dependent on the behaviour of the later stages</li>
<li>Manipulating the voice (“signal”) at a later stage of the process simultaneously affects all the unwanted sounds or sound characteristics (“noise”) picked-up/introduced by previous stages</li>
</ul>
<p>This probably reads too hand-wavy and vague, but we’re about to see time and time again how these realizations can help us make practical decisions.</p>
<h2 id="voice">Voice</h2>
<p>The golden rule applies: the better the source material, the better the result. Voice coaching is completely outside the scope of this reference, but just bear the rule in mind and please, read a little bit on voice health, especially if you need to speak regularly for considerable amounts of time. Everyone understands what speech characteristics people usually want to hear, so do your best but <strong>avoid strain</strong> at all costs, drink lots of water and don’t forget to breath from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="acoustics">Acoustics</h2>

    <figcaption>A plot of human speech directivity in a horizontal plane, frequency zone critical for legibility shown in yellow. Very rough approximation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Acoustics and acoustically treating the space in which the recording takes place is arguably the most important step of the whole process. It’s easy enough to test: try recording in vacuum and see how well it goes (on the second thought, don’t)! On a serious note, besides our voice, room acoustics is the most early introduced factor which we can really control to shape our sound.</p>
<p>The sound is the vibration of the medium, and our medium is air. So, while human speech has some significant directivity (see figure), the big portion of the sound travels in all directions. Then, it gets repeatedly reflected by the objects around us while some of the energy gets absorbed and dissipated to heat. Some of the reflections inevitably get back to the microphone (and our ears) and since the path of every bit of the reflected sound is longer, it takes more time to arrive. The sum of all the reflections arriving to the receiving end forms the unique signature of the space and this is how your boss knows you’re participating in a conference call from your bathroom.</p>
<p>The rate at which the objects hit by the sound waves dissipate the energy is called <strong>absorption</strong>. The sound gets absorbed differently depending on the frequency and the absorbing material. Generally, the higher the frequency, the easier it’s to absorb. The other important property is <strong>diffusion</strong>: the more geometrically complex the path of the reflected sound is and the more variation of the ways the sound reflects in a space there is, the more it gets “spread out” to a multitude of reflections of lesser energy and the less prominent each separate reflection is (note, this is technically not the exact definition of sound diffusion, just a simple way of conceptualizing the process).</p>
<p>What’s more, less diffused reverberation may further degrade speech legibility by introducing phasing issues such as <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-what-exactly-comb-filtering">comb filtering</a>. The closer the reflecting surface is to the microphone, the worse its going to affect the sound, as the reflection will be just slightly time shifted compared to the direct sound thus introducing more phasing artifacts. This is why internal laptop microphones will always sound bad - they catch the reflections from the screen surface and a table it’s usually placed on. With your smartphone you can also observe similar effect: try to record your voice with the phone laying on a hard surface and then lift it up in the air preserving the distance - there’s a great chance your voice will sound better.</p>
<p>The sound in an empty room is much more “echoey” than in a regular living room with lots of objects made from different materials for the two causes mentioned above: there’s not much absorption nor diffusion going on. The hard open surfaces of an empty room produce more direct reflections and preserve much more high frequencies. The geometry of the room itself also contributes: to put it simply, the sounds bounces more between parallel planes.</p>

    <figcaption>Getting closer to the microphone greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio due to a combination of various factors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What we want to is to increase the direct-to-reverberated sound ratio and “soften” the reverberation by diffusion, and now it’s obvious how to achieve that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decrease the distance from the sound source (your mouth) to the microphone. If you ever seen a loud band perform live (the older generation might still remember the times) and wondered why the singer vigorously tries to swallow the mic, this is it. Not only the direct sound gets louder compared to the reverberation and ambient noises, but we also somewhat physically shield the mic from the reflected sounds by our own head. There’s some caveats to this, more on that in the corresponding section.</li>
<li>Avoid rooms with lots open hard open surfaces, living rooms are …</li></ul></div></div></div>

Considering the cost of task switching, each notification could cause <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/12/12/deep-habits-the-danger-of-pseudo-depth/">28 minutes</a> of distraction. Even if 2% of incoming notifications are detrimental to our focus, we're probably losing 60+ minutes of focus per day to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597809000399">attention residue</a>. In the span of a year, that's 25 work-days of attention spent on...mobile push notifications.</p><p>When you think about notifications that you receive across <em>all</em> your digital devices, you can see the magnitude of the problem. If we were to count all our notifications in a day, I'm certain that the number would surprise us. <a href="https://3am.link/turn-off-your-phone-notifications/">This post</a> dives deeper into it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/582513cb35d0a957501af08f/5ff7de44e6e71963b5218be2_notifications_02.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Based on my personal phone stats, I often have days with 300+ notifications.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>While <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/push-notifications/research/push-notifications-statistics/">82%</a>&nbsp;of people don't always find notifications useful, we can't afford to totally ignore push notifications.

I set a fixed schedule on my phone to mute specific applications, but I still have a lot of FOMO and find myself clicking through various applications to make sure I haven't missed important messages from friends or family.</p><p>‍</p><p>One way to solve for this is to take inspiration from email inboxes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nobody likes an addendum.</p>
<p>Appendices are great (ask any Tolkien fan). P.S.'s are <em>the best</em> (especially if they're from a penpal).</p>
<p>But addendums. Nope. They change the rules, after you've started playing. After the game's over, even.</p>
<p>I recently got dropped with this whopper of an addendum:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Orcein stains performed on blocks A3 and A5 highlight elastic fibers
wrapping around nests of tumor cells, consistent with vascular invasion</code></pre></div>
<h2>A lil' background</h2>
<p>Previously, on "Halt and Catch Cancer", I thought I was in the clear. Sure, I'd been <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/colon-cancer">diagnosed with Stage II colon cancer at age 34</a>. But the neato robotic surgery to remove my sigmoid colon (and my grisly barnacle of a tumor) was successful, with no signs of the cancer spreading to the nearby lymph nodes (which are essentially the Information Superhighway of your body's immune system).</p>
<p>Officially, we're talking a PT3N0 pathology, where N means the number of lymph nodes with tumor cells (zero, in my case, of the 21 that were removed and inspected) and T means the levels of colon wall that the tumor "broke through." N0 is awesome and T3 is not-so-awesome. My tumor was pretty darn close to breaking through the colon wall. But the fact that I had no lymph nodes affected was a good sign -- a good enough sign that no chemotheraphy was being recommended by my USCF doctor crew.</p>
<p>Now, after my blog post on this whole "cancer sitch," I'd been in touch with friends and other wood-workers who were, unfortunately, familiar with this process. One, in particular, has been highly tuned into the research and literature around colon cancer, and he pushed me to make sure I fully understood my pathology. He also mentioned that he's seen folks with my PT3N0 pathology do chemotherapy on a preventative basis. Given that my big missive in my last post was about "becoming your own health advocate," his advice hit hard, because I was already lapsing in my attentiveness. Frankly, I was exhausted from the surgery, relieved by the results, ready to move on, and the pathology report itself was confusing af.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what? I'm just going to paste it here:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
Sigmoid colon, sigmoid colectomy:
1. Adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated, invasive through
muscularis propria into pericolic adipose tissue, negative margins; see
comment.
2. No tumor in twenty-one lymph nodes (0/21).
COMMENT:
COLON CARCINOMA SYNOPTIC COMMENT
- Procedure: Sigmoid colectomy.
Result Information
All Reviewers List
Pathology PDF Report
Narrative &amp; Impression
Harrington, Charles
- Location of tumor: Sigmoid colon.
- Tumor size: 3.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm.
- Macroscopic tumor perforation: Not identified.
- Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma.
- Histologic Grade: Moderately-differentiated (low grade).
- Microscopic depth of invasion: Tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into pericolic soft tissue (pT3).
- Margins: Negative.
 - Proximal margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 4 cm from margin).
 - Distal margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 4 cm from margin).
 - Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 3 cm from
margin).
- Treatment effect (modified Ryan score, scale 0-3): No known
presurgical therapy.
- Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified on H&amp;E (orcein stains will
be performed on blocks A3 and A5, and the results will be reported as an
addendum).
- Perineural invasion: None.
- Tumor Deposits: Not identified.
- Lymph node status: Negative (number of lymph nodes examined: 21).
- Other pathologic findings: None identified.
- AJCC Pathologic Stage: pT3N0.
- Ancillary studies: Immunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch repair
proteins will be reported in an addendum.

Addendum Comment
Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA
mismatch repair protein expression on block A3. The results in the tumor
cell nuclei are:
MLH1 expression: Present.
PMS2 expression: Present.
MSH2 expression: Present.
MSH6 expression: Present.
Expression for all four markers, in most cases, indicates that the DNA
mismatch repair proteins are intact. This result should be correlated
with the clinical presentation and family history to determine the need
for further work up for Lynch syndrome</code></pre></div>
<p>Probably TMI, but this will actually be easier for me to find later, instead of spelunking through the oh-so-painful EPIC MyChart software. Am I allowed to share this? I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE.</p>
<p>As you can see, this plaintext nightmare is full of strange and wonderous medical terms. Yes, the doctors walk you through it but still... it's a lot. I did push them to explain the terms, like what negative margins mean and why they're a good thing, although I kind of forget already so I won't try to explain.</p>
<p>After this walk-through with the docs, I felt good about my plan. No chemo needed. Just ongoing tests and CT scans and blood work and colonoscopies over the next five years to make sure that the cancer wasn't back, led by the UCSF Cancer Survivorship Clinic. Sure, that wasn't nothing, but it also isn't that bad, considering how lucky I am to have caught this thing and gotten it removed ASAP. The idea was, after five years, I'd be back in the general population for risk of colon cancer. <em>Cured</em>.</p>
<p>But then, during my first Survivorship Clinic convo in November, I recalled that one line from the pathology... the one mentioning the addendum that I hadn't yet seen. I ask about it. We dig in, and we find this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Addendum Comment
Orcein stains performed on blocks A3 and A5 highlight elastic fibers
wrapping around nests of tumor cells, consistent with vascular invasion</code></pre></div>
<p><code>Consistent with vascular invasion</code>. Welp, that can't be good.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm immediately whisked off the UCSF Oncology Department.</p>
<h2>New faces and new tests and new plans</h2>
<p>A hospital is a series of interconnected rings, all slightly Venn Diagramming each other, kind of like the Olympics logo. As a patient, you tend to orbit one of the rings. But sometimes you'll Three Body Problem your way over to another ring.</p>
<p>In my entire diagnosis and surgery process, I'd never made it over to the Oncology (aka cancer) ring -- I was stuck in Surgery World. But, after this addendum, I'm now squarely in their circle.</p>
<p>So, what's our goal now? Well, now that we've noticed that my cancer has slightly spread into the vascular system, we need to figure out what to do about it. First, let's remember the good stuff - the rest of the pathology is relatively awesome. Next, let's get some more data!</p>
<p>We do these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signatera - looks in your blood for tumor cells</li>
<li>Oncotype - looks at your tumor and rates the likelihood of recurrence</li>

<p>Let me reiterate that my explanations of these tests (and anything medical-related) is entirely my random-dudeman-laymen's explanation. I hope to provide one person's context and interpretation of these confusing and scary things. I'm open to feedback and information on what I can do better.</p>

<h3>Insurance aside</h3>
<p>Insurance didn't want to cover the Oncotype test, because, of course. Insurance doesn't want to cover a lot of things, especially brand new "cutting edge" stuff, like the Oncotype test.</p>
<p>Instead, insurance wants to make sure that you really-super-duper-need whatever it is they're going to give you, to the point where there's basically no way they can say no. My doctors have been amazing advocates for me, helping make sure that insurance knows how important these tests and treatments are for my health. THANK YOU, UCSF.</p>
<p>Insurance is frustrating and scary. I do not understand it. I do not want to understand it. I wish it was simpler. I wish I didn't have to make sure that I was "covered" for things related to my health and my family's health. I also know that I'm incredibly lucky to have good insurance. I took a screenshot from my insurance app back in December:</p>

<p>WTF. That's an insane amount of money. But my life was saved, sooo...? The insurance company even assigned me a nurse to "check in on me" as a resource back in November and December, which sadly was more of a nuisance than anything else. And, then, when my company switched insurance providers at the beginning of 2021, this nurse service stopped abruptly. The whole thing's odd. But I can say again that I am extremely grateful to have had good insurance during my cancer treatment.</p>
<h3>Make a new plan</h3>
<p>The Signatera is clear, which is great. No circulating tumor cells in my blood. I ask the question, "Doesn't this mean I'm, like, good for life now?" And apparently no. They can't say that. They can only say, "We don't see anything right now." It's the balance sheet of cancer. Just cause things look good right now doesn't mean that next year or next quarter's gonna be the same. Past performance is no indication of future something-something.</p>
<p>Oncotype's pretty good, too. From what the doc explains, this test suggests that my tumor has a 12% recurrence rate. This is a low number and I should be happy about it. And I am. But I want it to be zero, obviously. Also, recurrence isn't talking about new polyps growing in my butt and starting cancers -- that can still happen. Recurrence is about whether cells from my now-removed cancer tumor are going rear their awful heads again, somewhere else in my body.</p>
<p>It's at this point that we get into the discussion around chemo. There's evidence that chemo can help reduce the recurrence rate even further. My oncology team brings my data to this cool-sounding UCSF "Tumor Board" meeting, and they advise a chemo treatment. The evidence suggests that we can bring down my recurrance rate from 12% to 6%.</p>
<p>But they also reiterate that it's my choice. I can say no. As my aforementioned friend said, "You don't do chemo recreationally." In fact, the doctors explain that if I were an old man, they might not advise treatment. But since I'm young and restless, it makes more sense for me to do whatever I can to improve my chances.</p>
<p>Duh, let's do this thing.</p>
<h2>So, what's chemotherapy like?</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, there's all different kinds of chemo. I didn't know that. I'm on a combo …</p></div></div>

February 5, 2021 | https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-01_cross-compile-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-01_cross-compile-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Over the past year I build a number of tools and utilities in Rust. Previously, I would mostly do this in node.js or shell scripts but Rust has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More reliable for long running and mostly unubserved applications (“once it runs is runs”), in particular no memory (leak) issues</li>
<li>Needs less resources, upping the utility value of my various Raspberry Pis</li>
<li>Setup and deployment are simple mostly due to the cargo package management and build tool</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point I’ll describe in more detail. In particular, the project setup around file / directory organization, package tooling and cross-compilation. Rust has comparatively strict (but in my oppinion well designed) best practices and “opinionated” defaults. Most of them come simply with the tools you use: <code>cargo run</code> expects binaries to be defined in certain ways for example.</p>
<p>To make this a little more concrete I will use my last holiday project as an example. <code>fritzctrl</code> wraps the API of <a href="https://en.avm.de/products/fritzdect/">AVM Fritz devices</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> into a command line utility that allows to schedule turning on and off outlets and controlling thermostats. The code is open source and can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/rksm/fritz-homeautomation-rs">github repository</a>. This project is still quite small (~1000 loc), yet I took care to follow common guidelines when organizing the code base to allow the project to be easily maintained and grown in the future.</p>
<h2 id="project-organization">Project organization</h2>
<p>Apart from github, the fritzctrl command line utility was also <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fritzctrl">added to crates.io</a> which allows installing it by running <code>cargo install fritzctrl</code> (this requires a local rust installation via rustup). This is all that is needed to get the utility installed - cargo will put it into it’s binary location (<code>~/.cargo/bin/</code>) that one can add to <code>PATH</code>. From that point on the utility is ready to use.</p>
<p>While building the tool I started to split up the user interface related code and the code that provides an interface (to the <a href="https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf">slightly obscure</a>) Fritz API. The latter was published in a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fritzapi">separate crate</a> which allows other projects to directly interface with that. The recommended way of organizing a project into mulitple crates and libraries / binaries is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html">cargo feature called workspaces</a>.</p>
<p>Note that organizing a project into a workspace is not absolutely necessary to separate the code. You can easily define one or many <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#binaries">binaries</a> simply by putting <code>.rs</code> files into <code>src/bin/</code>. You can even use subdirectories if you want a binary to have sub-modules. But if your binary starts to have extra dependencies that are not required for the library, things get a bit more complicated. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35711044/how-can-i-specify-binary-only-dependencies">this stackoverflow answer</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Since workspaces are very well supported by cargo and related tooling, it’s advisable to go down that route if in doubt.</p>
<p>In case of my project the structure looks like this: The top-level <code>Cargo.toml</code> just points to the <code>fritzapi</code> and <code>fritzctrl</code> dirs. <code>fritzctrl/Cargo.toml</code> references the lib via <code>fritzapi = { path = "../fritzapi", version = "0.3" }</code>. Note that there is also a version number, this will be used when the crate gets published and installed by other users via cargo. The path dependency is what gets when installing the crate locally.</p>
<pre><code>├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
├── fritzapi
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Cargo.toml
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── README.md  &lt;== generated using cargo readme
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── src
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── ...
└── fritzctrl
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Cargo.toml
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── README.md  &lt;== generated using cargo readme
 &nbsp;&nbsp; └── src
 &nbsp;&nbsp;     └── ...
</code></pre><p>The project can be easily build an run from the workspace root directory. <code>cargo run</code>, <code>cargo test</code>, <code>cargo doc</code> etc. all work as expected.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-to-cratesio">Publishing to crates.io</h2>
<p>If you have used a package management system like npm, crates.io will be quite familiar. You’ll first need to login to the <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io website</a>, which requires a github account. You then need to confirm your email address. Afterwards you can generate a token that when used on the command line with <code>cargo login</code>, allows you to publish and update crates. The <code>cargo publish</code> command can be run inside a project directory and will check and upload your project. However, I would recommend the <a href="https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release">cargo release plugin</a> which automates some housekeeping tasks around publishing. It’ll bump versions (across all packages when run from a workspace root!), git tag and upload. It’s very handy, I like it a lot.</p>
<p>While we’re talking about cargo plugins: I can also recommend <a href="https://github.com/livioribeiro/cargo-readme">cargo readme</a> which extracts rustdoc comments into markdown format that can be put directly into a <code>README.md</code> file. This will be automatically picked up by crates.io and will be what is visible on the project page such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fritzctrl">crates.io/crates/fritzctrl</a>. All of the content there was extracted from <a href="https://github.com/rksm/fritz-homeautomation-rs/blob/master/fritzctrl/src/main.rs"><code>fritzctrl/src/main.rs</code></a> with <code>cd path/to/fritzctrl; cargo readme &gt; README.md</code>.</p>
<p>In order to publish a new version of bothe fritzctrl and fritzapi I would then commit all changes and switch to the workspace root directory of the project. There I’ll run <code>cargo release --dry-run -vv --no-dev-version patch</code> which provides a preview of the release commands that would be run.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-01_cross-compile-rust/cargo-release.png"> 
</figure>

<p>If all looks good just run without the dry-run option and you should be done!</p>
<h2 id="cross-compiling">Cross-compiling</h2>
<p>A big reason for me to choose rust is the ability to create stand-alone binaries that can simply be copied onto a server, into a docker container or onto a Raspberry Pi without much installation overhead in the deploy environment. For this project, my main deployment target is a Raspberry version 2 that’ll run a <code>fritzctrl schedule</code> command to turn my outside lighting on and off at sunrise and sunset. rpi’s are awesome and very capable devices but compiling a lot of code will take ages. So setting a up cross-compilation to an arm target was part of the project.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to make sure the stdlib for the target architecture is installed. For the purpose of targeting a Raspberry Pi 2, the arvmv7 target will do. You can either use the gnu or musl variant, I used</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
</code></pre></div><p>This alone didn’t do as dependencies also required to be compiled natively using gcc. The gcc of your host system (MacOS in my case) will not be able to output the right format and might even have an incombatible compiler / linker interface. So you’ll likely need to install a gcc toolchain as well. Over at (lisa.musl.cc)(<a href="https://lisa.musl.cc/9.3.0/">https://lisa.musl.cc/9.3.0/</a>) you can download <code>arm-linux-musleabi-cross.tgz</code> which will contain gcc and linker binaries (the binaries from <a href="https://mac.musl.cc/">mac.musl.cc</a> did not work for me for some reason).</p>
<p>Then, we’ll need to inform cargo to use a different linker. Create a file <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> and specify the linker, in my case the file looks like</p>
<pre><code>[target.armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf]
linker = "armv7l-linux-musleabihf-ld"
</code></pre><p>Now the last step is to run <code>cargo build</code> using the arm targe <em>and</em> making sure that the different linker can be found:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">PATH<span>=</span>/path/to/arm-linux-musleabi-cross/bin:$PATH cargo build --release --target<span>=</span>armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
</code></pre></div><p>When you run that on MacOS you’ll probably see a MacOS warning like:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-01_cross-compile-rust/toolchain-warning.png" width="280"> 
</figure>

<p>You’ll need to open the MacOS Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy and allow the binary to run.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-01_cross-compile-rust/toolchain-warning-2.png" width="520"> 
</figure>

<p>If everything works you should end up with a binary in <code>target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/release/</code>. You should then be able to copy that binary directly onto the target machine and run it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/release/fritzctl rpi:bin/fritzctl
$ ssh rpi
pi@rpi-home:~ $ ./bin/fritzctl
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For other architectures you’ll need to install the appropriate targets such as <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> for example. <code>rustup</code> makes this very straightforward. I have some build issues from time to time with crates that have native dependencies. However, more and more crates now run purely on Rust or provide features to use pure rust dependencies.</p>
<p>If you need an http client for example, the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest">reqwest crate</a> will allow to be build using <code>rustls-tls</code> instead of <code>rust-native-tls</code> which might make it easier to compile.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Rust is fun to work with not just because the language is well designed but also the accompanying tooling is well thought out. Rust and in particular cargo come with a number of “opinionated” defaults such as how projects are organized that (at least if you agree with and follow them) make it quite straightforward to setup and deploy projects. I’ve never been a fan of strict rules around build systems, in the case of Rust I do, however. This might be because those guidelines come in a large part from the learnings of other such systems like node.js / npm and try to enshrine the best practices used there. Additionally, cargo and rustup are excellent and well documented tools (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">the cargo book</a> is quite helpful). I look forward to build many more systems in the Rust ecosystem.</p>

<![CDATA[Implementer's Guide to WebSockets]]>

February 5, 2021 | https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-websockets.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-websockets.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	This time I implemented WebSocket support for 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	Soon came to realize that when implementing WebSockets from
	scratch there is no go-to-and-know-everything resource available
	on the internet. Most of the resources just use third-party
	libraries and don't show how to implement the underlying
	network protocol and frame parsing mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
	Also, reading the RFC is kinda tedious, so I'm trying my best to
	have enough code demos available for clarifications. This guide
	tries to cover everything when it comes to the current WS13
	network protocol, including reserved frames and how to support
	them in future.
</p>
<p>
	Most people will most likely use socket.io, but from my personal
	view I wouldn't recommend it. In my use cases I use WebSockets
	peer-to-peer (yes, you can, despite everybody else claiming no),
	and the whole dependency tree of socket.io is rather redundant
	than performant.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides
	are implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>WS13</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a> 
	and that there were a couple of legacy versions of Web Browsers around
	for a while that implemented the websocket protocol in a buggy manner.
</p>
<p>
	This is not the case anymore and I will completely ignore your shitty
	Safari from the dark ages here (it's 2019, not 2011 after all).
</p>
<p>
	The Web-Socket Protocol is a web protocol that uses HTTP's 
	 <code>Upgrade</code>
	mechanism in order to upgrade a connection. That means the first request
	to the server is actually an HTTP request with the 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	and 
	 <code>Upgrade: websocket</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	If the server has a specialized service-oriented architecture that
	needs more than just websocket data frames in order to work, it is
	good to implement it as a so-called sub protocol.
</p>
<p>These subprotocols can be used in the Web Browser, too.</p>
<pre>// Browser Example
let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:12345', [
	'me-want-cookies' // Sub-Protocol
]);

let data = JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' });
let blob = new Uint8Array(8);

socket.send(data); // Text Frame
socket.send(blob); // Binary Frame
</pre>
<h2>Web-Socket Server</h2>
<p>The demo will be implemented in modern node.js.</p>
<p>
	The server creation has to be done with the 
	 <code>net.Server()</code>
	 interface,
	as the data that we need to access is 
	 <code>raw TCP data</code>
	 and our library
	will have to support binary encodings.
</p>
<p>
	It is important that the TCP connection is modified to fit our needs
	in order to never timeout. The WS13 protocol uses a 
	 <code>Ping Frame</code>
	 and
	a 
	 <code>Pong Frame</code>
	 which we have to manage ourselves, so we need to tell
	the TCP networking stack that by setting 
	 <code>socket.allowHalfOpen</code>
	 to 
	 <code>true</code>
	and by calling 
	 <code>socket.setTimeout(0)</code>
	 and 
	 <code>socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0)</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	As node.js runs 
	 <code>libuv</code>
	 in the background, which is of asynchronous
	nature, we also have to make sure that everything gets send as soon
	as possible by calling 
	 <code>socket.setNoDelay(true)</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs
import net    from 'net';
import { WS } from './WS.mjs';


// Chapter: Opening Handshake
const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};
	return headers;

};

let server = new net.Server({
	allowHalfOpen:  true,
	pauseOnConnect: true
});

server.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {

	socket.on('data', (buffer) =&gt; {

		let headers = parse_opening_handshake(buffer);
		if (
			headers['connection'] === 'Upgrade'
			&amp;&amp; headers['upgrade'] === 'websocket'
			&amp;&amp; headers['sec-websocket-protocol'] === 'me-want-cookies'
		) {

			WS.upgrade(socket, headers, (result) =&gt; {

				if (result === true) {

					console.log('WS.upgrade() successful.');

					socket.allowHalfOpen = true;
					socket.setTimeout(0);
					socket.setNoDelay(true);
					socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0);

					socket.removeAllListeners('timeout');
					socket.removeAllListeners('data');

					socket.on('data', buffer =&gt; {

						WS.receive(socket, buffer, request =&gt; {
							console.log('Received request ', request);
						});

					});

				} else {

					console.error('WS.upgrade() unsuccessful.');
					console.error('Sorry, no HTTP allowed either, yo');

					socket.end();

				}

			});

		} else {

			console.error('Sorry, no TCP allowed, yo');

			socket.end();

		}

	});

	socket.on('error',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('close',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('timeout', () =&gt; socket.close());

	socket.resume();

});

server.on('error', () =&gt; server.close());
server.on('close', () =&gt; (server = null));

server.listen(12345, null);
</pre>
<h2>Opening Handshake</h2>
<p>
	The initial request that is done via HTTP is conform to 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	,
	so it is very easy to parse and the payload is encoded in 
	 <code>utf8</code>
	and not 
	 <code>binary</code>
	, which eases up the parsing process.
</p>
<p>
	The headers are - as every network byte ordered data - separated
	by 
	 <code>\r\n</code>
	 after each line, which means it's best to simply parse
	line-by-line and just trim everything off to have margin for
	malformed but recoverable handshakes.
</p>
<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cookie.engineer
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: http://localhost:12345
Sec-WebSocket-Key: bm9tbm9tCg==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</pre>
<p>
	The header parsing mechanism for 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	 is quite easy,
	as it's just utf8 encoded data that has a trailing 
	 <code>\r\n\r\n</code>
	following its headers section.
</p>
<p>
	Fragmented frames always have this, but you never know what
	kind of script kiddie is challenging your server - so it's
	good to have a failsafe parsing mechanism in place.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs

const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};

	let req = buffer.toString('utf8');
	let raw = req.split('\n').map((line) =&gt; line.trim());

	if (raw[0].includes('HTTP/1.1')) {

		raw.slice(1).filter((line) =&gt; line.trim() !== '').forEach((line) =&gt; {

			let key = line.split(':')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
			let val = line.split(':').slice(1).join(':').trim();

			headers[key] = val;

		});

	}

	return headers;

};
</pre>
<h2>Connection Upgrade</h2>
<p>
	After the initial Opening Handshake request, it's expected to send
	the handshake verification back to the client.
</p>
<p>
	The handshake response contains the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</code>
	 header
	and the 
	 <code>Upgrade: WebSocket</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	 as well.

	Web-Socket Frames can be a bit complicated when just looking at
	the figure. Here's a bullet-point list of what to remember
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frames can be fragmented (because of TCP), so the first bit is the <code>fin</code> flag.</li>
	<li>The <code>rsv1</code> , <code>rsv2</code> and <code>rsv3</code> are Web-Socket Extension flags. If set to <code>1</code> , the payload can be processed differently.</li>
	<li>The <code>opcode</code> decides what kind of Web-Socket frame follows.</li>
	<li>The <code>client-to-server</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> decides whether or not the payload needs to be XOR-masked.</li>
	<li>The <code>masking key</code> is <code>32 bits</code> long (4 bytes). It is only transferred when <code>mask flag</code> is set to <code>1</code> .</li>
	<li>The <code>server-to-client</code> …</li></ul></article></div>

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) are the unifying attributes of an information security program.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Collectively referred to as the CIA triad of CIA security model, each attribute represents a fundamental objective of information security. The <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)</a> defines the relation between information security and the CIA triad as follows:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term “information security” means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide:</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; <strong>Integrity</strong>, which means guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information nonrepudiation, accuracy, and authenticity;</p>

<p>B.&nbsp; <strong>Confidentiality</strong>, which means preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including a means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information; and</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; <strong>Availability</strong>, which means ensuring timely and reliable access to, and use of, information.</p>
<p>You may be wondering which is most important. The answer requires an organization to assess its mission, evaluate its services, and consider regulations and contractual agreements. Organizations may consider all three components of the CIA triad equally important, in which case resources must be allocated proportionately.</p>
<h3>What is Confidentiality?</h3>
<p>As it pertains to information security, confidentially is the protection of information from unauthorized people and processes. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Code 44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542</a> defines confidentiality as “preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.”</p>
<p>None of us like the thought of our private health information or financial information falling into some stranger’s hands. No business owner likes the thought of her proprietary business information being disclosed to competitors. Information is valuable.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is a relatively easy, low-risk, high-reward venture. There is plenty of money to be made. The chances of being caught are slim. The tools are readily available. Criminals look for and are prepared to exploit weaknesses in network designs, software, communication channels, and people. The opportunities are plentiful. Criminals are not always outsiders. Insiders can be tempted to “make copies” of information they have access to for financial gain, notoriety, or to “make a statement.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to obtain unauthorized access is often opportunist. In this context, opportunistic means taking advantage of identified weaknesses. Criminals (and nosy employees) care about the work factor, which is defined as how much effort is needed to complete a task. The longer it takes to obtain unauthorized access, the greater the chance of being caught. The more a “job” costs to successfully complete, the less profit earned.</p>
<p>The information security goal of confidentiality is to protect information from unauthorized access and misuse.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to implement safeguards and processes that increase the work factor and the chance of being caught. This calls for a <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/blog/creating-a-cybersecurity-culture-part-4-technology">spectrum of access controls and protection</a> as well as <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/ndiscovery">ongoing monitoring</a>, <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/services/cyber-assessment">testing</a>, and <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/services/cybersecurity-training-and-education">training</a>.</p>
<h3>What is Integrity?</h3>
<p>Whenever the word integrity comes to mind, so does Brian De Palma’s classic 1987 film The Untouchables, staring Kevin Costner and Sean Connery. The film is about a group of police officers who could not be “bought off” by organized crime. They were incorruptible. Integrity is certainly one of the highest ideals of personal character. When we say someone has integrity, we mean she lives her life according to a code of ethics; she can be trusted to behave in certain ways in certain situations. It is interesting to note that those to whom we ascribe the quality of integrity can be trusted with our confidential information. As for information security, integrity has a very similar meaning. Integrity is the protection of information, processes, or systems from intentional or accidental unauthorized modification. In the same way we count on people to behave a certain way, we rely on our information to be a certain way.</p>
<p><strong>Data integrity</strong> is a requirement that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner. In other words, is the information the same as it was intended to be? For example, if you save a file with important information that must be relayed to members of your organization, but someone opens the file and changes some or all of the information, the file has lost its integrity. The consequences could be anything from coworkers missing a meeting you planned for a specific date and time, to 50,000 machine parts being produced with the wrong dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>System integrity</strong> is a requirement that a system “performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.” A piece of malware that corrupts some of the system files required to “boot” the computer is an example of deliberate unauthorized manipulation.</p>
<p>Errors and omission are an important threat to data and system integrity. These errors are caused not only by data entry clerks processing hundreds of transactions per day, but also by all types of users who create and edit data and code. Even the most sophisticated programs cannot detect all types of input errors or omissions. In some cases, the error is the threat, such as a data entry error or a programming error that crashes a system. In other cases, the errors create vulnerabilities. Programming and development errors, often called “bugs,” can range in severity from benign to catastrophic.</p>
<p>Integrity and confidentiality are interrelated. If a user password is disclosed to the wrong person, that person could in turn manipulate, delete, or destroy data after gaining access to the system with the password he obtained. Many of the same vulnerabilities that threaten integrity also threaten confidentiality. Most notable, though, is human errors. Safeguards that protect against the loss of integrity include access control such as encryption and digital signatures, process controls such as code testing, monitoring controls such as file integrity monitoring and <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/ndiscovery">log analysis</a>, and behavioral controls such as separation of duties, rotation of duties, and training.</p>
<h3>What is Availability?</h3>
<p>The final component of the CIA triad is also most often left out of consideration when one thinks about security. But, what does it mean to be secure? Would you feel secure if your car failed to start? Would you feel secure if you were very sick and your doctor could not be found? Whether or not systems and data are available for use is just as crucial as the confidentiality and integrity of the data itself. Availability is the assurance that systems and data are accessible by authorized users when needed. If we can’t access the data we need, when we need it, we are not secure.</p>
<p>Just like confidentiality and integrity, we prize availability. We want our friends and family to be there when we need them, we want food and drink available, we want our money available and so forth. In some case our lives depend on the availability of these things, including information. Ask yourself how you would feel if you needed immediate medical care and your physician could not access your medical records.</p>
<p>Threats to availability include loss of processing ability due to natural disasters; hardware failures; programming errors; human errors; injury, sickness, or death of key personnel; distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; and malicious code. We are more vulnerable to availability threats than to the other components of the CIA triad. We are certain to face some of them. Safeguards that address availability include access controls, monitoring, data redundancy, resilient systems, virtualization, server clustering, environmental controls, <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/services/cybersecurity-consulting-advisory-services/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-planning">continuity of operations planning</a>, and <a href="https://www.tylercybersecurity.com/services/cyber-incident-response-exercise">incident response preparedness</a>.</p>

    <section>
      
      

      <p><span>What tradition is there in the startup world more timeless than dunking on VCs? Whether it’s the infamous </span><a href="https://twitter.com/VCBrags"><span>@VCbrags</span></a><span> Twitter account or startup founders themselves mocking the industry, there’s no shortage of hot takes on there around venture capital.</span></p>
<p><span>But if you’re a fledgling founder yourself, or work daily with these sorts of people, you may reasonably be wary of blasting a major VC on your Linkedin or Twitter page. After all - you </span><i><span>do</span></i><span> need their money to survive, right?</span></p>
<p><span>That’s where </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/"><span>VC Guide</span></a><span> comes in. This site allows founders to submit anonymous reviews about their experiences with certain investors from certain firms, assigning them a rating on a scale of 1-10 and writing a description about their experience. Though VCs are encouraged to respond to these claims, they seldom do. While the reviews on the site tend to skew positive - this is, after all, supposed to be more of a tool for startups than a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXH837nljtI&amp;ab_channel=WonderWanny"><span>VC Burn Book</span></a><span> - there are still a number of overwhelmingly negative reviews and VCs who have apparently built up quite an infamous reputation for themselves.</span></p>
<p>For your reading pleasure, we’ve scraped the site’s reviews and data to create a list of the worst-rated VCs on the platform. Let’s briefly explain how the metrics work.</p>
<p><span>For each VC, we’ve listed three metrics: Average Score, Sentiment, and Review Count. The first and last ones are self-explanatory - Average Score is an average of all the reviews any given VC has. Sentiment, however, is a little more complicated. Our sentiment rating uses a tool for Python called </span><a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/simplifying-social-media-sentiment-analysis-using-vader-in-python-f9e6ec6fc52f"><span>VADER</span></a><span> to quantify how the language in any given review skews. In short, it analyzes the language used in all the reviews for a VC and gives them a score ranging from -1 (overwhelmingly negative) to 1 (overwhelmingly positive).</span></p>
<p><span>Also worth noting is that our data is up to date as of September 17, meaning that any reviews added or removed since then are not reflected in our table or in our scores. This is why you may see a review count lower or higher than what VC Guide currently displays. We have also excluded any VCs with only one review in order to get a more complete sample. You can access our aggregated data <a href="https://www.kgbase.com/data/stellaweng/vc-reviews-aggregated/ctx-MI0ldc5nj9aAevk-v04/tables/tab-MI0ldcAHmgQOh7a9Se9?ui%5Bp%5D=0&amp;ui%5Bsc%5D%5Bcol%5D=col-1&amp;ui%5Bsc%5D%5Bdir%5D=asc">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>With all that out of the way, let’s find out who the worst of the worst are.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>1. <strong>Erik Torenberg</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" height="347" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/erik_list_edit.png/erik_list_edit-700x347.png" width="700"><span></span></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Firm:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.villageglobal.vc/portfolio/">Village Global</a></strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Avg Score: </strong>2/10</h4>
<h4><strong>Sentiment: </strong>0.30</h4>
<h4><strong>Review Count:&nbsp;</strong>6</h4>

<p><span>Ringing in solidly as a definitive “worst” VC on the site is Village Global co-founder Erik Torenberg, who has managed to rack up five reviews with a score of 1/10 or 3/10, and only one positive one. Torenberg’s reviews characterize him as all show and no substance, and criticize him for caring a little too much about his Twitter following.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span>After any reasonable conversation, you can tell he’s just full of regurgitated bullshit he read on Twitter,” one </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/reczDscEjoUkcaprd"><span>particularly scathing</span></a><span> review reads. “Many folks have imposter syndrome, he really is an imposter. Should be an “influencer” rather than a VC, I think deep down that’s what he really wants.”</span></p>
<p>“Erik cares much more about his Twitter following than his companies,” reads another. “I feel like if an investor has time to tweet so much instead of you know...working with his portfolio companies that's pretty much always a sign that they're in it just for social status.”</p>
<p>The one positive review in Torenberg’s favor, a 10/10 sticks out like a suspiciously sore thumb. In contrast to the others, it paints him as a much more proactive and valuable investor than any other review. The anonymous poster claims to have received funding from Village Global, and states that Torenberg has been there day and night to help out.</p>
<p><span>If we’re to draw any conclusion from this group of reviews, it’s that Torenberg is perhaps a good name to have backing your business, but will provide little value. He’ll definitely </span><a href="https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><span>tweet about you</span></a><span> a lot, though.</span></p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;Ursheet Parikh</h2>
<p><img alt="" height="406" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/ursheet_parikh.jpg/ursheet_parikh-700x406.jpg" width="700"><span></span></p>
<h4><strong>Firm:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayfield.com/companies/">Mayfield</a></strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Avg Score:</strong>&nbsp;2<b>/10</b></h4>
<h4><strong>Sentiment:&nbsp;</strong>-0.92</h4>
<h4><strong>Review Count:&nbsp;</strong>2</h4>

<p><span>Wow. That is a </span><i><span>low</span></i><span> sentiment score. With only two reviews, Mayfield’s Ursheet Parikh manages to rack up the absolute lowest sentiment rating on the entire site. Both reviews share similar complaints as well.</span></p>
<p><span>“Smart guy but incredibly rude,” </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/recgrMqR6Lx6xIyju"><span>one review</span></a><span> reads. “Cut me off 10 minutes into my pitch and told me all the reasons we were going to fail.” Somehow, this short but scathing review ranked Parikh at a 3/10. Maybe those were 10 very valuable minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/recNLjeHUiypV2YPU"><span>other review</span></a><span> says they got even </span><i><span>less</span></i><span> time. “</span><span>Worst pitch I've ever had. Rudely cut us off about 5 minutes in and spent the rest of the hour lecturing us about how our product would never work, our technology wasn't any better than what existed and that the incumbents were going to crush us out of existence.”</span></p>
<p>If you’re going to meet with Parikh, take these reviews as a warning to get your pitch under 5 minutes. Maybe practice it in an elevator.</p>

<p><span>Backend Capital and Y Combinator founder Lucy Guo finds herself at number three on our list. We’d link to their portfolio, but it’s not available on their site at the moment. Apparently they’re getting so much interest, they’ve replaced their entire site with a simple </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemmcRuSizlHeWDMqnDhykKchPbicEEHMzIS1668yHieLikgA/viewform"><span>Google Form</span></a><span>. Like Torenberg, Guo has some strong negative reviews and one glowing one. Let's start with the bad.</span></p>
<p><span>“Lucy pulled Backend’s investment, then invested in our direct competitor a few days later,” Says the </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/rec9LJ1fXL65qyuhZ"><span>lowest-rated</span></a><span> review. “</span><span>She has some great ideas... but if you're looking for a trustworthy business partner, keep pitching.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Entitled and arrogant,” </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/imported-item-140"><span>reads another</span></a><span>. “Gets up and leaves if she’s not interested.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still, Guo is well-connected with links to Y Combinator, which is appealing to almost any startup. It seems to have worked out well for at least one reviewer, who gave Guo </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/recVZZsAICivEdxVD"><span>a 10</span></a><span> and wrote, “[Lucy is] super energetic and passionate about helping her portfolio companies with their pitch, deck, etc. She's also very well connected and her name alone got a few firms to close our Seed round.”</span></p>

<h4><strong>Review Count: </strong>4</h4>

<p>Sequoia Capital’s Alfred Lin is next up on our list at number four. While Lin’s overall score is negative, it seems to be for a wide range of reasons, unlike for our previous three VCs. These reviews claim that Lin is either arrogant, unmotivated, or just didn’t get the pitch.</p>
<p><span>“</span><span>Alfred was very underwhelming,” one reviewer wrote. “Asked a bunch of dumb questions, didn't understand the business, didn't take the time to get context to understand the business, and just generally felt like he didn't give a shit.” Apparently all this was enough to give Lin a 5/10.</span></p>
<p>Hilariously, one writer expressed legitimate concern for Lin’s wellbeing. “I want to send Alfred on an Eat Pray Love journey to rediscover himself as a VC because he just seems bored/jaded. I almost felt bad for him because he seems so over it. "It" being investing in startups and meeting founders who are putting everything out there and giving their all.”&nbsp;Despite the concerned rhetoric, this&nbsp;reviewer gave Lin a 2/10. Cold.</p>

<h2>5. Brianne Kimmel</h2>

<h4><strong>Sentiment:&nbsp;</strong>-0.38</h4>
<h4><strong>Review Count:&nbsp;</strong>2</h4>

<p>Kimmel's previous reviews have been deleted and new ones have come in since we scraped VC Guide earlier this month, but overall Kimmel’s reputation seems to be that she's someone with a useful name, but not who you want to lean on in a time of need. Her two new reviews are middle-of-the-road and paint her as pleasant to work with,&nbsp; but extremely flaky and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Her&nbsp;now-deleted reviews, however,&nbsp;are not nearly as glowing.&nbsp;<span>“</span><span>Very loud on Twitter, but have heard that she’s all-talk/no-substance," one reads. "Has a bad reputation for being unavailable/under-delivering as an investor from her founders. But her brand name might mean something in the enterprise world.” This one may have been deleted as it hints that the writer did not work directly with Kimmel, but it speaks to her reputation nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span>At best, it seems like Kimmel can be an enthusiastic VC who takes on <a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/recqLarzhGpK97IZp">too many projects</a> at once. "When she engages it can be tremendous, but when she flakes on a meeting or doesn't follow up on a commitment it's frustrating. If I was her I would cool it with new deals and focus on NPS of current portfolio," wrote one reviewer who gave her a 6/10 rating.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Review Count:&nbsp;</strong>4</h4>

<p><span>Shrug Capital founder Niv Dror finds himself on the better side of this worst VC list, but that’s still not much of an accomplishment. The reviewers seem to have largely had a bad time with Dror, who appears to come to meetings rather unprepared and unenthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span>Clearly was unprepared for the first meeting - didn't review any of the slides or other materials sent ahead of time,” </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/rec3Nn2z2A40Ab1Se"><span>one review</span></a><span> reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Quite unprofessional, quite useless; Niv appears to want to look like a VC while not doing much in reality,” reads </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/recEZC0wVPnwilpoz"><span>another scathing</span></a><span> one.</span></p>
<p><span>Dror’s relatively young firm aggressively brands itself. It’s website shows a feed of people with the firm’s stickers, which read VALUEADD - apparently the firm’s logo. </span><a href="http://vcguide.co/reviews/recQhO0mJAn1mpVGD"><span>One reviewer</span></a><span> had some choice words for those stickers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“Niv treated me like he was better than me from the moment we met. He ended up writing a check and only ever reached out to criticize. When I was hoping to get insight from "mr value add" he would never respond. Ever.”</p>

<p><span>Our data from earlier in the month places Fushman at a solid seven on our list, but recent reviews have bumped him score up to a more middling 5.42.

<p><span>“</span><span>Very flaky and snakey as an investor,” the </span><a href="https://www.vcguide.co/reviews/imported-item-67"><span>lowest-scored</span></a><span> review reads. “Awful.” Nice.</span></p>

<p>You may be wondering who we are and why we wrote this book.</p>
<p>At the end of Harry’s last book,
<a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/"><em>Test-Driven Development with Python</em></a> (O’Reilly),
he found himself asking a bunch of questions about architecture, such as,
What’s the best way of structuring your application so that it’s easy to test?
More specifically, so that your core business logic is covered by unit tests,
and so that you minimize the number of integration and end-to-end tests you need?
He made vague references to "Hexagonal Architecture" and "Ports and Adapters"
and "Functional Core, Imperative Shell," but if he was honest, he’d have to
admit that these weren’t things he really understood or had done in practice.</p>
<p>And then he was lucky enough to run into Bob, who has the answers to all these
questions.</p>
<p>Bob ended up as a software architect because nobody else on his team was
doing it. He turned out to be pretty bad at it, but <em>he</em> was lucky enough to run
into Ian Cooper, who taught him new ways of writing and thinking about code.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_managing_complexity_solving_business_problems"><a href="#_managing_complexity_solving_business_problems"></a>Managing Complexity, Solving Business Problems</h3>
<p>We both work for MADE.com, a European ecommerce company that sells furniture
online; there, we apply the techniques in this book to build distributed systems
that model real-world business problems. Our example domain is the first system
Bob built for MADE, and this book is an attempt to write down all the <em>stuff</em> we
have to teach new programmers when they join one of our teams.</p>
<p>MADE.com operates a global supply chain of freight partners and manufacturers.
To keep costs low, we try to optimize the delivery of stock to our
warehouses so that we don’t have unsold goods lying around the place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the sofa that you want to buy will arrive in port on the very day
that you decide to buy it, and we’ll ship it straight to your house without
ever storing it. <span>Getting</span> the timing right is a tricky balancing act when goods take
three months to arrive by container ship. Along the way, things get broken or water
damaged, storms cause unexpected delays, logistics partners mishandle goods,
paperwork goes missing, customers change their minds and amend their orders,
and so on.</p>
<p>We solve those problems by building intelligent software representing the
kinds of operations taking place in the real world so that we can automate as
much of the business as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_why_python"><a href="#_why_python"></a>Why Python?</h3>
<p>If you’re reading this book, we probably don’t need to convince you that Python
is great, so the real question is "Why does the <em>Python</em> community need a book
like this?" The answer is about Python’s popularity and maturity: although Python is
probably the world’s fastest-growing programming language and is nearing the top
of the absolute popularity tables, it’s only just starting to take on the kinds
of problems that the C# and Java world has been working on for years.
Startups become real businesses; web apps and scripted automations are becoming
(whisper it) <em>enterprise</em> <span><em>software</em></span>.</p>
<p>In the Python world, we often quote the Zen of Python:
"There should be one—​and preferably only one—​obvious way to do it."<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
Unfortunately, as project size grows, the most obvious way of doing things
isn’t always the way that helps you manage complexity and evolving
requirements.</p>
<p>None of the techniques and patterns we discuss in this book are
new, but they are mostly new to the Python world. And this book isn’t
a replacement for the classics in the field such as Eric Evans’s
<em>Domain-Driven Design</em>
or Martin Fowler’s <em>Patterns of
Enterprise Application Architecture</em> (both published by Addison-Wesley <span>Professional</span>)—which we often refer to and
encourage you to go and read.</p>
<p>But all the classic code examples in the literature do tend to be written in
Java or <span>C++/#</span>, and if you’re a Python person and haven’t used either of
those languages in a long time (or indeed ever), those code listings can be
quite…​trying. There’s a reason the latest edition of that other classic text, Fowler’s
<em>Refactoring</em> (Addison-Wesley Professional), is in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_tdd_ddd_and_event_driven_architecture"><a href="#_tdd_ddd_and_event_driven_architecture"></a>TDD, DDD, and Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
<p>In order of notoriety, we know of three tools for managing complexity:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Test-driven development</em> (TDD) helps us to build code that is correct
and enables us to refactor or add new features, without fear of regression.
But it can be hard to get the best out of our tests: How do we make sure
that they run as fast as possible? That we get as much coverage and feedback
from fast, dependency-free unit tests and have the minimum number of slower,
flaky end-to-end tests?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Domain-driven design</em> (DDD) asks us to focus our efforts on building a good
model of the business domain, but how do we make sure that our models aren’t
encumbered with infrastructure concerns and don’t become hard to change?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loosely coupled (micro)services integrated via messages (sometimes called
<em>reactive microservices</em>) are a well-established answer to managing complexity
across multiple applications or business domains. But it’s not always
obvious how to make them fit with the established tools of
the Python world—​Flask, Django, Celery, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
Don’t be put off if you’re not working with (or interested in) microservices.  The vast majority of the patterns we discuss, including much of the event-driven architecture material, is absolutely applicable in a monolithic architecture.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Our aim with this book is to introduce several classic architectural patterns
and show how they support TDD, DDD, and event-driven services.  We hope
it will serve as a reference for implementing them in a Pythonic way, and that
people can use it as a first step toward further research  in this field.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_who_should_read_this_book"><a href="#_who_should_read_this_book"></a>Who Should Read This Book</h3>
<p>Here are a few things we assume about you, dear reader:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’ve been close to some reasonably complex Python applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ve seen some of the pain that comes with trying to manage
that complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t necessarily know anything about DDD or any of the
classic application architecture patterns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We structure our explorations of architectural patterns around an example app,
building it up chapter by chapter. We use TDD at
work, so we tend to show listings of tests first, followed by implementation.
If you’re not used to working test-first, it may feel a little strange at
the beginning, but we hope you’ll soon get used to seeing code "being used"
(i.e., from the outside) before you see how it’s built on the inside.</p>
<p>We use some specific Python frameworks and technologies, including Flask,
SQLAlchemy, and pytest, as well as Docker and Redis. If you’re already
familiar with them, that won’t hurt, but we don’t think it’s required.  One of
our main aims with this book is to build an architecture for which specific
technology choices become minor implementation details.</p>

<h3 id="_a_brief_overview_of_what_youll_learn"><a href="#_a_brief_overview_of_what_youll_learn"></a>A Brief Overview of What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>The book is divided into two parts; here’s a look at the topics we’ll cover
and the chapters they live in.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_part1"><a href="#_part1"></a><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/part1.html">#part1</a></h4>

<dd>
<p>At some level, everyone has learned the lesson that complex business
problems need to be reflected in code, in the form of a model of the domain.
But why does it always seem to be so hard to do without getting tangled
up with infrastructure concerns, our web frameworks, or whatever else?
In the first chapter we give a broad overview of <em>domain modeling</em> and DDD, and we
show how to get started with a model that has no external dependencies, and
fast unit tests. Later we return to DDD patterns to discuss how to choose
the right aggregate, and how this choice relates to questions of data
integrity.</p>

<dt>Repository, Service Layer, and Unit of Work patterns (Chapters <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_02_repository.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_04_service_layer.html">4</a>, and <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_05_high_gear_low_gear.html">5</a>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In these three chapters we present three closely related and
mutually reinforcing patterns that support our ambition to keep
the model free of extraneous dependencies.  We build a layer of
abstraction around persistent storage, and we build a service
layer to define the entrypoints to our system and capture the
primary use cases. We show how this layer makes it easy to build
thin entrypoints to our system, whether it’s a Flask API or a CLI.</p>

<dd>
<p>After presenting the first abstraction (the Repository pattern), we take the
opportunity for a general discussion of how to choose abstractions, and
what their role is in choosing how our software is coupled together. After
we introduce the Service Layer pattern, we talk a bit about achieving a <em>test pyramid</em>
and writing unit tests at the highest possible level of abstraction.</p>

<dd>
<p>We introduce three more mutually reinforcing patterns: the Domain Events, Message Bus, and Handler patterns. <em>Domain events</em> are a vehicle for capturing the idea that some
interactions with a system are triggers for others. We use  a <em>message
bus</em> to allow actions to trigger events and call appropriate <em>handlers</em>.
We move on to discuss how events can be used as a pattern for integration
between services in a microservices architecture. Finally, we distinguish between <em>commands</em> and <em>events</em>. Our application is now
fundamentally a message-processing system.</p>

<p>Implementing architectural patterns always looks easy when you show a simple

<p>Recently, a colleague spent a bunch of time working on a bug. When
attempting to perform some action, the system would provide feedback
that everything was going as planned, and then "go dark," seemingly
out of no where. It's important to realize that this is a complex
distributed system, and that there is a network connection between the
"part that worked" and "the part that went dark." But, there wasn't a
change to the connection logic, and it worked before, so that
"couldn't possibly be it." <em>(Yes. I already told you where this is going—Ed)</em></p>

<p>Suppose you're writing a Go program and you want to perform a different
action based on the value of another value. You might do this:</p>

<pre><code>func Greeter(lang, name string) {
    switch lang {
    case "english":
        fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
    case "spanish":
        fmt.Printf("Hola, %s!\n", name)
    default:
        fmt.Printf("excuse me?\n")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Based on <code>lang</code>, the function will (naively) print to the screen a
greeting, for <code>name</code>, in the specified language. </p>

<pre><code>Greeter("spanish", "Andrew")  // outputs: Hola, Andrew!
Greeter("english", "Andrew") // outputs: Hello, Andrew!
</code></pre>

<p><em>(Now, you can argue with me about whether strings are appropriate here, when an <code>iota</code> would do, but that would be silly, as that's not the point. In the bug, strings were used, so that's what we're going to use here.—Ed)</em></p>

<p>In the case of <code>Greeter</code>, there's no dependency between <code>lang</code>
and <code>name</code>. <code>name</code> is perfectly valid for each <code>lang</code>, unless you're
fancy and do a translation of "Andrew" to "Andres". Again, not the point.</p>

<p>In a more complicated setting there <em>is</em> a dependency between the two
values. Let's take a look at a Go API many of us are familiar with
because it's front and center on the package documentation for
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/">net</a>.</p>

<pre><code>conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "golang.org:80")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates something beautiful; flexibility! If I want to
<code>Dial</code> a <code>unix</code> socket, the right parameters are <code>"unix",
"/path/to/socket"</code>, and <code>hostname:port</code> is meaningless. This works
because <code>Dial</code> implements validation logic to ensure that the
address provided makes sense for the protocol, and returns an error if
not. This is helpful in reducing the amount of code required to
dynamically <code>Dial</code> a socket specified from external configuration, but
it pushes error checking to <em>runtime</em> which is an aphorism for "you're
eventually going to be woken up due to this bug."</p>

<p>If we redesign the API, we can get the compiler to ensure we're
not doing something silly; but we need to make a few concessions.</p>

<p><code>DialUnix(addr UnixSocket)</code> could ensure that <code>addr</code> is a path to a
unix socket. It may <em>not</em> delegate everything to the compiler, but
obvious errors could be detected. You wouldn't be able to, say,
<code>DialUnix(HostPort("golang.org", 80))</code> since <code>HostPort</code> is not of type
<code>UnixSocket</code>. This particular example works better if file paths
aren't represented as strings, a <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">sore point of
sorts</a>. Then,
<code>UnixSocket</code> can be an effective alias to <code>Path</code>, for instance.</p>

<p>But what is the cost here? Well, in the case of <code>Dial</code>, the interface
that the <code>net</code> package exposes becomes much larger, creating more
cognitive overhead for programmers, and <code>net</code> developers. Go <code>net</code> developers
have to create a new function, and type for every new type of supported
socket. Programmerss must adopt those new functions, increase the things
they know about, and no one is truly happy with the experience.</p>

<p>Go doesn't provide an obvious mechanism to make this more generic, and
while the generics proposal <em>may make solving this possible</em> that's not
going to help us for quite some time.</p>

<p>So what is a programmer to do?</p>

<p>To recap the problem here: when using strings as arguments to simplify
an interface, the compiler cannot create assurances that the two
strings relate to each other in any meaningful way, which means that
all validation must be done at runtime, which almost certainly means
bugs are gonna slip into production, despite the fact that we already
pay for static types in the language, and the compiler.</p>

<p>The other possibility, which keeps a singular function, is to have
<code>Dial</code> and an interface instead, say, <code>ProtoAddr</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// SIDENOTE: This, effectively, already exists as net.Addr ... :tableflip:
type ProtoAddr interface {
    Protocol() string // wait, wuh????
    Addr() string
}

func Dial(pa ProtoAddr) (net.Conn, err) {
    return originalDial(pa.Protocol(), pa.Addr())
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can then create helper functions and types that <em>constrain</em> our
inputs and allow for more assurances that the caller isn't doing
something silly, like providing a filesystem path instead of an IP
address. Want to <code>Dial</code> an IP address?
<code>Dial(TCPIPv4Addr{net.IPv4{127,0,0,1}, 8000})</code>. </p>

<p>Similar types can just as easily be constructed for <code>hostname:port</code> addresses,
Unix Sockets, etc. The important aspect here is that the caller's intentions
are stated, in a way that the compiler can catch, and that the library
author can quickly assert validity of.</p>

<pre><code>type TCPIPv4Addr struct {
    IP IPv4
    Port uint16
}

func (t TCPIPv4Addr) Protocol() string { return "tcp" }
func (t TCPIPV4Addr Addr() string { return fmt.Sprint("%s:%d", t.IP.String(), t.Port) }

func NewTCPIPv4Addr(ip IPv4, port uint16) TCPIPv4Addr ...

type UnixAddr struct {
    Socket filesystem.Path // made up, because, in Go, strings are totally fine for everything, including file paths.
}

func (u UnixAddr) Protocol() string { return "unix" }
func (u UnixAddr) Addr() string { return u.Socket.String() }

</code></pre>

<p>In the above code snippets, you'll notice something odd--that
<code>string</code>'s are ultimately passed into
<code>originalDial</code> as before. This is meant to address and illustrate how you might
take <code>Dial</code> and evolve it, just as you might evolve instances in your
own codebase. This whole idea, of course, fundamentally is not backward compatible.</p>

<p><em>"But wait a minute, Andrew! What the hell? All you've done is add more boilerplate for me to type out, and I already have enough of that with Go's error checking. What's this got to do with me? Why is this any better?"</em>, you say.</p>

<p>The primary job of a program is to take input and produce some output.
This is vague; yes. The primary job of a programmer is to ensure that
the input given to a program makes sense in order to produce the
desired output.</p>

<p>In other words, the fact that we build APIs that take arbitrary
strings, like <code>Dial</code>, doesn't give us a pass from validating that the
input makes sense, and indeed <code>Dial</code> heavily validates input. But, why
not leverage the type system to check as much of your work as
possible at compile time?</p>

<p>Go's type system doesn't provide us with enough expressive power to solve
this simply, unfortunately. And so, as written, it's not possible to 
prevent a silly programmer from calling the new <code>Dial</code> with a <code>LOLAddr</code>
defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>type LOLAddr struct { 
   What string
   Lol string
}

func (l LOLAddr) Protocol() string { return l.What }
func (l LOLAddr) Addr() string { return l.Lol }

Dial(LOLAddr{"unix", "localhost:8383"})
</code></pre>

<p>Because of this, you might think that the implementation I've described
is totally useless; I don't think so. Go <em>does</em> provide a mechanism
that you can use which gives you all of the good properties of what I
described without the bad. </p>

<pre><code>type ClosedProtoAddr interface {
    Protocol() string
    Addr() string
    closed() struct{}
}
</code></pre>

<p>This interface is impossible to implement outside of the package it's
defined in, because <code>closed() struct{}</code> is not exported. Using this,
we can <em>constrain</em> the input to known good values, and exhaustively
create all of the supported <code>Dial</code> compatible <code>ProtoAddr</code>s in the
package. <code>Dial</code> just has to handle the possibility that <code>nil</code> was
passed in, and validate that nothing sneaky is hiding in one of those
strings, something that is done right now in the old interface, too.</p>

<hr>

<p>So about that bug? Well, it was especially sinister as it was
contained in a subsystem that implements a proxy with a virtual
network address overlay. The proxy's connection is <em>always</em> supposed
to be alive and so it reconnects in a loop, without providing much in
the way of visibility in regards to its status. There's no timeout
errors. There's no error logs. There's an assumption made that if the
link goes down, a retry will eventually succeed. </p>

<p>There are, also, two virtual address types. The two types of addresses are there to allow you to say "connect to this
specific node" or "connect to <em>any</em> of the nodes in this
cluster". These are reasonable things. The addresses <em>look</em>
different, but are each represented by strings. The address type,
itself, is represented by strings.  There is no
<code>DialRandomNodeInCluster(clusterId)</code>. There is no
<code>DialHost(hostId)</code>. There is an analog to <code>Dial(type, addr)</code>,
and then a <em>lot</em> of screaming when you realize that the feature you
are working on required you to dial a specific host—<em>not a random one</em>—and 
you didn't change the first argument that provides the context for how to interpret the address.</p>

<p>As developers, it is important to create clear guidance on how not to
be frustrated when attempting to use our libraries. This, too often,
is delegated to poorly written documentation, even when the best
documentation, the code, can be used to point out our misuse, by 
our friend the type checker.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many people want to become influencers, but they don’t realize the responsibility that comes with influence</p><cite>Unknown</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Contents</strong>:</p>



<p>1.) Introduction</p>



<p>2.) Backstory</p>



<p>3.) That Escalated Quickly</p>



<p>4.) In Closing / Lessons Learned</p>







<p><strong>1.) Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Social media can be hazardous if you are not careful, and I’m not talking about its addictive potential or the proclaimed effects on dopamine. I’m talking about real, physical threats that can occur.</p>



<p>I am originally from Sudan, where war, death, and religious extremism are common.</p>



<p>Let me tell you a story.</p>



<p><strong>2.) Backstory</strong></p>



<p>Back when I finished high school, I had like a six month holiday before going to college and had a lot of free time; during that time, I joined multiple local Facebook groups (100k+ Active Members).</p>



<p>These groups were rife with conversations about the refugee crisis in the country, how refugees are taking over the fast-food industry, opening restaurants, competing with local restaurants, and taking them out of business.</p>



<p>I would occasionally get into arguments with various members about discrimination, how refugees from war-torn countries should be granted fundamental rights, treated as equals, etc.</p>



<p>Then one day, this happened.</p>



<p><strong>3.) That Escalated Quickly</strong></p>



<p>I vividly recall waking up that day to a text message on WhatsApp, and keep in mind that I got this message on a personal private number that I didn’t share anywhere. I had less than 50 contacts on my phone, mostly friends and family.</p>



<p>Anyway. The sender had a very frightening profile picture, he or they created the WhatsApp profile two hours before sending the message, and he was using a Philippinen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoIP</a> phone number that I’ve never seen before.</p>



<p>His message reads:</p>



<p>“Asalam Alaikum wa Rahmat Allah wa barakatu, ya Ibrahim.”<br>“We are from the Islamic State of Iraq and the levant. We have been following you lately, and you seem to possess character traits that make you a good fit for us.”</p>



<p>I replied:</p>



<p>“Wa Alaikum al-salam, your ideology isn’t the same as mine, and I have no interest in going anywhere with you.”</p>



<p>Shit got real when they replied:</p>



<p>“Ok. Don’t do anything stupid, or we will pay you a visit at [my_home_address] and take you against your will. You will thank us later for guiding you on the right path. We know that you went to [my_high_school] and applied to go to [my_current_college].</p>



<p>Don’t do anything stupid, or the consequences will be dire.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="603" height="315" src="https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/that-escalated-quickly.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/that-escalated-quickly.jpg 603w, https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/that-escalated-quickly-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></figure>



<p>This message was enough to trigger a panic attack of ungodly proportions; I knew at this point that this isn’t one of my friends trolling me.</p>



<p>I went to the Security and Intelligence Service and reported the incident, and provided the chat logs and any information I had on them.</p>



<p>They calmed me down and said that they would deal with it effectively.</p>



<p>But, even when I went back home, they kept sending messages with all my other social media accounts links, almost any picture or selfie I had uploaded online (I was obsessed with Instagram back then), and a lot of additional personal identifying information; they also knew the names of various family members.</p>



<p>I sat there for hours and hours, thinking about how to put an end to this nightmare.</p>



<p>Then I came up with an idea, but this idea had a huge probability of failure, and if it failed, then maybe I’ll face what they called ‘dire consequences.’</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="287" src="https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/L.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/L.jpg 347w, https://www.ibrascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/L-300x248.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></figure>



<p>Eventually, I pulled the trigger. I made a phishing link that redirects to my Facebook account and sent them a message like this:</p>



<p>“OMG!!! DID YOU FIND MY PERSONAL INFORMATION HERE: [phishing link]!”</p>



<p>Luckily enough, they took the bait; after that, I didn’t reply to any further messages.</p>



<p>I sent an email to the Security and Intelligence Service with the IP address and location coordinates of the people behind this.</p>



<p>Bizarrely enough, the senders were operating from my exact city, and even though they used a VoIP number, they didn’t disguise their IP in any way.</p>



<p>After two or three days, I got a call from the Security and Intelligence Service asking about how I got the senders’ information. I cooperated and told them everything.</p>



<p>And no, I didn’t face any ‘dire consequences’ up until this day.</p>



<p><strong>4.) In Closing / Lessons Learned</strong></p>



<p>Many people want to become influencers, but they don’t realize the responsibility and danger of influence. When you share your opinions on social media, especially with topics such as politics and religion, expect anything to happen because you may tip off the wrong people.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>How hard should I push myself?</p><p>Itâ€™s a question I ask myself a lot, and I bet you do too. On the one hand I really want to push myself. Iâ€™m ambitious, I want to leave it all out on the fieldâ€”some of my peak work moments have come from times when Iâ€™ve pushed myself to a place where I didnâ€™t think I could go. We all have more ability to adapt to stress and pressure than we think we do.ï»¿</p><p>On the other hand, I want to be kind to myself. I wonder how much the drive to push myself is really just a drive to make up for something that I feel is missing or inadequateâ€”and whether pushing myself will actually fill the hole. I also sometimes wonder whether letting myself off the hook is just laziness masquerading as self-care. Itâ€™s hard to tell.</p><p>But importantly, I wonder whether pushing myself might, in fact, kill me. Constant pressure creates chronic stress, and thereâ€™s all sorts of scientific studies that show that chronic stress is really bad for you. It makes you more susceptible to heart disease, it makes it harder to recover from illnesses, it can affect your sleep, and it can even affect your working memory.</p><p>Thereâ€™s also all sorts of literature (and conversations on Twitter) that says that stress is actually good for you.&nbsp;</p><p>What gives? How much stress is good, and how much is bad?&nbsp;</p><p>I think that in order to understand the question we posed at the topâ€”how much we should be pushing ourselvesâ€”we have to better understand stress. We need to understand what the stress of pushing ourselves does to our bodies, how much we can take of it, and how we can, hopefully, learn to cope with it better.</p><p>Thatâ€™s what&nbsp;<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers</a>&nbsp;by Robert M. Sapolsky is about. Robert's a stress researcher, and as far as I can tell he's one of the good ones. He's the kind of intellectual who's smart, but also smart enough to know what he doesn't know. He's written a <span id="quill-collection-1611655017162" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;book&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Books&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;17&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/books&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/books">book</a></span>, but he doesn't come across as trying to sell it to youâ€”he's kind of like your zany self-aware smart-as-hell uncle who happens to study the stress responses of baboons for a living.</p><p>In the book Dr. Sapolsky harnesses his own research, as well as a wide array of animal and human studies to figure out the answer to a fairly simple question: how does stress work, and why do humans get stress-related diseases?&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s an interesting questionâ€”you can understand why a human body might react poorly to not being fed enough. But why would psychological stress have dangerous consequences? The basic gist is this:&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response is built to get us out of danger. If you're an animal in the Serengeti and you're being chased by a lion you really, really want to have a stress response. Being stressed means youâ€™re preparing your muscles to moveâ€”a lot. Your heart rate rises and pushes blood to your extremities. Glucose is released into your bloodstream to help run your muscles as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response pushes certain parts of your body into high gearâ€”but it also turns certain parts of your body off. For example, when youâ€™re stressed digestion is inhibited. Whatâ€™s the point of wasting energy on digesting food for later when you might not even survive for 10 more minutes? Reproduction is also inhibited. Same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all well and good in the wildâ€”you don't need to reproduce if a lion is eating your face off. But humans, and some more intelligent animals, have evolved the stress response from an unqualified Good Thing into...well, something that might kill you.</p><p>Whatâ€™s different about our stress response? Well, we have the ability to&nbsp;<em>anticipate</em>danger. Other animals have this ability too: itâ€™s a good thing to get stressed seeing the lion all the way across the savannah, instead of only when it mauls your intestines out. But humans have evolved this anticipation ability to extend far beyond other animals. We anticipate bad things months, years, or even decades out. And when we do this, the very same stress response gets turned onâ€”even though there is no immediate danger, and there is no immediate way to avoid it.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, you arenâ€™t just activating the stress response for a few minutes when youâ€™re running for your life. Instead, itâ€™s activated all the timeâ€”chronically. And this is where the problems start.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember we mentioned earlier that the stress response amps some parts of your body into high gear, and turns off others? If youâ€™re doing that chronically, you start to have problems. Suddenly, your digestive system isnâ€™t just inhibited for a few minutes while youâ€™re escaping danger. Itâ€™s chronically inhibited. The same thing happens with your immune systemâ€”chronic stress tamps it down, and makes it harder for you to fight off diseases. Stress is bad for your heart tooâ€”if youâ€™re pumping blood as if you need to run from something all the time, youâ€™re going to get high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, according to Sapolsky, â€œthe stress response can become more dangerous than the stressor itself, especially when the stress is purely psychological.â€�</p><p>To be clear, stress doesnâ€™t actually make you sick. But it does leave you more vulnerable to disease and illnesses than you otherwise would beâ€”and those&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;make you very sick.</p><h3><strong>So is stress bad?</strong></h3><p>Stress isnâ€™t good or bad. Itâ€™s a tool. In small doses itâ€™s good, but too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing pretty quickly.</p><p>When your stress response is working properly it makes you run faster, your memory gets better, youâ€™re able to focus better. But when your stress response is over-activated, or chronically activatedâ€”you get ulcers and heart disease. Itâ€™s bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A good analogy is exercise. Too little exercise and you open yourself up to a whole host of diseases, both physical and psychological. Too much, and you can actually kill yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What do we do about it?</strong></h3><p>The answer to the question we posed at the top, then, is that itâ€™s great to push yourselfâ€”but you should be paying attention to the signs that tell you that you need a break. And itâ€™s to give yourself plenty of ways to manage stress while youâ€™re going through it, so that it doesnâ€™t affect you as badly as it could.</p><p>This is the really interesting nugget: stress isnâ€™t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies. Which means if you want to live a life where youâ€™re pushing yourself, itâ€™s best to develop a variety of coping strategies to help you manage it.&nbsp;</p><p>Hereâ€™s what Sapolsky recommends:</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of control.&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>If you put a human in a room where loud noises are going off, youâ€™ll activate their stress response. If you give the human a button to reduce the volume of the loud noises theyâ€™ll be less stressedâ€”regardless of whether they even use the button.&nbsp;</p><p>What that means is, just knowing you have the&nbsp;<em>option</em>&nbsp;to reduce stress is enough to make something less stressfulâ€”even if youâ€™re not actually controlling the stressors at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Itâ€™s why the first few sessions of therapy are often so powerful for patients. Youâ€™ve finally found a way to manage how youâ€™re feeling, even though you probably havenâ€™t changed too much about your life.</p><p>When youâ€™re facing mild to moderate stressors, ask yourself,&nbsp;<em>How can I increase my sense of control in this situation?</em>&nbsp;You might find there are simple answers that will make you feel a lot better.</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of predictability.</strong></h4><p>Rats that are exposed to repeated electric shocks are more likely to get ulcers. But if you ring a bell before you administer the shockâ€”making the shock more predictableâ€”the rats are less likely to get ulcers. If you make the stressor predictable, you only have to get stressed right before it happens. That means youâ€™re not stressed the rest of the time, and therefore the stress response doesnâ€™t wreak as much havoc on your body.</p><p>Making the stressors in your life more predictable can have a similar effect. When you see CEOs that keep their calendars clear and never do phone callsâ€”youâ€™re seeing the benefit of predictability in action.</p><p>Of course, we canâ€™t make our lives totally predictable (and in fact that wouldnâ€™t be desirable.) But the more you can expose yourself to stressors in a predictable way the better off youâ€™ll be. For example, maybe only doomscroll on Twitter once a week. Or only check email a couple of times a day.</p><h4><strong>Create outlets for frustration.</strong></h4><p>When rats that are exposed to repeated stressors are given a piece of wood to gnaw on, they are far less likely to develop ulcers. Outlets for frustration are another important coping mechanism for stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many unproductive outletsâ€”for example, taking things out on your partner or a co-worker. But there are also many productive ones, like exercise or journaling. Making a list of outlets and making sure to return to them again and again can reduce the havoc that chronic stress can wreak on your body.</p><h4><strong>Increase social support.</strong></h4><p>Social support is the last coping strategy on the list, and itâ€™s perhaps my favorite one.</p><p>If you give a primate a stressor in the lab, youâ€™ll find elevated markers of stress in its behavior and in its blood. But give the primate a stressor when itâ€™s surrounded by friendsâ€”its stress markers will be lower, even for the same level of stressor.</p><p>The same thing happens in humans. For example, in one study parents of children who have been killed in war were no more likely to get disease or dieâ€”except if they were already widowed or divorced.</p><p>Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.</p>

        <p>In this blog post we will go back 10 years to understand how OpenStack started at CERN. In <a href="https://techblog.web.cern.ch/techblog/post/10-years-of-openstack-at-cern-part-1/">Part 1</a> we explored the motivation, the first installation, the prototypes, the deployment challenges and the initial production architecture. Now, we will dive into the service offering evolution of the CERN cloud infrastructure over the last years and how we scaled from 2 cells and few hundred compute nodes to 75 cells with more than 8000 compute nodes.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="service-growth-and-architecture">Service Growth and Architecture</h2>
<p>From the beginning the CERN cloud infrastructure has been very popular within the Organization. As the users started to migrate all their applications to run on top of the cloud infrastructure the number of virtual machines increased very rapidly. In just a few months we were managing several thousand virtual machines running production workloads. At the same time the cloud operations team was busy converting the existing physical servers in the data centre into OpenStack compute nodes.</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>Only 4 months after moving the cloud infrastructure into production we were managing more than 1000 Nova compute nodes. This rapid growth continued during the next months.</p>
<p>At the beginning we designed the infrastructure to have only 2 Nova cells (one cell in the Geneva data centre and the other in the Hungary data centre). These were cellsV1 and there was very little support and experience available at that time in the community.</p>
<p>One question that I get asked frequently is why we configured Nova cells instead of having regions per data centre. The main reason was because we wanted our users to move their workloads as easy as possible to the new infrastructure. Regions would have been another friction for all the users that weren’t that enthusiastic moving from dedicated physical servers (their pets!) to a shared cloud environment (remember, this was 7 years ago!).</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJll5nBclh4%5D"><em>Deep Dive into the CERN Cloud Infrastructure, 2013</em></a></p>
<p>After a few months converting the physical servers already in the data centre to Nova compute nodes and adding them to the Geneva cell we noticed the first flaws in our architecture design. We had a mixture of different hardware types, different retirement cycles and different network segments in the same cell. Also, we had a “zoo” of different workloads running in these compute nodes. They ranged from IT services to scientific data-processing applications to remote desktops. As an example, projects like “CMS Data Acquisition”, “Batch“, “IT Windows Terminal Service” and “Personal Belmiro” were sharing the same compute nodes. This was extremely challenging because of all the different use cases, service expectations and conflicting requirements from the users.</p>
<p>Another problem was that the Geneva cell was reaching almost 2000 compute nodes. Scaling up was starting to be challenging with all the database connections from the compute nodes (this was before running nova-conductor!) and all the pressure in the RabbitMQ cluster. Also, we understood that we had “too many eggs in the same basket”! Any problem affecting the control plane of this large cell would affect almost the entire infrastructure.</p>
<p>Of course the control plane was set up with high-availability in mind. However, this was one of the main causes of our infrastructure problems.</p>
<p>We had a RabbitMQ cluster with mirrored queues per cell. Unfortunately, RabbitMQ issues were constant. There were 2 main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of compute nodes connected to the clusters;</li>
<li>Network partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to support a large number of compute nodes connected to the same RabbitMQ cluster, we needed to fine tune the RabbitMQ configuration options. Today, there are several sources of information that can help in this task (for example the OpenStack Large Scale SIG), but 7 years ago it was very challenging and a continuous try and error approach in the production infrastructure, because it was very difficult to replicate the load in a QA environment.</p>
<p>Old RabbitMQ versions also didn’t play very well with network partitions, leaving the cluster unusable in most of the cases. Whenever the RabbitMQ cluster suffered a network partition, the infrastructure was heavily affected. Also, increasing the number of RabbitMQ nodes in the cluster to deal with the increased number of compute nodes would increase the exposure to even more network partitions.</p>
<p>The OpenStack projects databases were also configured on top of a high available solution. Again, they were not immune to network issues and the recovery was very challenging.</p>
<p>Finally, we were running a distributed control plane in physical servers. This meant that to be really distributed and achieve fault tolerance we needed several physical servers to spread and replicate the different OpenStack projects. The expensive servers available were bought to run intensive workloads and not the less CPU demanding OpenStack projects.</p>

<p>After the learnings of the initial months running the OpenStack infrastructure in production, we decided that it was time to upgrade the architecture to be more resilient and reduce the control plane footprint.</p>
<p>The changes introduced continue to be the foundation of our architecture today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have more but smaller cells;</li>
<li>Run all the control plane in VMs on top of the infrastructure that they manage;</li>
<li>No database clusters;</li>
<li>No RabbitMQ clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss all these different topics.</p>
<h3 id="more-but-smaller-cells">More but smaller cells</h3>
<p>There are several different ways to deploy and scale OpenStack. In our quest to improve the design of the infrastructure architecture we concluded that having multiple cells with only a few hundred compute nodes was a proper fit for our use cases.</p>
<p>Cells offer several advantages that allow us to scale the infrastructure to thousands of compute nodes and at the same time have a resilient, flexible and configurable infrastructure. I would like to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single endpoint: scale horizontally and transparently between different data centres;</li>
<li>Availability and resilience;</li>
<li>Isolate failure domains;</li>
<li>Dedicate cells to projects;</li>
<li>Hardware types per cell;</li>
<li>Different compute nodes configurations per cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>To leverage all these advantages we now don’t have cells with more than 200 compute nodes. This number of compute nodes usually matches the procurement tenders which eases the node distribution. Also, we now don’t mix different hardware types in the same cell.</p>
<p>Having multiple cells and consequently independent control planes for each one, allows to massively scale the infrastructure with relatively small failure domains. Because of the small failure domains (the cell), we don’t need to have a highly available control plane for each individual cell. In fact, each cell control plane (RabbitMQ, nova-conductor, nova-api) runs in a small and individual virtual machine on top of the same infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cells are also used to separate our different workloads. We now dedicate cells for very intensive CPU workloads (LHC batch processing, …), special projects that require a particular configuration (GPUs compute nodes, Hyper-converged compute nodes, …) and the generic workloads (IT services, Remote desktops, …). By having the possibility to fine tune the compute nodes configuration for each particular use case we increase the overall efficiency and resource utilisation. For example, for all cells dedicated to very intensive CPU workloads we don’t allow CPU overcommit, all compute nodes are configured to offer CPU passthrough, huge pages and have KSM disabled.</p>
<p>We also have very small cells with less than 10 compute nodes, configured for very specific research projects.</p>
<p>Cells enabled us to scale and constantly adapt to meet the computing requirements of the Organization.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49CFXNIDM3c"><em>Moving from CellsV1 to CellsV2 at CERN, 2018</em></a></p>
<h3 id="move-the-control-plane-from-physical-nodes-to-vms">Move the control plane from physical nodes to VMs</h3>
<p>After the decision of deploying “more and smaller cells”, it was clear that we would need to allocate more physical servers only for the control plane to maintain the same level of fault tolerance in the infrastructure. Running all the control plane in physical servers was revealing to be not flexible, not scalable, and at the end very expensive.</p>
<p>So, we decided to follow a controversial approach…</p>
<p>Have all the OpenStack control plane (OpenStack projects, RabbitMQ servers, and later even most of the databases) in virtual machines running in the same infrastructure that they manage.</p>
<p>This allows us to have a very distributed and fault tolerant control plane, leveraging the different availability zones available in the infrastructure.</p>
<p>At the beginning we still kept few physical servers running the minimum set of OpenStack services to bootstrap the infrastructure in case of a complete shutdown of the data centres. Today, with all experience that we gained over the years and procedures that we implemented, those physical servers were all removed.</p>
<p>To give some examples, we run the Keystone project in relatively small virtual machines (8GB of RAM, 4vCPUs) that are spread between the 3 availability zones (distributed between 18 Nova cells) in the infrastructure. Currently, we run 16 virtual machines for the Keystone service. The same approach is used for all the other OpenStack projects. Nova-api, Nova-conductor, Nova-scheduler, Glance, Horizon, Neutron… including RabbitMQ clusters and most of the databases.</p>
<p>This approach has proven to be very effective and allowed us to scale rapidly when keeping a small control plane footprint.</p>
<h3 id="clustering-no-clustering">Clustering!? No Clustering!?</h3>
<p>A typical OpenStack architecture design includes running the databases and the message broker in a high available cluster configuration. Of course when we started, we did the same!</p>
<p>In the CERN IT Department there is a team responsible for the …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Let’s travel back to a simpler time when all everyone talked about in machine learning were SVMs and boosted trees,
while Andrew Ng introduced neural networks as a neat party hat trick you would probably never use in practice<sup id="fnref:mlcoursera"><a href="#fn:mlcoursera">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The year is 2012, and computer-vision based competition ImageNet is set to be once again won by the newest ensemble of kernel methods.
That is, of course, until a couple of researchers unveiled AlexNet<sup id="fnref:alexnet"><a href="#fn:alexnet">2</a></sup>, having almost two times lower error rate than the competition,
by using what we now commonly refer to as “deep learning.”</p>

<p>Many people point to AlexNet as one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the decade, certainly one that helped change the landscape of ML research.
However, it does not take much to realize that under the hood, it is “just” a combination of prior iterative improvements, many dating back to the early nineties.
At its core, AlexNet is “just” a modified LeNet<sup id="fnref:lenet"><a href="#fn:lenet">3</a></sup> with more layers, better weight initialization, activation function, and data augmentation.</p>



<p>So what made AlexNet stand out so much? I believe the answer lies in the tools researchers had at their disposal, enabling them to run artificial neural networks on GPU accelerators,
a relatively novel idea at the time.
In fact, Alex Krizhevsky’s former colleagues recall that many meetings before the competition consisted of Alex describing his progress with the CUDA quirks and features.</p>

<p>Now let us travel back to 2015 when ML research article submissions started blowing up across the board,
including (re-)emergence of many now promising approaches such as generative adversarial learning, deep reinforcement learning,
meta-learning, self-supervised learning, federated learning, neural architecture search, neural differential equations, neural graph networks, and many more.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/770/1*Y-CZdwBP2L_XW1YRLdxt0A.png" alt="">
<span>Image via <a href="https://medium.com/@dcharrezt/neurips-2019-stats-c91346d31c8f" target="_blank">Charrez, D. (2019)</a>.</span></p>

<p>One could claim that this is just a natural outcome of the AI hype. However, I believe a significant factor was the emergence of the second generation of general-purpose
ML frameworks such as TensorFlow<sup id="fnref:tf"><a href="#fn:tf">4</a></sup> and PyTorch<sup id="fnref:pt"><a href="#fn:pt">5</a></sup>, along with NVIDIA going all-in on AI. The frameworks that existed before, such as Caffe<sup id="fnref:caffe"><a href="#fn:caffe">6</a></sup> and Theano<sup id="fnref:theano"><a href="#fn:theano">7</a></sup>,
were challenging to work with, and awkward to extend, which slowed down the research and development of novel ideas.</p>

<h2 id="a-need-for-innovation">A Need for Innovation</h2>

<p>TensorFlow and PyTorch were undoubtedly a net positive, and the teams worked hard to improve the libraries.
Recently, they delivered TensorFlow 2.0 with a more straightforward interface along with eager mode<sup id="fnref:tfe"><a href="#fn:tfe">8</a></sup>,
and PyTorch 1.0 with JIT compilation of the computation graph<sup id="fnref:ts"><a href="#fn:ts">9</a></sup> as well as support for XLA<sup id="fnref:xla"><a href="#fn:xla">10</a></sup> based accelerators such as TPUs<sup id="fnref:tpu"><a href="#fn:tpu">11</a></sup>.
However, these frameworks are also beginning to reach their limits, forcing researchers into some paths while closing doors on others, just like their predecessors.</p>

<p>High-profile DRL projects such as AlphaStar<sup id="fnref:alphastar"><a href="#fn:alphastar">12</a></sup> and OpenAI Five<sup id="fnref:dota"><a href="#fn:dota">13</a></sup> not only utilized large-scale computational clusters
but also pushed the limits of deep learning architecture components by combining deep transformers, nested recurrent networks, deep residual towers, among others.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/demis-hassabis-interview-the-brains-behind-deepmind-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-mzk0zhsp8" target="_blank">interview with The Times newspaper</a>,
Demis Hassabis has stated that DeepMind will be focusing on applying AI directly for scientific breakthroughs.
We can already see a glimpse of that shift in direction with some of their recent Nature articles on neuroscience<sup id="fnref:dopamine"><a href="#fn:dopamine">14</a></sup> and protein folding<sup id="fnref:alphafold"><a href="#fn:alphafold">15</a></sup>.
Even a brief skim through the publications is enough to see that the projects required some unconventional approaches when it comes to engineering.</p>

<p>At NeurIPS 2019, probabilistic programming and bayesian inference were hot topics, especially uncertainty estimation and causal inference.
Leading AI researchers presented their visions on what the future of ML might look like.
Notably, Yoshua Bengio described transitioning to <a href="https://slideslive.com/38921750/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning" target="_blank">system 2 deep learning</a>
with out-of-distribution generalization, sparse graph networks, and causal reasoning.</p>

<p>To summarize, some of the requirements for next-gen ML tools are:</p>

<ul>
<li>fine-grained control flow use</li>
<li>non-standard optimization loops</li>
<li>higher-order differentiation as a first-class citizen</li>
<li>probabilistic programming as a first-class citizen</li>
<li>support for multiple heterogeneous accelerators in one model</li>
<li>seamless scalability from a single machine to gigantic clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the tools should also maintain a clean, straightforward, and extensible API, enabling scientists to research and develop their ideas rapidly.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>

<p>The good news is that many candidates already exist today, emerging in response to the needs in scientific computing.
From experimental projects like Zygote.jl<sup id="fnref:zygote"><a href="#fn:zygote">16</a></sup> to even specialized languages, e.g. Halide<sup id="fnref:halide"><a href="#fn:halide">17</a></sup> and DiffTaichi<sup id="fnref:taichi"><a href="#fn:taichi">18</a></sup>.
Interestingly, many projects draw inspiration from the fundamental works done by researchers in the auto-diff community<sup id="fnref:ad-survey"><a href="#fn:ad-survey">19</a></sup>, which evolved in parallel to ML.</p>

<p>Many of them were featured at the recent NeurIPS 2019 <a href="https://program-transformations.github.io/" target="_blank">workshop on program transformations</a>.
The two I am most excited about are S4TF<sup id="fnref:s4tf"><a href="#fn:s4tf">20</a></sup> and JAX<sup id="fnref:jax"><a href="#fn:jax">21</a></sup>.
They both tackle the task of making differentiable programming into an integral part of the toolchain, but in their own ways, almost orthogonal to each other.</p>

<h3 id="swift-for-tensorflow">Swift for TensorFlow</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, S4TF tightly integrates the TensorFlow ML framework with the Swift programming language.
A vote of confidence for the project is that it is led by Chris Lattner, who has authored LLVM<sup id="fnref:llvm"><a href="#fn:llvm">22</a></sup>, Clang<sup id="fnref:clang"><a href="#fn:clang">23</a></sup>, and Swift itself.</p>

<p>Swift is a compiled programming language, and one of its primary selling points is
the powerful type system that is static and inferred. What the last part means in
simpler terms is that Swift encompasses ease of use in languages like Python
with code validations and transformations at compile-time, e.g., as in C++.</p>

<pre><code>let a: Int = 1
let b = 2
let c = "3"

print(a + b)         // 3
print(b + c)         // compilation (!) error
print(String(b) + c) // 23
</code></pre>

<p>Swift features enable the S4TF team to meet quite a few requirements in the next-generation list
by having analysis, verification, and optimization of the computation graph executed with efficient algorithms during compilation.</p>

<p>Crucially, the handling of automatic differentiation is off-loaded to the compiler.</p>

<pre><code>struct Linear: Differentiable {
  var w: Float
  var b: Float

  func callAsFunction(_ x: Float) -&gt; Float {
    return w * x + b
  }
}

let f = Linear(w: 1, b: 2)
let 𝛁f = gradient(at: f) { f in f(3.0) }
print(𝛁f) // TangentVector(w: 3.0, b: 1.0)

let 𝛁f2 = gradient(at: f) { f in f([3.0]) } // compilation (!) error
// error: cannot convert value of type '[Float]' to expected argument type 'Float'
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, TensorFlow itself is very well supported in this case.</p>

<pre><code>import TensorFlow

struct Model: Layer {
    var conv = Conv2D&lt;Float&gt;(filterShape: (5, 5, 6, 16), activation: relu)
    var pool = MaxPool2D&lt;Float&gt;(poolSize: (2, 2), strides: (2, 2))
    var flatten = Flatten&lt;Float&gt;()
    var dense = Dense&lt;Float&gt;(inputSize: 16 * 5 * 5, outputSize: 100, activation: relu)
    var logits = Dense&lt;Float&gt;(inputSize: 100, outputSize: 10, activation: identity)

    @differentiable
    func callAsFunction(_ input: Tensor&lt;Float&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;Float&gt; {
        return input.sequenced(through: conv, pool, flatten, dense, logits)
    }
}

var model = Model()
let optimizer = RMSProp(for: model, learningRate: 3e-4, decay: 1e-6)

for batch in CIFAR10().trainDataset.batched(128) {
  let (loss, gradients) = valueWithGradient(at: model) { model in
    softmaxCrossEntropy(logits: model(batch.data), labels: batch.label)
  }
  print(loss)
  optimizer.update(&amp;model, along: gradients)
}
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if a critical feature is proving to be difficult to implement,
having intimate knowledge of the whole pipeline is particularly valuable.
For example, the <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/" target="_blank">MLIR</a> compiler framework is a direct result of the S4TF efforts.</p>

<p>While differentiable programming is the core goal, S4TF is much more than that with a plan to support the
infrastructure for various next-gen ML tools such as debuggers.
For example, imagine an IDE warning a user that the custom model computation always results in a zero gradient
without even executing it.</p>

<p>Python has an incredible community built around scientific computing and the S4TF team has explicitly
taken the time to embrace it via interoperability.</p>

<pre><code>import Python // All that is necessary to enable the interop.

let np = Python.import("numpy") // Can import any Python module.
let plt = Python.import("matplotlib.pyplot") 

let x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.01)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x)) // Can use the modules as if inside Python.
plt.show() // Will show the sin plot, just as you would expect.
</code></pre>

<p>This project is a significant undertaking and still has some ways to go before being ready for production.
However, this is a great time to give it a try for both engineers and researchers and potentially contribute to its development.<br>
Work on S4TF has already produced interesting scientific advancements at the intersection of programming language and auto-diff theory<sup id="fnref:diff-curry"><a href="#fn:diff-curry">24</a></sup>.</p>

<p>One thing that especially stands out for me about S4TF is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/sigs/swift/CHARTER.md" target="_blank">their approach to community outreach</a>.
For example, the core developers hold weekly design sessions, which are open for anyone interested to join and even participate.</p>

<h3 id="jax">JAX</h3>

<p>JAX is a collection of function transformations such as just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation,
implemented as a thin wrapper over XLA with an API that is essentially a drop-in replacement for NumPy and SciPy.
In fact, one way to get started with JAX is to think of it as an accelerator backed NumPy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I moved from regular full stack web development (C# and JavaScript, mostly Angular) to the world of content, developer relations, and developer advocacy in August 2018 when I joined <a href="http://www.auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a>. It's a lot of fun, but no one tells you just <em>how much stuff there is to do.</em> At any given time, I could be:</p><ul><li>Writing a blog post</li><li>Answering questions on Twitter, Slack, Discord, or various Discourse forums</li><li>Making videos, either as a side hustle or for work</li><li>Figuring out how to integrate Auth0 with X language or Y framework</li><li>Building and improving programs like <a href="https://auth0.com/ambassador-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Ambassadors</a></li><li>Collaborating with other companies on content</li><li><a href="http://www.samjulien.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming</a></li><li>Building a talk</li><li>Applying to events</li><li>Giving a talk (whether in person or online)</li><li>Appearing on a podcast</li><li>Working with other teams in the company (like the SDK team or product marketing teams) to provide developer feedback and improve the product</li></ul><p>It can be dizzying! Without some good systems in place, it would be incredibly easy to work <em>all the time</em>. In fact, that's how I was starting to feel as I finished my first year. I felt like someone could wake me up in the middle of the night and my first response would be to start typing at an invisible computer or give a talk to the chickens.</p><p>I'm about 18 months into this and I feel like I'm finally starting to get some traction on prioritizing and being productive without losing my mind. So, in this article, I'm going to write out what's been working for me lately in my unending quest to balance life and dev rel. I don't pretend to have all the answers here, but I do hope I can save you some time.</p><p>My favorite way to write about what I've been learning is by first laying out some "cloud level" <strong>overarching principles</strong> that I've been noticing and then getting down to the nitty-gritty "street level" <strong>strategies and tactics</strong> that are working for me. As always, this is the stuff that has worked for me. Adjust to suit your own needs and personality!</p><p><em>Note: I'm just going to use the term "dev rel" from here on out for convenience, but this could be any iteration of developer advocacy, evangelism, content, community, or anything else. Think of it as a synonym for "that part of being a developer that involves building relationships and creating content," whether that's your full time job or a side gig.</em></p><p>As I've moved through this last 18 months, I've picked up on some high-level principles that are making my life better. Think of them as signposts along the road: they don't tell you exactly how to get to your next destination, but they point you in the right direction if you pay attention to them.</p><h2>Principle 1: Dev rel is a new set of skills to learn <!-- -->—<!-- --> embrace it!</h2><p>When you first transition to dev rel, it can be incredibly overwhelming. Most of the time, the reason we have moved into dev rel is because we were reasonably good at our engineering jobs but wanted to do more teaching and community-building. Suddenly, we've gone from "competent engineer" to "brand new developer advocate" and that <em>sucks</em>. This brings me to the first principle I want you to remember: <strong>dev rel is a new set of skills you can learn</strong>.</p><p>You are once again a beginner! You're back at square one (or square zero since we're all nerds here). If you feel totally overwhelmed or like you suck at your job, this is not because something is wrong with you as a person <!-- -->—<!-- --> it's because you need to learn and practice a new set of skills! Once I realized that, I felt so much better. So, first and foremost, cut yourself some slack (not Slack)!</p><p>The real magic comes when you not only accept that reality, but learn to embrace it. It's not that often in life that we get to learn new skills (though as developers we are incredibly lucky in that way). New skills mean new opportunities for creativity, new ways of looking at things, and new relationships. And that feeling of discomfort and discontent? That's growth as a human! Growth is good!</p><h2>Principle 2: Focus on shipping and improving instead of waiting for perfection.</h2><p>Perfection is the enemy of getting things done, but this seems to be especially true for dev rel. It's really easy to start a dozen projects, blog articles, video course outlines, and open source libraries <!-- -->—<!-- --> it's way harder to finish them. Why is that? Often it's because we like the <em>idea</em> of a hypothetical, perfect version of something more than the <em>reality</em> of the hard work it takes to execute something. When we go to work on that project, we get so overwhelmed by the disparity between our Perfect Vision and the blank page that we give up and go back to daydreaming.</p><p>This is a great way to get fired. It's way better for your job and your mental health to build and ship something <!-- -->—<!-- --> no matter how small <!-- -->—<!-- --> so you can start getting feedback, achieving some results, and improving on it. I love how <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Hoy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexhillman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Hillman</a> call this <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stacking bricks</a>.</p><p>A good rule of thumb here is to ship something when it's 80% done and you're stll a little bit embarrassed about it. You can always improve on it later! I learned this lesson a few years back and wrote about a process I use for myself called <a href="https://www.samjulien.com/feedback-loop">The Feedback Loop</a>.</p><h2>Principle 3: Don't try to automate too quickly.</h2><p>I don't know if this is a developer thing, but I have a tendency to overcomplicate things and try to automate them way too quickly. This usually comes from a desire to be <em>efficient</em> or <em>elegant</em> in my implementation so I (naively) add (unnecessary) complexity. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about: after six months or a year, you come back to the code you wrote and realize you can drastically simplify it. Why is that? It's because you know what's important and what's not due to experience.</p><p>The same is true with dev rel. My first response to being overwhelmed was to TRY EVERYTHING and THROW EVERYTHING AT THE WALL:</p><ul><li>Download all the productivity apps!</li><li>Set up complex email filtering!</li><li>Buy all the gear!</li><li>Over-engineer systems to automate everything!</li></ul><p>That was a quick road to burnout because I was giving myself way too much overhead. Instead, what I've learned is to <strong>go slow now in order to go fast later</strong>. I needed to slow down and figure out what was bringing the biggest return in order to find the ways I could systematize and automate it.</p><p>Incidentally, I went through this exact same cycle when I was learning about camping, hiking, and backpacking. I overcomplicated things and, over time, watched as the gear I needed eventually shrank to <em>exactly what I needed, when I needed it</em>.</p><p>As you venture forth in dev rel, look for those three signposts to keep you on the right path:</p><ul><li>Be kind to yourself and embrace that you're learning new skills</li><li>Focus on shipping and improving</li><li>Resist premature automation</li></ul><p>Okay, so we've got some principles. Let's get down to the street-level implementation for daily work.</p><h2>Strategy 1: Determine your priorities.</h2><p>Given that we could be doing a million different things at literally any time of day or night, it becomes impossible to do everything. You <em>have</em> to create some sort of decision matrix or rubric for prioritizing. If you've got a boss, I'd highly recommend you talk this out. Define priorities and "big wins." When <a href="https://twitter.com/KimMaida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Maida</a> was my boss, we did just that, and here's what we came up with.</p><p>Prioritize projects that:</p><ul><li>Other people depend on (e.g. that internal tool that other people need)</li><li>Involve collaboration with other team members or internal teams (a lot of developer advocacy work goes here)</li><li>Involve collaboration with other companies or create those opportunities (streams, joint blog posts, open source collaboration, etc)</li><li>Create opportunities for other people to learn or advance their career (programs like <a href="https://auth0.com/guest-authors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Guest Authors</a> run by <a href="https://twitter.com/kapehe_ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kapehe</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/ambassador-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Ambasadors</a>)</li></ul><p>Notice the trend? It's <em>other people</em>, which is really what this whole job is about. I had lunch with <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Lengstorf</a> in Portland a few months back and he gave me the exact same advice: collaborate as much as possible. Dev rel can be extremely isolated at times, especially when working remote and traveling alone. Collaboration not only dramatically increases your impact (and thus helps more people), it also keeps you from losing your mind.</p><p>Of course, there are tasks you must do alone:</p><ul><li>CFPs, building solo talks</li><li>Experimenting with new tech</li><li>Working on your "personal brand" (I hate this term because it's so overused, but here I mean your personal site and email)</li><li>Creating most types of content</li><li>Learning new things to keep your engineering skills sharp</li></ul><p>How do we prioritize and schedule all that? I'm glad you asked!</p><h2>Strategy 2: Block out your schedule.</h2><p>Being remote and mostly autonomous can be great, but it can also lead to a sort of paralysis as you become solely responsible for your schedule. I wrote in my article <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/surprises-in-my-switch-to-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprises in My Switch to Remote Work</a> that it's kind of like getting rid of the governor on an engine.</p><p>Here's what I've figured out so far (and I'm still learning).</p><p>First, I make all meetings 30 minutes by default if I can help it. If it's going to take longer than 30 minutes, it's more of a brainstorming session. Nine times out of ten, 30 minutes is plenty of time to hash out who needs to do what to make progress. The rest can happen asynchronously on Slack or via email.</p><p>I've also started time-blocking my calendar roughly every Sunday night. Generally I have three types of blocks for working on projects:</p><ul><li>2 hours: dedicated focus time. I find that the difference between "completely overwhelmed" and "I know the next step" is nearly always 2 hours of focused work.</li><li>1 hour: maintenance. This is stuff like documentation, program maintenance, or tasks I need to get done.</li><li>30 minutes: admin or communications. This is the stuff I'm terrible at, so I book it in 30 minute chunks to stay focused and knock things off of my to-do list.</li></ul><p>When it comes to actually deciding where to put things, I follow the "big rocks" approach:</p><ul><li>Anything that involves other people, whether meetings or high priority collaborative work, I prioritize 4 days per week from 9 am to 2 pm.</li><li>We have Thursdays set aside as "no meeting days" on our team, so I use that day to do anything totally solo.</li><li>I do that same …</li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><em>A partnership between InfluxData and Ockam brings trust to time series data.</em></p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Let's investigate how to build applications with trusted time series data in a zero trust environment! To trust an application we need to trust the data that feeds into it. Increasingly, applications rely on time series data from outside the datacenter, at the edge, or in IoT. This means we need to think of trust and data in new ways.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">This is why InfluxData and Ockam have partnered to bring trust to time series data streams and data warehouses. First let’s start with the challenges faced by application developers;</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Time series data typically needs to traverse multiple networks to connect a machine at the edge with InfluxDB in the cloud. This makes it nearly impossible to control a network perimeter - particularly for an application developer.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">The Zero Trust network architecture principles give guidance to how we should think about connections between the edge and InfluxDB. A Zero Trust architecture is based on the assumptions that;</p><ul><li>The network is always hostile,</li><li>External and internal threats exist on the network at all times,</li><li>Network locality is not sufficient for determining trust in a network,</li><li>Every device, user, and network flow must be authenticated and authorized,</li><li>Security and privacy policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible.</li></ul><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">To build an application that places zero trust in network boundaries can be challenging for an application architect who simply wants to connect an agent, like Telegraf, running on a device at the edge to a cloud hosted instance of InfluxDB. That’s why InfluxData has partnered with Ockam. Ockam abstracts away the complexities required to build such distributed applications.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Let's look at the components that make up Ockam's systems, and how they provide security and privacy to time series data streams.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><a href="https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam">Ockam is an open source</a> suite of tools, programming libraries and infrastructure that makes it easy to build devices that communicate securely, privately and trustfully with cloud services and other devices. Security, Privacy and Trust are application layer concerns and IoT developers should have simple tools to granularly control these aspects of their applications.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Ockam has taken proven cryptographic building blocks and applied them to build solutions for common IoT and edge-computing problems like:</p><ul><li>Secure, rapid enrollment of large fleets of devices.</li><li>Scalable provisioning, proof of possession, rotation, and revocation of identity keys and credentials.</li><li>End-to-end encrypted communication over low-bandwidth, intermittently connected, multi-protocol IoT and edge network topologies.</li></ul><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">The goal is to provide this functionality in multiple programming languages with secure, high-level application interfaces that are easy to use correctly and hard to misuse. Let’s look at some of the core features of Ockam’s tools:</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><a href="https://www.ockam.io/89fcbd3b155375c3d2a8bda719c74ca1/architecture.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.ockam.io/89fcbd3b155375c3d2a8bda719c74ca1/architecture.svg" alt="Ockam Architecture, Features, Add-ons"></a></p><h2 id="end-to-end-encrypted-secure-channels" color="heading" font-family="heading" font-weight="heading">End-to-end encrypted secure channels<a href="#end-to-end-encrypted-secure-channels"></a></h2><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Ockam’s Secure Channels provide end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated communication that is safe against eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery of messages sent across multiple application layer hops. This enables an application to place zero trust in network boundaries and instead delivers granular control to application developers on what data is revealed where in their system.</p><h2 id="machine-identity-and-access-management" color="heading" font-family="heading" font-weight="heading">Machine identity and access management<a href="#machine-identity-and-access-management"></a></h2><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Application developers need fine-grained control over data access in their systems, this can only be achieved if all interactions are mutually authenticated. To enable this, all devices must have unique cryptographically provable identities and access control must be managed with secure credentials. Enrolling large fleets of devices and managing the lifecycle of their keys and credentials can be quite challenging at scale. Ockam includes easy to use cryptographic protocols for;</p><ul><li>Device Enrollment</li><li>Policy Enforcement</li><li>Key Management, Rotation, and Revocation</li><li>Credential Issuance
...and more.</li></ul><h2 id="built-for-influxdb-developers" color="heading" font-family="heading" font-weight="heading">Built for InfluxDB developers<a href="#built-for-influxdb-developers"></a></h2><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Ockam includes a suite of robust cryptographic protocols, accessible through simple to use programming libraries, that enable application developers to focus on the trust rules and policies of their IoT and time series data-dependent applications.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">The Ockam programming libraries help easily encode, business specific, granular access control logic into applications without having to deal with the complexities of cryptographic protocols or falling back to weak, coarse grained security based on network boundaries. If you are building an application with InfluxDB, adding trust with Ockam is easy.
InfluxDB and Telegraf Add-ons for Ockam are easy to integrate</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><span>

    </span></p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">There are two ways to use Ockam with InfluxDB. Let’s start with Ockam Hub.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">Ockam Hub is a service hosted in a cloud environment that makes it easy to route messages between an unlimited number of machines at the edge and InfluxDB. While it may work in a prototype, TLS is not the right tool for the job of securing our data streams at scale. It’s impossible to control the network boundary across the multiple networks you are likely to encounter in the real world, issuing unique tokens or credentials is onerous at enterprise scale, and it’s not user friendly for a typical application layer developer. Ockam Hub solves all of these problems, and more.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text">If you are deploying Telegraf agents into machines we have a solution for you as well. OckamD is a daemon that runs alongside Telegraf and is downloadable from Github. OckamD and Telegraf are preconfigured to create an end-to-end encrypted messaging channel all the way to your InfluxDB instance in the cloud.</p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><strong>It’s that easy!</strong></p><p font-family="body" font-weight="body" font-size="body" color="text"><a href="https://www.ockam.io/learn/how-to-guides/using-add-ons/enterprise/influxdb/telegraf-influxdb-with-ockamd/">Click here to run the demo</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.</p><p>We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/the-indian-government-may-ban-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html">proposed ban</a>, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should <em>buy</em> Bitcoin rather than <em>ban </em>Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.</p><h2 id="1-crypto-is-now-a-trillion-dollar-industry">1.

His creation solved an <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoins-proof-of-work-the-problem-of-the-byzantine-generals-33dc4540442">unsolved problem</a> in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.</p><p>Yes, you read that right: <em>trillion</em>. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">today</a>, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png 783w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!</figcaption></figure><p>So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it's led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don't get how large the space is. Let's give some more numbers.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/what-is-ethereum">Ethereum</a>, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a></em>, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.</li><li>Ethereum has given birth to an entire sector called <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi">decentralized finance</a></em> ("defi") which is to traditional finance ("tradfi") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost <a href="https://defipulse.com/">$30B in assets</a> are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.</li><li>The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-on-pace-to-settle-over-1-trillion-in-transactions-in-2020-analyst/">&gt;$1T in volume</a> in 2020, more than PayPal.</li><li>So-called "<a href="http://stablecoinstats.com/">stablecoins</a>" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.</li><li>The website coinmarketcap.com has a higher Alexa ranking (<a href="https://archive.is/wip/OJv3Y">#324 at last check</a>) than the website wsj.com (last ranked <a href="https://archive.is/wip/tgPHo">as #440</a>). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal's official website! And that flip first occurred in <a href="https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/893557870897184768">2017</a>.</li><li>The research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=18205202439612985620&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">13,000 times</a> by professors at places like <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses/cs251-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-technologies">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/introduction-blockchain-and-bitcoin?delta=0">Harvard</a>, and <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">applied cryptography</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07091.pdf">distributed computing</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/cryptocurrency-startups">More than five billion dollars</a> in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world's top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png 860w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Annual crypto transaction volumes are now in <a href="https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1318985292347543552">excess of $1T</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here's some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/01/price-of-bitcoin-jumps-after-elon-musk-says-it-is-a-good-thing"><em>Elon Musk</em></a><em>:</em> The world's richest man has said that Bitcoin is "inevitable" and changed his Twitter bio to simply "#Bitcoin".</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1297640002604527621"><em>The IMF</em></a>: Cryptocurrency could "completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills" and "could be the next step in the evolution of money."</li><li><a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/pt/293821525702130886/pdf/Cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain.pdf"><em>The World Bank</em></a>: "Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are<br>part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized."</li><li><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-treasury-secretary-larry-summers-says-bitcoin-is-here-to-stay"><em>Larry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary</em></a>: "Bitcoin is here to stay" and the "financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin."</li></ul><p>At this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there's an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.</p><p>But it's actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn't just an economic sector, it's a <em>civilizational advance</em> on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.</p><h2 id="2-national-security-crypto-means-india-can-t-be-deplatformed">2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed</h2><p>As noted above, a <a href="https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/draft-banning-cryptocurrency-regulation-official-digital-currency-bill-2019">recent bill</a> introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India's national security. But as we'll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually <em>essential</em> to India's national security.</p><h3 id="bitcoin-prevents-financial-deplatforming">Bitcoin prevents financial deplatforming</h3><p>First, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a <em>centralized</em> currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are <em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp#:~:text=Decentralized%20currency%2C%20peer%2Dto%2D,central%20bank%2C%20like%20U.S.%20dollars.">decentralized</a></em> international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-jpm-idUSKBN29A1IF">digital gold</a>, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.</p><p>It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045">3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.</p><p>Similarly, for the same reason that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-leader-condemns-twitter-facebook-blocking-trump-75123130">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/11/problematic-twitter-merkel-france-trump/">France</a> expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347902693537239040">national replacements</a> for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.</p><p>Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/in/all/top-free/">dependent</a> on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like <a href="https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/">SWIFT</a>, PayPal, or Google Pay.</p><p>What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/amazon-viral-fire-photos-fake-misleading-leonardo-dicaprio/">fake photo</a> of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/amazon-fires-show-limits-sovereignty/596779/">invasion of Brazil</a>. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.</p><p>In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/India-permanently-bans-TikTok-and-58-other-Chinese-apps#:~:text=The%20ministry's%20June%20order%20stated,of%20state%20and%20public%20order.%22">TikTok ban</a>, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.</p><h2 id="3-foreign-investment-crypto-brings-capital-to-india">3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India</h2><p>A second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight. But the opposite is true.</p><p>After all, what do <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/elon-musk-on-clubhouse-i-am-a-supporter-of-bitcoin.html">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/">Marc Andreessen</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/09/17/billionaire-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reveals-why-bitcoin-is-the-best-internet-currency/?sh=57f875e4439e">Jack Dorsey</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/peter-thiel-is-betting-on-bitcoin-to-be-the-online-equivalent-to-gold.html">Peter Thiel</a>, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244859">Reid Hoffman</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/prominent-silicon-valley-investor-naval-doesnt-think-bitcoin-goes-to-3k-again/">Naval Ravikant</a>, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-reasons-why-chamath-loves-crypto/">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, and countless CEOs, founders, angels, and venture capitalists have in common? They all support Bitcoin. So do Russian and Chinese ancestry entrepreneurs like <a href="https://thecoinshark.net/blockchain-news/pavel-durov-told-about-his-investments-in-bitcoin">Pavel Durov</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-2021-a-brief-interview-with-changpeng-zhao-7jh32js">Changpeng Zhao</a>. The value of Bitcoin is something leaders in the global tech community agree on, like the internet or open source.</p><p>Estimates vary, but if and when Bitcoin hits $200,000 per BTC, my colleague Olaf Carson-Wee at Polychain Capital <a href="https://balajis.com/the-billionaire-flippening/">estimated</a> that roughly 25-50% of the world's billionaires will come from cryptocurrency.</p><p>As such, if India bans cryptocurrency, it doesn't just criminalize the holdings of countless innocent Indians. It repels a trillion dollars in crypto capital from coming to India in the first place. The proposed crypto ban would <em>itself</em> cause capital flight.</p><p>And <em>capitalist</em> flight. Lest we forget, Indian entrepreneurs are highly <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/at-17-5-million-indian-diaspora-largest-in-the-world-un-report/articleshow/71179163.cms?from=mdr">mobile</a>. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are already worth many billions of dollars; so are cryptocurrency mining companies and new digital currencies like Ethereum. All the Indian analogs to those services would happen overseas, as Indian founders are once again forced to move abroad.</p><p>Conversely, the right crypto policy would cause not capital flight, but <em>capital landing</em>. Visualize billions of dollars in cryptocurrency landing in India.

      <p>I think a lot about how people discover content. Itâ€™s an important thing for media companies to understand, for obvious reasons. But itâ€™s also a fascinating instance of the more general question of how distribution channels evolve over time. Thereâ€™s always a tension between the network effects that keep people coming back to historically entrenched channels, and the innovative new features that pull people towards new ones.</p>
<p>So when I heard that Breaker (a podcast app focused on social discovery of content) was <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Twitter, I was intrigued. It was an acqui-hire, so itâ€™s logical to wonder whether something about the â€œsocial podcast discoveryâ€� thesis was wrong. Do people not want social recommendations for podcasts in the same way we seem to obsess over social recommendations for articles on Twitter and Facebook? Or is there something else keeping us attached to our current apps?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve spent the last month wrestling with these questions in my spare time, and ended up forming three specific hypotheses that should be interesting to anyone who studies media.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what I got, and how I got there:</p>
<h2>What I believed about podcasting in 2016</h2>
<p>Before I ever heard of Breaker, I wanted someone to build a â€œsocially-sortedâ€� podcast app that would help me listen to a wider variety of shows based on episode-level recommendations from friends. I even wrote a <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it in early 2016, fully convinced this future was inevitable!Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s the key line:</p>
<p><em>â€œA decade ago, when blogging was in its infancy, geeks used RSS readers to find out about new content. Then, Facebook and Twitter came along with socially-sorted news feeds, and the RSS readers quickly died. I believe the same thing is about to happen to podcasts.â€�</em></p>

<p>I reject big tech's monopoly on moderation. </p>
<p>In these strange times during 2021 I have found myself longing for an Internet controlled by the people and <em>not powered</em> by a global dragnet on the common person (often mislabelled as advertisement). These "advertisements" are <a href="https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comic/supernormal-stimuli/#page-1">superhuman stimuli</a> which track and follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile" target="_blank">all humans</a>.
</p>

<p>
I consider these sorts of "advertisements" to be a form digital stalking (an outlawed, mentally and emotionally abusive action). </p>
<p>Big tech nudges YOU for attention and nudges YOU to spend. Big tech uses computers to track and profile preferences, tolerances, sex, geo-location, race, political affiliation, and more with the aim of to exploring and exploiting you, your family, your friends... everyone.</p>

<p>
We must demand updates to our laws to prevent big tech from hiding behind their terms of service and corporate protections while claiming it is legal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking" target="_blank">cyberstalk</a> all humans. </p>
<p>Get yourself out of the loop! We are all absolutely addicted to this stuff. These psychic manipulations work on the subconscious of all animals; no one is immune.</p>
<p>The future doesn't have to be doom and gloom. We can build a better way. We may not be able to compete with their datacenters or balance sheets, but perhaps we don't need to. </p>
<p>We must keep the conversation going and we must not shut down speech. We must not be afraid to talk, otherwise we will lose our ability to find compromise and a healthy path forward. </p>
<p><strong>Starting today, Remarkbox is free.</strong></p>
<p>If this resonates with you, follow this two-minute <a href="https://my.remarkbox.com/setup" target="_blank">guided setup</a> to use the software anywhere that supports HTML (web pages, static blogs). </p>
<p>We already have our own platforms, it's about time we start using them! </p>
<p>Most of the groundwork has already been laid out. Let's roll up our sleeves and build! </p>
<p>If you have ideas, software, or tech which could be operationalized to help build a new social cloud, please reach out to me, I would like to hear from you. </p>
<p><a href="https://russell.ballestrini.net/contact/" target="_blank">https://russell.ballestrini.net/contact/</a></p>
<p>I leave you with this: be good to one another, use your speech to move people positively and follow the virtuous path, stay civil and moderate your own online discourse. </p>
<p>Those who control the narrative control history, and the future. Let us not stand idle during these times. We must not allow the powerful to have a monopoly on the moderation of speech. </p>
<p>Regardless of the labels and stereotypes tossed my way (even by friends), I choose freedom, and I choose to speak. I hope you do too. </p>
<p>We must not accept the old normal or the new normal. We have not been defeated, we must not be domesticated by the powerful. Let's build a better future together.</p>
<p>As always, please act civil when you speak your mind in the comments box below. I'd like to hear you, but I will moderate the discourse if things go sour.</p>
<p> After all I have that power, and so do you. </p>

        <p>This site is pretty new at this stage, and we’re working on improving things. If you have feedback or found a site we don’t have listed, visit our <a href="https://github.com/adamfowlerit/msportals.io">GitHub page</a> and let us know there.</p>

<h2 id="q--a">Q &amp; A</h2>

<p>Q: <em>Should you trust this site? How do you know the links are safe?</em></p>

<p>A: You don’t know these links are safe, but going to a single source should be better than Googling/Binging what you’re looking for and clicking one of the first results. Check - does the link go to microsoft.com or azure.com as the top level domain? Don’t just trust the text used on the page for the link, hover your cursor over it and see where the link actually goes to. Are you seeing an Azure AD login page that has customizations specific to your company before entering your credentials? Apply this to anything on the internet!</p>

<p>Q: <em>Why does this site exist?</em></p>

<p>A: Because there are so many Microsoft portals, and no single source of truth for them all. We probably don’t have every single portal, but if you know of ones we are missing, please let us know via GitHub - do a pull request if you know how, or just write an issue with the details and we’ll sort it out. It’s easy!</p>

<p>In this first of a series of posts, I will be describing how to build a machine learning-based fake news detector from scratch. That means I will literally construct a system that learns how to discern reality from lies (reasonably well), using nothing but raw data. And our project will take us all the way from initial setup to deployed solution. Full source code <a href="https://github.com/mihail911/fake-news">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m doing this because when you look at the state of tutorials today, machine learning projects for beginners mean copy-pasting some sample code off the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> website and running it through an overused benchmark dataset.</p>
<p>In these posts, I will describe a viable sequence for carrying a machine learning product through a realistic lifecycle, trying to be as true as possible to the details. </p>
<p>I will go into the nitty-gritty of the technology decisions, down to how I would organize the code repository structure for fast engineering iteration. As I progress through the posts, I will incrementally add code to the <a href="https://github.com/mihail911/fake-news">repository</a> until at the end I have a fully functional and deployable system.</p>
<p>These posts will cover all of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ideation, organizing your codebase, and setting up tooling (this post!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/performing-exploratory-data-analysis/">Dataset acquisition and exploratory data analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/machine-learning-project-model-v1">Building and testing the pipeline with a v1 model</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/machine-learning-project-error-analysis-model-v2/">Performing error analysis and iterating toward a v2 model</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/machine-learning-project-model-deployment/">Deploying the model and connecting a continuous integration solution</a></li>
</ol>
<p>With that let’s get started!</p>
<h2>Building Machine Learning Systems is Hard</h2>
<p>There’s no easy way to say this: building a fully-fledged ML system is complex. Starting from the very beginning, the process for a functional and useful system contains at least all of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ideation and defining of your problem statement</li>
<li>Acquiring (or labelling) of a dataset </li>
<li>Exploration of your data to understand its characteristics </li>
<li>Building a training pipeline for an initial version of your model</li>
<li>Testing and performing error analysis on your model’s failure modes</li>
<li>Iterating from this error analysis to build improved models</li>
<li>Repeating steps 4-6 until you get the model performance you need</li>
<li>Building the infrastructure to deploy your model with the runtime characteristics your users want</li>
<li>Monitoring your model consistently and use that to repeat any of steps 2-8</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds like a lot? It is. </p>
<p>And here’s what the current machine learning tooling/infrastructure landscape looks like (PC to <a href="https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/">FSDL</a>): </p>

<p>When you couple the inherent complexity of building a machine learning product with the myriad tooling decision points, it’s no surprise that many companies report <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/">87% of their data science projects never making it into production</a>! </p>
<p>Any of the steps 1-9 above introduce numerous places where a project can hit an insurmountable roadblock, and the breadth of technologies and skills required to deliver on a successful project make amassing a team able to deliver equally challenging. </p>
<p>It’s hard, but that’s the current reality of bringing data-driven value to the world. </p>
<p>My hope is that this series of posts will provide a realistic perspective on what it takes to do ML in the wild.</p>
<p>Note, while I will describe in full-detail our solution to the problem, this is only <em>a</em> solution not <em>the</em> solution. Building machine learning projects, like all engineering work, entails a series of tradeoffs and design decisions, but I think there is value in showing a valid sequence through the full machine learning lifecycle even if your exact steps may differ.</p>
<h2>Defining Your Machine Learning Problem</h2>
<p>Arguably the most important step in creating a machine learning application is the problem definition. This means both determining what problem you want your application to solve (the value add) as Ill as how you will measure success (your metrics). </p>
<p>Given that this is an election year where many people across the US will be looking to form their opinion about candidates through various internet outlets, for the purposes of this project, I will tackle the problem of <strong>fake news detection</strong>. In the modern day, fake statements are more prevalent and are able to spread more virally than ever before.</p>
<p>To help alleviate this problem, I will want to build an application that can assess the truthfulness of statements made by either political speakers or social media posts. </p>
<p>Once completed, I would ideally like to deploy our project as a web browser extension that can be run in realtime on statements that users are reading on their pages. </p>
<p>As far as metrics is concerned, if our tool can automatically detect whether a statement is true or false on a random web page with <strong>at least 50%</strong> accuracy, then I will consider our project a success. Typically success if measured by some sort of business metric, but since I don’t have a formal metrics like that, this (somewhat arbitrary) threshold for accuracy will suffice. </p>
<h2>Organizing Your Repository and Tooling</h2>
<p>Now that I have our product goal and metrics defined, let’s describe how I will organize our application code repository. I’m choosing to spend some time talking about this because there is not a clear consensus in the community on best practices for organizing machine learning projects. </p>
<p>This makes it very difficult to quickly look at new projects and understand how the separation of concerns is defined, making collaboration and iteration sloIr. </p>
<p>As a counterpoint, consider the convention around how Java projects are structured. Because of a community agreed-upon consensus, any Java programmer can jump into a new codebase and immediately know where to find what. </p>
<p>In lieu of a common convention, I will describe practices for organizing machine learning projects, born out of my experience with various projects over the years. The full source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mihail911/fake-news">this repository</a>. </p>
<p>At the top-level, our repository will be structured as follows:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>fake-news/
    assets/
    config/
    data/
        raw/
        processed/
    deploy/
    fake_news/
        model/
        utils/
    model_checkpoints/
    notebooks/
    scripts/
    tests/
    LICENSE
    README.md
    requirements.txt</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Here is what each each item is responsible for:</p>
<p><strong>assets</strong>: This will store any images, plots, and other non-source files generated throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>config</strong>: I will include any configuration files needed for model training and evaluation here. </p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: This will store our fake news data in both its raw (untouched from the original source) and processed (featurized or updated for our usecase) form.</p>
<p><strong>deploy</strong>: This will store any files needed for our deployment including Dockerfiles, etc.</p>
<p><strong>fake_news</strong>: This will store all the source for building, training, and evaluating our models.</p>
<p><strong>model_checkpoints</strong>: This will store the model binaries that I train and eventually want to deploy. </p>
<p><strong>notebooks</strong>: This will store any Jupyter notebooks used for any data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>scripts</strong>: This will store any one-off scripts for generating model artifacts, setting up application environments, or processing the data.</p>
<p><strong>tests</strong>: Here I will include any unit tests, integration tests, and data tests to ensure the correctness of our system.  </p>
<p><strong>LICENSE</strong>: Our software license.</p>
<p><strong>README.md</strong>: A high-level description of our project.</p>
<p><strong>requirements.txt</strong>: This will store the code dependencies for our project. This is a standard practice for Python-based projects, which our application will be.</p>
<p>For now our requirements.txt is pretty simple, but I will highlight two dependencies that I will certainly need: <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> (a library I will use for our code testing) and <a href="https://dvc.org/">dvc</a> (a tool I will use for data and train pipeline versioning). </p>
<p>I will also be using an <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">Anaconda environment</a> to isolate our project dependencies, so they do not interfere with our local system-level dependencies. Dependency isolation is a generally good practice when building new applications, as they not only ensure clean working environments but they make it easier to quickly move and recreate applications on different host servers.</p>
<p>And with that organization completed, we are ready to move on to the <a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/performing-exploratory-data-analysis/">next step</a> of getting our dataset and doing some exploratory data analysis. </p></div></div>]]>

        <h3>
          API Key 
        </h3>
        <p>
          To generate emissions estimates from the Carbon Interface API, you need your API key. To get an API key, <a href="https://www.carboninterface.com/users/sign_up">create a Carbon Interface account</a> and copy your API key from the <a href="https://www.carboninterface.com/account/api_credentials">API Key</a> section of your account into the authentication steps detailed below.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Testing your API Key 
        </h3>
        <p>To test your API key, make a request to the <strong>/auth</strong> endpoint. Make sure to use Bearer authentication and replace <strong>API_KEY</strong> with the API key you copied from your account.</p>
<pre><code>curl "https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/auth"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY"
</code></pre>
        <p>If you receive a <strong>"message": "auth successful"</strong> response then your API key is valid and you can move forward with your integration. If you don't receive a <strong>"message": "auth successful"</strong> response, go back into your <a href="https://www.carboninterface.com/account/api_credentials">Carbon Interface account</a> and ensure you are copying and pasting your API key correctly.</p>
        
        <h2>
          Generating an estimate
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Selecting your country and state
        </h3>
        <p>To generate an electricity emissions estimate you need to specify the region that you want an electricity emissions estimate from. Every region that Carbon Interface has emissions data on (US States and Canadian Provinces) emit different levels of emissions to generate electricty. Enter the two character <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/format.html">state</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm">country</a> codes in the <strong>country</strong> and <strong>state</strong> attributes in your POST request.</p>
        <p>In this example, we want to obtain an electricity generation emissions estimate for generating electricity in the US state of Florida. We are setting the <strong>country</strong> attribute to <strong>us</strong> and the <strong>state</strong> attribute to <strong>fl</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>"country": "us",
"state": "fl"
</code></pre>
        
        <h3>
          Selecting your electricity inputs
        </h3>
        <p>To complete the body of the POST request to generate an electricity emissions estimate you need to specify the amount of electricity consumed and the unit. By defailt, <strong>electricity_unit</strong> is set to <strong>kwh</strong>. However, if you'd prefer to use <strong>mwh</strong> you can set that as the value of <strong>electricity_unit</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>"electricity_value": 42,
"electricity_unit": "mwh"
</code></pre>
        
        <h3>
          Making your request
        </h3>
        <p>With all the paramteres of our POST request set, we're ready to generate our emissions estimate! The request needs to be made to <strong>https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/estimates</strong> in order to receive a response.</p>
<pre><code>curl "https://www.carboninterface.com/api/v1/estimates"
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-X POST
-d {
      "type": "electricity",
      "electricity_unit": "mwh",
      "electricty_value": 42,
      "country": "us",
      "state": "fl"
    }
</code></pre>
        
        <h3>
          Handling the response
        </h3>
        <p>When you make a successful request to the estimates API you will receive a JSON response that includes the following:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "id": "2d968fce-859d-4dc1-9489-987e795f42bb",
    "type": "estimate",
    "attributes": {
      "country": "us",
      "state": "fl",
      "electricity_unit": "mwh",
      "electricity_value": "42.0",
      "estimated_at": "2020-07-24T02:23:24.441Z",
      "carbon_g": 18051428,
      "carbon_lb": 39796,
      "carbon_kg": 18051,
      "carbon_mt": 18
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The response will include all of the original parameters that were sent in the request, in addition to <strong>id</strong>, <strong>estimated_at</strong>, <strong>carbon_g</strong>, <strong>carbon_lb</strong>, <strong>carbon_kg</strong> and <strong>carbon_mt</strong> that are all nested under the <strong>attributes</strong> key.</p>
        <p>Now you can use the data in the response to display the emissions estimate to your users or include in other calculations.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong>Food</strong><br> A common thing that can bring even the most opposite parts of the world together to enjoy and celebrate each other’s wonderful cultures. With that being said, it is only right that the tech world uses food to bring those interested in technology, together to learn more and more. Ranging from bytes, cookies, spam, and apple; tech continues to provide “nourishment” or knowledge to those looking to devour it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>So to begin, we are going to dive into the layers of our burrito and understand more about the OSI Layer Model. What is it you might be wondering? Well, the model represents a hierarchy of how the inner workings of a computer communicates with one another. The layers within the CPU provides users with a delicious taste as well as functionality for the system holistically.</p> 
<p>Next, let’s get into the ingredients of our TECH BURRITO!.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 1</strong><br> Tortilla also known as the PHYSICAL LAYER for which the burrito begins. As the name implies, this layer consists of the hardware components of a system or a network. This includes voltage levels, cable types, CPU, the wires etc. It is the tortilla that helps keep everything together, and if it gets cut or even broken, well, the entire burrito is going to collapse into a mush of toppings. The best way to limit things such as power outages that may harm business operations, thus breaking that “tortilla” there is a need to have redundancy for all critical hardware so that way if one fails, there is something in place to keep the inner parts running together smoothly.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 2</strong><br> Beans also known as the DATA LAYER. Whether you like black or pinto beans, they add texture and warmth that sets the tone for your burrito to welcome the next toppings you select. Similarly, data links function in the same manner. Each device is given a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address. These addresses ensure that communicating devices are effective in transporting the information to and from one another correctly. The MAC filtering method is also used to create a list that either permits access (whitelisted) or denies access (blacklisted), keeping your information safe and secure or keeping your toppings from getting to the physical, vulnerable layer.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 3</strong><br> Vegetables also known as the NETWORK LAYER. Yes people, eat your leafy greens and understand that vegetables or the network layer is very important. The network layers function is to transfer/route variable lengths of data sequences called datagrams from source to destination, a.k.a. packet forwarding. The layer responds to requests from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer. The most common protocols used are either IPv4 and IPv6. In this layer there are multiple security protocols in place such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec protocols are implemented to ensure there is a mutual authentication from host to host, host to network, and network to network. Much like our vegetables, the network layer protocols provide a sense of security to the other areas within the physical and data layers.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 4</strong><br> Chicken, beef, chorizo, fish or tofu also known as the TRANSPORT LAYER.- Is the most important ingredient in a burrito, especially this one. Whatever your preference of meat, it provides nourishment for our bodies, and the same can be said for this burrito in regards to CPU’s. The transport layer is the dividing line between upper layers and lower layers of the model. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used to establish and confirm there is connection between the host and/or host/network being connected.</p> 
<p>Once a connection is confirmed, a tunnel is formed for transporting data segments. Acknowledgments are sent from the opposite side for each data received. If a data segment is lost, there is a detection that takes place so then that segment is resent. User Datagram Program (UDP) is used in the same manner except UDP doesn’t have the checking system that is used in TCP and its main purpose is just to be fast. Transport layer security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communications over a network, so like mentioned all of this is important as it connects every aspect of the burrito to the other areas.</p> 
<p>And alas, we come to the final ingredients. The pico de gallo, cheese, and guacamole.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 5</strong><br> Pico de gallo also known as the SESSION LAYER. This layer controls the dialogue between different computers. It establishes, manages, and even terminates those connections. Specifically, its sole purpose is to make sure sessions are gracefully closed, and session support such as login authentication is completed as well. Much like pico de gallo, this is plain to see and important as it adds yet another aspect to our burrito.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 6</strong><br> Queso or cheese also known as the PRESENTATION LAYER. The presentation layer is responsible for data formatting and translation. This data is translated and used for the application layer. Character translation, data conversion, compression, and encryption occur at this level. Best examples of this include changing the language into english and the asterisks we see when we enter passwords. While some may have to add cheese sparingly (sorry my lactose friends), it is evident that in this burrito we need all the cheese we can get to ensure we are able to access our information.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 7</strong><br> Guacamole also known as the APPLICATION LAYER. This layer, much like guacamole, adds a delicious taste and is used in EVERYTHING. Every application we use whether it’s Chrome, Firefox, Gmail, etc. is at this layer. In lack of better words, it’s the windows into the tech world for users and the networks. To maintain security at this level, an antivirus software does fine (at the minimum of course).</p> 
<p>While this is only a short overview of the OSI model, it is important to note that implementation of security at these levels is essential to everyday technology. The physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers are all needed for a network/system to function. The OSI model may literally lack the delicious flavors of a burrito, it does fit well within the tech kitchen of ingredients and recipes needed to continue creating, revising, and implementing features for everyday users to enjoy.</p> 
<p>Bon Appetit!</p>

        <p>I was looking for a way to monitor USB drives and trigger a backup when I plug in my backup drive.
Most solutions online describe a way to do it in C# or C++, but I wanted to write one in Python.</p>
<p><a href="#alternative-approach-polling-for-drives">My first naive attempt</a> was to get the list of drives, and poll for changes every couple of seconds. I've explained this method below and it works fine.</p>
<p>However I wasn't really comfortable with launching a subprocess every second. It seemed wasteful.
So I've written a second method that uses Win32 APIs to hook into Windows and monitor drive changes.</p>
<div>
<p>If you're interested, I have <a href="https://abdus.dev/posts/monitor-clipboard/">another post</a> where I build a clipboard listener that you can use to monitor clipboard contents.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="getting-a-list-of-drives">Getting a list of drives</h2>
<p>Windows provides an interface for sysadmins called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Management Instrumentation</a> (WMI) which basically allows you to monitor a local or remote system.</p>
<p>On PowerShell we can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Get-WmiObject</code></a> command to interact with it.
WMI <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-logicaldisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Win32_LogicalDisk</code></a> class gives us a list of the drives currently connected to the PC.</p>
<pre data-lang="powershell"><code><span>PS</span> &gt; <span>Get-WmiObject</span> <span>-Class</span> Win32_LogicalDisk

<p>That's a lot of useful information 👌. We can use <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/inventory-drive-types-by-using-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>DriveType</code></a> to determine if a drive is removable or not.</p>
<div>

<p>Finally, we can pick the fields we need and convert the command result to JSON so that Python can easily parse it.</p>
<pre data-lang="powershell"><code><span>PS</span> &gt; <span>Get-WmiObject</span> <span>-Class</span> Win32_LogicalDisk | <span>Select-Object</span> deviceid,volumename,drivetype | <span>ConvertTo-Json</span>

<pre data-lang="json"><code>[
  {
    <span>"DeviceID"</span>: <span>"C:"</span>,

  },
  {
    <span>"DeviceID"</span>: <span>"E:"</span>,
    <span>"VolumeName"</span>: <span>"ABDUS"</span>,
    <span>"DriveType"</span>: <span>2</span>
  },
  ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can call this PowerShell command from Python using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>subprocess</code></a> module and parse its JSON output:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code><span>from</span> dataclasses <span>import</span> dataclass

<p>which outputs</p>
<pre data-lang="text"><code>[Drive(letter='C:', label='', drive_type='Local Disk'), ...]
</code></pre>
<p>OK. Now the difficult part: hooking it up to Windows.</p>
<h2 id="listening-to-windows-wm_devicechange-messages">Listening to Windows <code>WM_DEVICECHANGE</code> messages</h2>
<p>Windows uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/window-messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messages</a> to notify programs of events and let them react. This includes user inputs (mouse clicks, key strokes etc.) and other OS events (hardware connected, low power, A/C adapter connected etc.).</p>
<p>Windows broadcasts a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/wm-devicechange#parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>WM_DEVICECHANGE</code> message</a> when hardware configuration of the system changes. That includes plug-and-play devices, such as USB drives, printers, mouse etc. We need a way to listen to this broadcast. That requires creating a window, registering a window procedure, then running a message loop that receives messages from the operating system.</p>
<p>We need the <a href="https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>pywin32</code></a> package, which provides extensions to consume Win32 APIs in Python. We can install it with pip:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell"><code>pip install pywin32
</code></pre>
<p>To create a window, we can follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/creating-a-window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's docs</a> and translate the given C++ example to its Python equivalent.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code><span data-line="1"><span>import</span> win32api, win32con, win32gui</span>
<span data-line="2"></span>
<span data-line="3"><span><span>def</span> <span>create_window</span>() -&gt; int:</span></span>

<span data-line="14">    wc.lpszClassName = <span>'Demo'</span></span>
<span data-line="15">    wc.hInstance = win32api.GetModuleHandle(<span>None</span>)</span>
<span data-line="16">    class_atom = win32gui.RegisterClass(wc)</span>
<span data-line="17">    <span>return</span> win32gui.CreateWindow(class_atom, <span>'Demo'</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, wc.hInstance, <span>None</span>)</span>
<span data-line="18"></span>
<span data-line="19"><span>if</span> __name__ == <span>'__main__'</span>:</span>
<span data-line="20">    create_window()</span>
<span data-line="21">    win32gui.PumpMessages()</span>
<span data-line="22"></span></code></pre>
<p>The highlighted line is the critical part. It is our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/using-window-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"window procedure"</a> that gets called when the window receives a message.
It must have the following signature:</p>
<pre data-lang="c++"><code><span>LRESULT CALLBACK <span>MainWndProc</span><span>(
    HWND hwnd,        
    UINT uMsg,        
    WPARAM wParam,    
    LPARAM lParam)</span>    
</span>{ ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Python's <code>print</code> function accepts an arbitrary number of parameters and dumps all its arguments to console, so its signature is compatible.</p>
<p>Once we run this script we can see the messages received by our window:</p>
<pre data-lang="text"><code>789538 537 7 0
789538 537 32772 346174713248
...
</code></pre>
<p>All these integers are either a value or a pointer to a value. Let's break down the second message:</p>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Hexadecimal</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>hwnd</code></td>
<td><code>789538</code></td>
<td><code>0xc0c22</code></td>
<td>our window's handle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>msg</code></td>
<td><code>537</code></td>
<td><code>0x0219</code></td>
<td><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/wm-devicechange#parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>WM_DEVICECHANGE</code></a> message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>wparam</code></td>
<td><code>32772</code></td>
<td><code>0x8004</code></td>
<td><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/dbt-deviceremovecomplete" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>DBT_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE</code></a> event</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>lparam</code></td>
<td><code>346174713248</code></td>
<td><code>0x50999eeda0</code></td>
<td>pointer (memory address) to event info</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Once we decipher the message type, we can google its hexadecimal value to find which message it corresponds to, then figure out what it contains. Here we don't really need to dereference and unpack <code>lparam</code> pointer, because <a href="#getting-a-list-of-drives">we're using WMI</a> for that. We just need to know something has happened.</p>
<p><code>WM_DEVICECHANGE</code> message gives us <code>DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL</code> and <code>DBT_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE</code> events to notify when a device is added or removed respectively.</p>
<p>Now putting these all together:</p>
<h2 id="python-script">Python script</h2>
<p>I wrapped the code I've explained above inside <code>DeviceListener</code> class. It provides an easy way to attach your own listener and perform a task when a drive is attached/removed.</p>
<p>It assumes the script will be run as the main script, that's why <code>DeviceListener.start()</code> is blocking. You can run it inside a thread if you want it to be non-blocking.</p>
<p>You can also change the highlighted line to trigger the callback only when a drive is either inserted or removed.</p>

Over the past ten years, he has gained quite a record in fuzzing browsers. His primary focus is to ensure the security of Mozilla Firefox. He is one of the leading experts in Grammar-Based Fuzzing. As a team lead, Christian is well-acquainted with the human components in automated bug finding. </span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span>Psychological effects, emotions and group dynamics play a crucial role in software development, especially when it comes to automated fuzz testing. In this article, Christian points out these phenomena and shows us how to make development and security teams work together.</span></p>

<hr>

<h2>You Will Need Trust and Empathy</h2>
<p>During my nearly ten years at Mozilla, I often found myself somewhere between the security testing team and the development teams. Throughout this time, I was able to learn many valuable lessons. One of the biggest challenges I have faced, was establishing trust between those two parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By nature, the relationship between development and security teams is often prone to bad blood. But with empathy and appreciation, you can bring them together to work as a unit. In this article, I want to share my experiences to help you improve this relationship.</p>

<h2>Large-Scale Software Development Is More Challenging Than It Seems</h2>
<p>Developing a piece of software as complex as a web browser is far more complicated than many people think. Internet browsers such as Firefox consist of over<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/code-quality-tools-at-mozilla/"><span> 21 million lines of code</span></a>. Firefox has several hundreds of authors and around 2000 commits per month. The browser can be divided into several components that provide various features, e.g. rendering of HTML, CSS or SVG, but also multiple media support and a highly optimized JavaScript engine, just to name a few.</p>

<h2>Complexity Requires Specialization</h2>
<p>For each of these components, there is at least one specialized team. Their <em>domain knowledge</em> allows them to better understand the code architecture and they are more familiar with the contracts between the different modules. As a result, each team knows their code’s expected behavior and potential weaknesses best.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each of the individual browser components requires a thorough security testing strategy. Fuzzing is a highly effective way to achieve this. However, to perform well, fuzzing requires each team’s domain knowledge. This is just one reason why the traditional "lone-warrior fuzzing" approach is no longer sufficient in this scenario. What we need instead is a mutual trust relationship.</p>

<h2>No More Fuzzing Ninja-Style&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There is a need for a positive working relationship between the development and the security testing team. This observation does not only apply to our case at Mozilla - It is a problem that concerns managers and tech-leads in many industries.</p>
<p>So, please avoid fuzzing ninja-style. Don’t build a fuzzer on your own and in secret just to rapid-fire bugs at your development team. This approach is outdated. It might help you feel superior for a while, but not only will it deteriorate the relationship between you and your fellow developers, it is also the least effective way to build a fuzzer. If you can get your developers’ help, <strong>together </strong>you will achieve much more.</p>

<h2>Don’t Assume Equal Priorities</h2>
<p>Development teams often suffer from a lack of resources. Dumping a massive load of bugs on their desk can lead to defensive behavior. Developers will feel overwhelmed and perceive these bugs as “extra work” caused by you and your security team. Merely digging up errors in a project that someone else put diligence and effort into can create a lot of tension.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-c1Xctutp2bUdVrc-GXDXl9UFG0lH6jh19cfPDU96u359wTDJZcOr9GmveOs16L6Jqw-QXD9-L_qZNwjdNsVR9WHoGbnMD1MxeMLQcaQLlv_9algqwfsWDcxHxJIgBNBiQc2Apq" width="406" alt="Dont dump bugs at dev desk"></p>

<p>Don’t show off your findings. Instead, try to understand the developer perspective. They might have a different set of priorities than you. It is crucial for a healthy relationship between security teams and development, that both teams are involved in the testing process. This will also help the development team comprehend your findings better.</p>

<div>
<h3>Code Ownership Bias</h3>
<p>Code Ownership Bias, Initially known as “property oriented programming” (Weinberg, The psychology of computer programming), describes a phenomenon, where developers form an emotional attachment to their code. When other people start testing the code for bugs, developers might interpret it as a threat. Code Ownership Bias can often cause developers to exhibit defensive behaviour when security measures are introduced.</p>
</div>
<h2><br>Talk to Each Other</h2>
<p>To avoid defensive behavior, share previous success stories with the developers. These examples will help them understand your motivation and priorities. Also, make sure to offer your helping hand and show genuine interest in their projects. A relationship is always based on reciprocity. If you communicate more, you might find some valuable hints on where to search for vulnerabilities and errors. This might save your security team a lot of time. It will also help developers understand that your work will help them overall.</p>
<p>Another aspect here is expectations: It is not uncommon for development teams to expect things from fuzzing that fuzzing cannot deliver and the other way around. To avoid conflicts later on, make sure you define goals together and educate each other on requirements early on.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vUVjvrSZ7xl66RYCYAXI6TIFRZxAnfG4e1-Im9IGaNJiwiPo0usrCALUj659vcYGATVbA_LUB1qD1x0CeElbPbmLhoilwiQAUNCCAlsiP7Uz2wax10ugGzL0jf00AnvoS4VAg80C" width="624" height="351" alt="Requirements and Goals"></p>

<h2>Fuzz Blockers: First Impressions Matter</h2>
<p>A fuzz blocker is a bug that is disruptive to your fuzzing operations. Usually, it is a highly frequent bug that consumes many fuzzing resources. At the same time, it is hard to avoid or work around. Therefore, such bugs are of the highest priority for the security team. However, developers usually see fuzz blockers as low-priority bugs. And they are right, since they generally have little to no impact on the usability of an application. Here we have a prime example for very different priorities. It becomes even more critical if you consider that fuzz blockers often occur at the beginning of a testing process. Especially if there is no trust relationship established yet, dealing with this situation properly is vital: If the fuzzing team’s first response after deploying fuzzing is just fuzz blockers, some developers might think that fuzzing will only find “unimportant” bugs. This can ruin the first impression. Educate your developers about this phenomenon!</p>

<h2>Write the First Fix Yourself!</h2>
<p>Instead of feeding fuzz blockers back to the developers right away, I recommend writing the first fix yourself. This way, you will learn something about the project at hand. Being familiar with the codebase is especially useful if you are planning to implement continuous fuzzing on it. You will also learn more about the code’s development and debugging requirements. This might help you improve the bug-fixing process for fuzz bugs in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, If you manage to fix all the fuzz blockers locally, you can continue fuzzing faster. If you share your patch with the developers, ask them to look over it. They will surely appreciate your effort, even if the patch is not perfect.</p>

<h2>Start Fuzzing as Early as Possible</h2>
<p>Implementing fuzzing in a late stage of the development lifecycle can have a devastating psychological effect. Developers often spend months or even years on a release. Starting with fuzz testing right before production is the worst way to do it. Coming out of the blue and shooting 20 bugs back at the developers after such a long development time can be very discouraging.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png" alt="Start fuzzing early" width="482" srcset="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=241&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 241w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 482w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=723&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 723w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=964&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 964w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1205&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1205w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1446&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"></p>

<p>To avoid this, you should start fuzz testing as soon as the project is ready for it. But when is a project ready? Again, it is imperative for you to communicate with developers on this. Sometimes, very early versions of a project have too many known issues, and fuzzing would not contribute much. In general, fuzzing should start at the earliest version that developers consider stable enough for testing. This will ensure you catch bugs early on and give your team some time to resolve issues around fuzzing, while driving up its effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Watch Out for Experimental Features</h2>
<p>Sometimes it can even be helpful to fuzz experimental features. But again, you should consult with the developers first. Developers usually implement experimental features behind switches for a reason. At this stage, they are probably already aware of some bugs and vulnerabilities. Pointing them out by turning on switches without further consultation is usually not too well received.</p>

<h2>Become a Teacher</h2>
<p>Try to make the security testing process transparent to the developers. Provide them with insights on how fuzzing actually works and regularly share updates on progress, e.g. through code coverage. Make the use of required tools (e.g. to reproduce your bugs) as easy as possible for developers. Also, make sure they understand your intentions and ask them if they have everything they need to comprehend what you are doing. In the end, educating them will help you implement early-stage security testing practices</p>

<p><em>“At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.” </em></p>
<p>– Christian Holler</p>
<h2>Fuzzing Is Teamwork!</h2>
<p>This last point sums up the essence of this entire article. Security teams should involve developers in their testing processes from start to finish. As a company, you can achieve so much more if your teams work together instead of against each other. At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Writing tests today sucks. Tests are expensive to write. They're even more
expensive to maintain. They're somewhat opaque to anybody who's not intimately
familiar with the test harness. You can't always be sure whether you're writing
the “right” tests for your situation. Worst of all, it's sometimes difficult to
persuade a non-technical stakeholder that software testing actually does
anything underneath the hood, except maybe inflate operational expenses for your
software budget. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941">Every software development horror
story</a> I've heard comes with some
discussion around tests, and that's because not only does software fail in more
ways than anybody without job security may care to admit, it fails in novel and
unpredictable manners.</p>
<p>What sucks even more is <em>just how important effective software testing is</em> for
software engineers to quickly and confidently contribute value. The absolute
first thing I do after cloning most <code>git</code> repositories these days, for work or
otherwise, is run the test suite. Test suites are self-documenting and always
more accurate than a wiki or other forms of documentation, and since they're
programmatic it's much easier to tie into the rest of your developer workflow
(say when setting up automated deployments to production).</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, this probably isn't news to you if you've been working in industry for
a while, and it's easy to fall into a trap of powerlessness and believing any
endemic lack of alignment is eternal. And while it's not always (and usually
not) the fault of technical limitations, it may be useful to think of technical
ways to grow beyond the immediate problem. So I'd like to say there are two
great aspects about professional software that could be applied to software
testing.</p>
<p>The first is we're usually using paradigms that are decades old. Professional
software is usually incremental in action and incrementalist in thinking. This
implies there's often new concepts in academia or research that might solve
current problems. One professor I talked to around graduation 4 years ago
brought up how the A* path-finding algorithm was invented 20 years before its
adoption in the video game industry (and apparently that's at least one reason
why NPCs don't collide with in-world walls anymore).</p>
<p>The second is test suites usually under the full control of engineering. There
might be a QA department within engineering, but I have yet to see a
sales/marketing department care deeply about how you structure a test harness,
vs. the layout of a landing page. While serving the company is the goal of any
business-oriented engineering department, this means there's more agency than
usual in how engineering approaches testing, than say product implementation or
devops.</p>
<p>What we're looking for as software engineers is to write as many good tests as
possible within some limited time frame.</p>
<h2 id="different-software-testing-strategies-ive-used">Different software testing strategies I've used</h2>
<p>The most important thing about writing good tests is to start writing good
source code and develop good habits. This might involve separating concerns in a
codebase by using functions instead of classes, gradually applying type
signatures using <code>mypy</code> or <code>pyre-check</code> and adding a typechecking step to your
CI pipeline, and paying attention to software properties like immutability
(updating an object creates a copy of the object with the update instead of
mutating the original object) and idempotency (running a code block generates
the same output for the same input even for multiple runs). You can bring a lot
of value to the table by using tools + infrastructure like <code>black</code> for
autoformatting and Docker / <code>docker-compose</code> for running local infrastructure,
and a lot of this undergirds higher-order testing strategies like property-based
testing later on.</p>
<p>Some of these strategies I've applied in the field revolve around these simpler
ideas. When I'm building a webapp frontend or backend, I adopted the idea of
“functional core, imperative shell”, where you have a soup of decoupled methods
within your app that are easily unit testable, and a set of well-defined I/O
interfaces and stubs to imperative resources like your network or database to
create the cheapest possible integration tests. This is nice for stateless,
pass-through entities, but works less well when you're primarily looking for
effects (e.g. it'd be very difficult to unit test most of PostgreSQL
effectively). So when I became a data engineer, and I spent most of my day
interacting with effectful systems, I attempted with some success to write a set
of <a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2018/11/07/data_driven_testing">data-driven integration tests using
<code>pytest</code></a> and leverage its ability to
parameterize over fixtures using data to create essentially a mongodump of test
descriptions. This solution was nice since it allowed me to scale the amount of
data I tested far beyond the amount of code I needed to write. However, I still
needed to come up with my own oracle values to test with. It's easy to run an
expensive integration test with very little added value.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in property-based testing stems from. I'd also mention
that even with property-based testing, all these testing strategies (and others
I haven't covered or discovered yet) have their place and their tradeoffs. You
should decide for yourself when to apply or to not apply each.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-property-based-testing">What is property-based testing?</h2>
<p>At its simplest, property-based testing is the inverse of normal unit testing.
Instead of providing some amount of data and a transformation so the computer
can assert a property, you provide a property and a transformation, so the
computer can provide some data.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the basics. Say you defined a method <code>addOne()</code> to increment an
integer by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>addOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test method <code>addOne()</code>, you can define a set of unit tests:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>():
    <span>assert</span> addOne(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>6</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can even parameterize a list of oracle inputs and expected values:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> pytest

<span>@pytest.mark.parametrize</span>(<span></span><span>'</span><span>_input, _expected</span><span>'</span>, [(<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>), (<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>), (<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>)])
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input, _expected):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _expected
</code></pre></div><p>The final leap is realizing that instead of coming up with your own oracle
values, you just care that the inputs are integers and the outputs are a
functional, deterministic transform resulting in an integer output. This is
where property-based testing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st

<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _input <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some properties, you can define and apply the opposite transform, which when
combined with the original transform, generates the identity function, which
should then leave the input untouched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>subOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

<span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st
<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addsub_returns_value</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> subOne(addOne(_input)) <span>==</span> _input
</code></pre></div><p>So what else is it similar to / different from? One's <em>generative testing</em>,
which are tests that create tests. Since we're creating a spec here,
<code>hypothesis</code> is generating tests underneath the hood for us and running them.
Otherwise, property-based testing is a bit different as it supports intelligent
search strategies that allow us to shrink the error space.</p>
<p>Another testing paradigm similar to property-based testing is <em>fuzz testing</em>,
where random inputs are inserted into a program to see how it behaves and
whether it crashes. To me, fuzz testing is more an extension of black-box
integration testing, and extends more into devops or security related testing,
rather than the unit-focused nature of property-based testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hypothesis">What is <code>hypothesis</code>?</h2>
<p><code>hypothesis</code> is one of the more popular implementations of property-based
testing in Python. I had thought it originated from a PBT library called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck"><strong><code>QuickCheck</code></strong></a> in Haskell,
but after reading through a Haskell book earlier this year and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ovebeq/pythonista_s_review_haskell#c_gz09vc">talking to some
folks online</a>,
there's a more “intelligent” PBT library in Haskell it came from called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog"><strong><code>Hedgehog</code></strong></a>, which applies
built-in shrinking as part of the test generation suite.</p>
<p>You can find the <code>hypothesis</code> for Python documentation
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>, and additional
documentation around the team behind Hypothesis
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-strategies"><code>hypothesis</code> strategies</h3>
<p>The key idea behind <code>hypothesis</code> is strategy generation. You can see examples of
it by running this code segment in your <code>python</code> terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> strategies <span>as</span> st

st<span>.</span>text()<span>.</span>example()
</code></pre></div><p><code>hypothesis</code> supports basic strategies like those targeting Python's “primitive”
types. You can create <code>st.integers()</code> or <code>st.text()</code>. You can also do more
advanced things, like create strategies from structs like dictionaries or lists,
combine strategies together, infer strategies from a regular expression, and
build strategies from well-recognized third-party classes from <code>pandas</code> or
Django.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-tactics"><code>hypothesis</code> tactics</h3>
<p>I took a lot of these tactics from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">a talk by Zac Hatfield-Dodds introducing PBT
at PyCon US</a>. Check out his website
<a href="https://zhd.dev/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The types of properties you can apply with <code>hypothesis</code> allow for certain
tactics you can play with in <code>hypothesis</code>.</p>
<p>One of these tactics might be manually defining the property, then letting
<code>hypothesis</code> generate the test cases for you. One common way this tactic is
applied is to look for “round-trip” properties, where you look for the inverse
method and check that applying both would result in the identity method.</p>
<p>Another tactic might be to use an oracle function. This can be really helpful if
you're refactoring a piece of code and you want to carry forward the original
behavior of that method, regardless of whether it's correct or incorrect. In
this case, that method becomes an oracle and you can apply the equal-by-value
constraint between the original and refactored methods as a …</p></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>One of the concerns I’ve seen aimed at Bitcoin is the claim that it’s a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme. The argument suggests that because the Bitcoin network is contin­u­ally reliant on new people buying in, that eventu­ally it will collapse in price as new buyers are exhausted.</p>



<p>So, this article takes a&nbsp;serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like charac­ter­is­tics, to see if the claim holds&nbsp;up.</p>



<p>The short version is that Bitcoin does not meet the defin­i­tion of a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme in either narrow or broad scope, but let’s dive in to see why that’s the&nbsp;case.</p>







<h2><strong>Defining a&nbsp;Ponzi Scheme</strong></h2>



<p>To start with tackling the topic of Bitcoin as a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme, we need a&nbsp;definition.</p>



<p>Here is how the <a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme">US Securi­ties and Exchange Commis­sion defines one</a>:</p>



<p><em>“A Ponzi scheme is an invest­ment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk. But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraud­sters do not invest the money. Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves.</em></p>



<p><em>With little or no legit­i­mate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a&nbsp;constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes tend to collapse.</em></p>



<p><em>Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who duped investors in the 1920s with a&nbsp;postage stamp specu­la­tion&nbsp;scheme.”</em></p>



<p>They further go on to list red flags to look out&nbsp;for:</p>



<p><em>“Many Ponzi schemes share common charac­ter­is­tics. Look for these warning&nbsp;signs:</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High returns with little or no risk.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Every invest­ment carries some degree of risk, and invest­ments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspi­cious of any “guaran­teed” invest­ment opportunity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Overly consis­tent returns.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Invest­ments tend to go up and down over time. Be skeptical about an invest­ment that regularly gener­ates positive returns regard­less of overall market conditions.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Unreg­is­tered invest­ments.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Ponzi schemes typically involve invest­ments that are not regis­tered with the SEC or with state regula­tors. Regis­tra­tion is impor­tant because it provides investors with access to infor­ma­tion about the company’s manage­ment, products, services, and finances.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Unlicensed sellers.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Federal and state securi­ties laws require invest­ment profes­sionals and firms to be licensed or regis­tered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individ­uals or unreg­is­tered&nbsp;firms.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Secre­tive, complex strate­gies.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Avoid invest­ments if you don’t under­stand them or can’t get complete infor­ma­tion about&nbsp;them.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Issues with paper­work.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Account state­ment errors may be a&nbsp;sign that funds are not being invested as promised.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Diffi­culty receiving payments.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Be suspi­cious if you don’t receive a&nbsp;payment or have diffi­culty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent partic­i­pants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying&nbsp;put.”</em></p>



<p>I think that’s a&nbsp;great set of infor­ma­tion to work with. We can see how many of those attrib­utes, if any, Bitcoin&nbsp;has.</p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin’s Launch&nbsp;Process</strong></h2>



<p>Before we get into comparing Bitcoin point-by-point to the above list, we can start with a&nbsp;recap of how Bitcoin was launched.</p>



<p>In August 2008, someone identi­fying himself as Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin.org.</p>



<p>Two months later in October 2008, Satoshi released the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. This document explained how the technology would work, including the solution to the double-spending problem. As you can see from the link, it was written in the format and style of an academic research paper, since it was presenting a&nbsp;major technical break­through that provided a&nbsp;solution for well-known computer science challenges related to digital scarcity. It contained no promises of enrich­ment or&nbsp;returns.</p>



<p>Then, three months later in January 2009, Satoshi published the initial Bitcoin software. In the custom genesis block of the blockchain, which contains no spend­able Bitcoin, he provided a&nbsp;time-stamped article headline about bank bailouts from The Times of London, likely to prove that there was no pre-mining and to set the tone for the project. From there, it took him six days to finish things and mine block 1, which contained the first 50 spend­able bitcoins, and he released the Bitcoin source code that day on January 9<sup>th</sup>. By January 10<sup>th</sup>, Hal Finney publicly tweeted that he was running the Bitcoin software as well, and right from the begin­ning, Satoshi was testing the system by sending bitcoins to&nbsp;Hal.</p>



<p>Inter­est­ingly, since Satoshi showed how to do it with the white paper more than two months before launching the open source Bitcoin software himself, techni­cally someone could have used the newfound knowl­edge to launch a&nbsp;version before him. It would have been unlikely, due to Satoshi’s big head start in figuring all of this out and under­standing it at a&nbsp;deep level, but it was techni­cally possible. He gave away the key techno­log­ical break­through before he launched the first version of the project. Between the publi­ca­tion of the white paper and the launch of the software, he answered questions and explained his choices for his white paper to several other cryptog­ra­phers on an <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/">email list</a> in response to their critiques, almost like an academic thesis defense, and several of them could have been technical enough to “steal” the project from him, if they were less skeptical.</p>



<p>After launch, a&nbsp;set of equip­ment that is widely believed to belong to Satoshi remained a&nbsp;large Bitcoin miner throughout the first year. Mining is neces­sary to keep verifying trans­ac­tions for the network, and bitcoins had no quoted dollar price at that time. He gradu­ally reduced his mining over time, as mining became more distrib­uted across the network. There are nearly 1&nbsp;million bitcoins that are believed to belong to Satoshi that he mined through Bitcoin’s early period and that he has never moved from their initial address. He could have cashed out at any point with billions of dollars in profit, but so far has not, over a&nbsp;decade into the project’s life. It’s not known if he is still alive, but other than some early coins for test trans­ac­tions, the bulk of his coins haven’t&nbsp;moved.</p>



<p>Not long after, he trans­ferred owner­ship of his website domains to others, and ever since, Bitcoin has been self-sustaining among a&nbsp;revolving devel­op­ment commu­nity with no input from&nbsp;Satoshi.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is open source, and is distrib­uted around the world. The blockchain is public, trans­parent, verifi­able, auditable, and analyz­able. Firms can do analytics of the entire blockchain and see which bitcoins are moving or remaining in place in various addresses. An open source full node can be run on a&nbsp;basic home computer, and can audit Bitcoin’s entire money supply and other&nbsp;metrics.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we can then compare Bitcoin to the red flags of being a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme.</p>



<h2><strong>Investment Returns: Not Promised</strong></h2>



<p>Satoshi never promised any invest­ment returns, let alone high invest­ment returns or consis­tent invest­ment returns. In fact, Bitcoin was known for the first decade of its existence as being an extremely high-volatility specu­la­tion. For the first year and a&nbsp;half, Bitcoin had no quotable price, and after that it had a&nbsp;very volatile price.</p>



<p>The online writings from Satoshi still exist, and he barely ever talked about finan­cial gain. He mostly wrote about technical aspects, about freedom, about the problems of the modern banking system, and so forth. Satoshi wrote mostly like a&nbsp;programmer, occasion­ally like an econo­mist, and never like a&nbsp;salesman.</p>



<p>We have to search pretty deeply to find instances where he discussed Bitcoin poten­tially becoming valuable. When he did talk about the poten­tial value or price of a&nbsp;bitcoin, he spoke very matter-of-factly in regards to how to catego­rize it, whether it would be infla­tionary or defla­tionary, and admitted a&nbsp;ton of variance for how the project could turn out. Digging around for Satoshi’s quotes on the price of value of a&nbsp;bitcoin, here’s what I&nbsp;found:</p>



<p><em>“The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a&nbsp;planned amount, but this does not neces­sarily result in infla­tion. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be defla­tion and early holders of money will see its value increase.”</em></p>



<p><em>___</em></p>



<p><em>“It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a&nbsp;self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many appli­ca­tions if you could effort­lessly pay a&nbsp;few cents to a&nbsp;website as easily as dropping coins in a&nbsp;vending machine.”</em></p>



<p><em>___</em></p>



<p><em>“In this sense, it’s more typical of a&nbsp;precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is prede­ter­mined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the poten­tial for a&nbsp;positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advan­tage of the increasing value.”</em></p>



<p><em>___</em></p>



<p><em>“Maybe it could get an initial value circu­larly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its poten­tial useful­ness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collec­tors, any random reason could spark it. I&nbsp;think the tradi­tional quali­fi­ca­tions for money were written with the assump­tion that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no …</em></p></div></div>

February 5, 2021 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-05-refinement-types/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-05-refinement-types/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This post is
about compiling refinement types into a dependently typed core language,
my project as an <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-05-fellows-announce/">Open Source
Fellow</a> for Tweag.
The post
assumes some passing familiarity with the concept of dependent types, and
little else. By reading this post, you will learn what a refinement type is,
and how we might implement a refinement type system (like <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/">Liquid
Haskell</a>) on top of a
dependently typed language (like Idris, or, more tantalizingly, what Haskell
might soon become), by translating refinement types into dependent pairs
(also called existential types or Sigma-types).
You will also get a glimpse of what an Open Source Fellow
can accomplish during their time at Tweag. Completing this
project — translating refinement types to dependent types — was the
goal of my fellowship.</p>
<h2>Introducing refinement types</h2>
<p>A refinement type (RT) is a regular type (like <code>Int</code>), endowed with some
predicate restricting the set of admissible values. As an example, <code>{ n : Int | n &gt; 5 }</code> is an RT describing the set of integers that are greater than <code>5</code>.
Refinement type systems are designed to enable machine-decidable proof
finding. A programmer can write</p>
<div data-language="idris"><pre><code>addPos : { a : Int | a &gt; 0 } -&gt; { b : Int | b &gt; 0 } -&gt; { n : Int | n &gt; a &amp; n &gt; b }
addPos a b = a + b</code></pre></div>
<p>and, if the RT system accepts this definition, be sure that its runtime
behavior is as specified: the result is greater than both inputs. This
checking can often be completed by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT
solver</a>, a
separate tool adept at proving or disproving logical statements. In this case,
the type-checker might ask the SMT solver to check whether
<code>∀ a : Int. ∀ b : Int. (a &gt; 0 ⋀ b &gt; 0) ⇒ (a + b &gt; a ⋀ a + b &gt; b)</code> holds.</p>
<p>One way to understand a refinement type <code>{ x : A | P x }</code> is to see it
as a type of pairs of a value <code>v</code> of type <code>A</code>, together with a proof of <code>P v</code>.
In a dependently typed system — where we
can encode logical predicates with ease — this construct is called a dependent
pair, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">Σ-type</a>. Note that
the predicate references the associated value; in other words, the second
component of the pair depends on the first one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/">Liquid Haskell</a> project
is about adding easy-to-use refinement types to Haskell, and its pages contain
many great examples and a way to interactively experiment with refinement types.</p>
<h2>Unifying refinement and dependent types</h2>
<p>This understanding raises a natural question: if refinement types are a subset
of dependent types, can we compile the former to the latter? Doing so would
allow us to add the ease of programming with refinement types on top of existing
dependently typed languages. Refinement type
systems can be complex and be difficult to type-check, often requiring a notion of sub-typing (because, for
example, all values of type <code>{ n : Int | n &gt; 1 }</code> are also values of type <code>{ n : Int | n &gt; 0 }</code>). Dependently typed systems, on
the other hand, do not generally have sub-typing and can be designed to be
easy to type-check.</p>
<p>In order to tackle this problem methodically, I first made the problem concrete, by writing a compiler that translates a small source language into <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a> source code.
My source language is based
on the <a href="http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/liquid_types.pdf">first paper</a>
describing liquid types (that is, decidable refinement types) for OCaml.</p>
<p>As an example, given a definition in my source language:</p>
<div data-language="idris"><pre><code>relu : (x : Int) -&gt; { v : Int | v &gt;= 0 &amp; v &gt;= x }
relu x = if x &gt; 0 then x else 0</code></pre></div>
<p>my compiler produces:</p>
<div data-language="idris"><pre><code>relu : (x : Int) -&gt; (v : Int ** ((v &gt;= 0) = True, (v &gt;= x) = True))
relu x = MkDPair {P = \v =&gt; ((v &gt;= 0) = True, (v &gt;= x) = True)}
                 (if (x &gt; 0) then x else 0)
                 elided_proof</code></pre></div>
<p>We see here that the output <code>relu</code> produces a dependent pair (the <code>**</code> is
Idris’ syntax for dependent pairs) that follows closely the refinements
specified in the input <code>relu</code>. The <code>elided_proof</code> is actually part of the
output: we are not yet concerned with converting the actual SMT-provided proof
into Idris, so we just trust the solver and erase its proof.</p>
<p>I soon started hitting the limitations of the type system described in the
paper mentioned above. Critically, that paper does not support function
application in refinements. Yet consider this example:</p>
<div data-language="idris"><pre><code>f : (x : Int) -&gt; { v : Int | v &gt; x }
g : Int -&gt; Int
h : Int -&gt; Int
h y = f (g y)</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, to type check the body of <code>h</code>, the <code>x</code> in <code>f</code>’s type gets
substituted by <code>g y</code>, so the return type is <code>{ v : Int | v &gt; g y }</code>, but the
refinement language cannot express this type! So I just extended the source
language to support refinements with arbitrary terms, also bringing it much
closer to what dependently typed languages can express.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the translation</h2>
<p>This was perhaps two or three weeks into the Fellowship, when my Tweag mentor,
Richard Eisenberg, and I started discussing what should be the final
deliverable of the 12 weeks. There were two options of bringing this to
fruition:</p>
<ol>
<li>I could take my experience with the toy prototype and do something like
Liquid Haskell, but for Idris.</li>
<li>I could also work on a research paper capturing this idea of compiling
refinement types into dependent types. But what would the main proof in the
paper be?</li>
</ol>
<p>At this moment, I decided with Richard to establish a theoretical foundation
to what I am doing, and work on a research paper formalizing that. This paper
would be the deliverable for my fellowship.
The weekly calls with Richard became way more substantial. First, we
agreed to start writing the paper from its guts, describing some surface
language (essentially, the simply-typed lambda calculus with refinements),
some core dependently typed language (Calculus of Constructions looked like
the right candidate) and defining a translation from the former to the latter.
It also became obvious what needs to be proven: ultimately, the translation μ
is correct if any well-typed surface language term ε translates into a
well-typed core language term μ(ε) and if translation “commutes” with the
languages’ operational semantics, as shown in this diagram:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Richard soon suggested to abstract away the notion of an SMT, replacing it
with a black-box oracle. This abstraction was very fruitful in both the
implementation (I separated query generation from solving, bringing a fair
share of insights) and the paper (allowing a focus on what matters for my
specific work).</p>
<p>With that abstraction, writing the paper was pretty straightforward at first:
I just needed to formalize the syntax and the typing rules. However, the paper
started to deviate from the implementation more and more. For instance, the
initial surface language from the paper supported booleans and
if-then-else, but it wasn’t
obvious how to expand all that to arbitrary algebraic data types (ADTs), especially
having constructors with data members (as opposed to an enumeration like <code>data Bool = True | False</code>). I thus added ADTs in the language, and I needed
pattern matching sufficiently expressive to enable proofs in the case branches
to depend on the choice of branch, a property called <em>path sensitivity</em>.</p>
<p>Path sensitivity implies that each <code>case</code> branch needs to remember the
relationship between the scrutinee and the variables introduced by the branch
pattern. In other words, if there is <code>case s of Con x1 x2 ... -&gt; ...</code> then
there should be a proof that <code>s = Con x1 x2 ...</code> available on the right-hand
side of the pattern. Expressing this in the classical dependently typed
language formulation turned out to be quite difficult, so Richard and I
accordingly decided to add all the required machinery to the core language.</p>
<p>The paper is not yet finished, though, but it’s <a href="https://github.com/0xd34df00d/refinedt/releases/download/paper-2020-09-24-7b77365d/paper.pdf">quite
close</a>
to completion, with several key results already proved. Beyond that paper, I
also plan to get back to coding and complete something like Liquid Idris,
fulfilling the first option for the project I mentioned above.</p>
<h2>The experience</h2>
<p>Beyond just the technical work above, it may be helpful to readers to learn
about my experience as an Open Source Fellow.</p>
<p>Firstly, all the conversations with Richard would be meaningful even if they
only helped the project to go forward. But I’d like to emphasize the
importance of observing how somebody else thinks, analyzes, what questions
they ask, and so on. It’s like learning how others learn, and learning not
just specific answers but also figuring out how they arrived at those answers
(and any questions, which are equally important). It’s way more important in
the long run.</p>
<p>Secondly, even building the type systems for some specific goal, let alone
formulating and proving all those theorems, turned out to be an enlightening
experience. Of course, “learning by doing” is a well-known concept. Still,
even then, one thing is to follow somebody else’s exposition of existing
theory and learn by doing, say, exercises in a book, but trying to come up
with something of one’s own that makes sense is entirely different. That’s
when it becomes clear why specific theories are built the way there are.
Making one’s own little theory is an existential experience!</p>
<p>And, finally, sometimes the exciting problems are lurking somewhere where you
least expect to encounter them. For example, that question of encoding ADTs to
allow dependent pattern matching proved to be one of the most challenging
problems I faced while working on this project. Of course, I made a mental
note to get back to it once I complete this project, yet I stumbled upon that
question almost by chance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, this Fellowship was a very enlightening experience. I had lots of
fun working on the original toy language implementation and trying to
formalize what I’ve done with pen and paper and discuss all of that with
Richard.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

The energy hub will be an artificially constructed island 80 kilometers from the shore of the peninsula Jutland. It will be owned by a public-private partnership. The hub </strong><strong>will strengthen the integration of Europe’s power grids and increase renewable electricity production necessary for a climate neutral Europe.</strong></p><p>Denmark has introduced cutoff date of 2050 for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and canceled all future licensing rounds. Today, by agreeing on the construction and ownership of the world’s first energy hub in the North Sea, Denmark takes another significant step in the green transition. The energy hub will produce yet unseen amounts of green electricity and is one of the government's flagship projects for the green transition in Europe. Fully implemented it will be able to cover the consumption of 10 million European households </p><p><em>”This is truly a great moment for Denmark and for the global green transition. This decision marks the start of a new era of sustainable energy production in Denmark and the world </em><em>and </em><em>it links very ambitious climate goals with growth and green jobs.</em><em>The energy hub in the North Sea will be </em><em>the largest construction project in Danish history. It</em><em> will make a big contribution to the realization of the enormous potential for European offshore wind, and I am excited for our future collaboration with other European countries”, </em>says the Danish Minister for Climate, Dan Jørgensen.  </p><p>The energy hub will serve as an offshore power plant gathering and distributing green electricity from hundreds of wind turbines surrounding the island directly to consumers in countries surrounding the North Sea. The island is expected to have a total area of at least 120.000 square meters and in its first phase it will be able to provide 3 million European households with green energy.The project will be a public private partnership between the Danish state and private companies. The State will own the majority of the island, but private companies will be crucial for the project to fulfill the potential as regards to innovation, flexibility, cost-effectiveness and business potentials. </p><p><em>“We are at the dawn of a new era for energy. Last year, Denmark set a cutoff date for fossil fuel extraction. Today we are taking a decisive step toward a clean energy future. The EU has set a goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and the Commission has set a target of 300 GW offshore wind energy in order to attain this goal. By constructing the world’s first energy hub with a potential capacity of 10 GW, Denmark significantly contributes to this ambitious target. Not only by dramatically expanding renewable energy production, but also by supplying our European neighbors with an abundance of renewable energy”, </em>says the Danish Minister for Climate, Dan Jørgensen. <strong></strong></p><p>The artificial island will offer the best opportunities to expand the project, for example by building a harbor and facilities for storage and conversion of green electricity from the nearby wind turbines in the sea. It is the long-term ambition to be able to store green electricity on the island, convert it to liquid green fuel, and send it via subsea cables to Denmark and neighboring countries. </p><p>Details about the ownership of the island will be specified in order for a tender for private partnerships to be opened, making the island a reality as soon as possible. </p><h3><a href="https://ens.dk/en/our-responsibilities/wind-power/energy-islands">Read more about the energy islands.</a></h3><h3><a href="https://en.kefm.dk/Media/0/F/Engelsk%20faktaark%20energi%C3%B8er.pdf" target="_blank">Read the fact sheet about energy hubs on kefm.dk.</a></h3><h3>
<strong>Facts about the energy islands</strong><strong></strong>
</h3><ul>
<li>A broad coalition of Danish parties have decided to establish two energy hubs and associated offshore windfarms. One as an artificial island in the North Sea and one at the Danish island Bornholm. </li>
<li>An energy hub serves as a hub that collects electricity from the surrounding offshore windfarms and distributes the electricity between countries connected via the electricity grid. </li>
<li>Furthermore, the abundance of offshore wind energy can be used to produce climate-friendly fuels for shipping, aviation, heavy industries or heavy-duty vehicles. </li>
<li>The two hubs initial capacity will be 5 GW triple the current installed offshore capacity in Denmark. Later they will be expanded to provide a capacity of 12 GW in total.</li>
<li>In the North Sea, the island and offshore windfarms will be located at least 80 km west of the coast of Jutland. Around 200 wind turbines are expected in the first phase of the project.  </li>
<li>Last year Denmark reached a deal on the future of fossil extraction in the North Sea, leading to the cancellation of the ongoing 8th licensing round and all future rounds to extract oil and gas. </li>
<li>The deal also established a final phase-out date of fossil extraction by 2050 and laid out plans for a just transition of impacted workers.</li>
<li>Denmark is currently the largest oil producer in the EU, and it is the biggest producer worldwide to establish a final phase-out date so far.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>The Mellium project is a collection of libraries and applications in Go relating
to XMPP and instant messaging. This post is a copy of a message sent to the
xmpp-standards list in response to a call for updates on XMPP related projects
from the past year.</p>
<p>But first: <strong>Why XMPP?</strong></p>
<p>I recently got asked (and I’m paraphrasing here): “why would you write an XMPP
library when trendier technologies are available?”
The quick answer is that XMPP is still the most widely used federated instant
messaging protocol available on the internet.
Despite the demise of XMPP in a few big chat services that users were familiar
with (HipChat, Google Talk, Facebook Messenger), it is still widely used in
video games (WarFace, Nintendo Switch presence notifications, etc.), in current
chat products (Zoom, WhatsApp, Jitsi Meet, etc.), and in industry.
XMPP is a core part of internet infrastructure and has a robust ecosystem of
both free and commercial products, servers, and clients built around it.
We need this infrastructure in Go.</p>
<p>Now, on to the status update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year the main Go module of the Mellium project, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a>
received a huge number of updates, bug fixes, and API overhauls, many of which
will be released in the upcoming <code>v0.18.0</code> release.
Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebSocket support</li>
<li>The ability to negotiate multiple virtual hosts</li>
<li>More server side implementations of stream features such as SASL and resource
binding</li>
<li>An implementation of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0393.html">Message styling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0333.html">Chat marker</a> support</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0202.html">XEP-0202: Entity Time</a> and
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0082.html">XEP-0082: XMPP Date and Time Profiles</a></li>
<li>Integration testing against common servers and clients</li>
<li>Better fallback behavior when looking up XMPP servers</li>
<li>Easier sending of IQs without having to think about XML tokens</li>
<li>Easier APIs for registering handlers against specific IQ payloads</li>
<li>XMPP URI and IRI parsing support</li>
</ul>
<p>The full (much longer) list can be found in the <a href="https://mellium.im/xmpp/changelog">changelog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="message-styling">Message Styling</h2>
<p>The change to <code>mellium.im/xmpp</code> that I’m most proud of in the past year might be
the Message Styling implementation which can be found at
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling"><code>mellium.im/xmpp/styling</code></a>.</p>
<p>The actual styling implementation comprises three parts: the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Style"><code>Style</code></a> type, the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Scan"><code>Scan</code></a> function, and the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a> type.</p>
<p>The <code>Scan</code> function is a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#SplitFunc"><code>bufio.SplitFunc</code></a> that is used to tokenize the byte
stream internally.
It is exported as a convenience to allow new message styling implementations
that behave differently or have other extensions built on top of it.</p>
<p>The <code>Style</code> type is a <code>uint32</code> that represents a bitmask of styles such as
“strong and emph” or “pre-formatted text and block quoted”.
It only contains information about the styles, not about metadata related to
the styles or the token stream.
For example, given a style you can know that the text is in a blockquote, but
not the level of nesting (if any) of the blockquote, or you might know that it
is in a strong span, but not where the start and endpoints of that span are.
The package provides the various styles and a handful of masks for various
common combinations as constants for the users convenience.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>Decoder</code> type pairs the <code>Scan</code> function with the <code>Style</code> type by
scanning for tokens and keeping track of the stream state.
It allows you to get the style of each token popped, and keeps track of metadata
about the styles such as the level of nesting in block quotes or the tag on a
fenced code block.</p>
<p>Here is an example of quickly tokenizing an input stream:</p>
<pre><code>	r := strings.NewReader(`The full title is
_Twelfth Night, or What You Will_
but *most* people shorten it.`)
	d := styling.NewDecoder(r)

	var err error
	var tok styling.Token
	for {
		tok, err = d.Token()
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
		fmt.Printf("Token: %q\n", tok.Data)
	}
	if err != nil &amp;&amp; err != io.EOF {
		panic(err)
	}
  // Token: "The full title is\n"
  // Token: "_"
  // Token: "Twelfth Night, or What You Will"
  // Token: "_"
  // Token: "\n"
  // Token: "but "
  // Token: "*"
  // Token: "most"
  // Token: "*"
  // Token: " people shorten it."
</code></pre><p>A more extensive example for converting styling tokens to HTML can be found in
the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#example-package-Html">package examples</a>.
For more, see my retrospective post, <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2020/11/message-styling/"><em>Message Styling</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="stream-initialization-and-virtual-hosts">Stream Initialization and Virtual Hosts</h2>
<p>XMPP servers likely want to serve more than one domain, but prior to the
upcoming v0.18.0 release this was difficult or impossible.
This required changes to the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Negotiator"><code>Negotiator</code></a> type to allow input and output
streams to be stored on the session, and to the built-in <code>Negotiator</code>’s
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamConfig"><code>StreamConfig</code></a> type which is used for configuring options on the built in
default negotiator to allow the user to select the features in a callback.
Unfortunately, these are breaking changes, but it should be one of the last
major API changes before we can begin thinking about stabilizing the API in
v1.0.0.</p>
<p>The <code>S2S</code> option was also removed from the <code>StreamConfig</code> in favor of new
functions for receiving and negotiating a stream which mark the s2s state bit on
the session before beginning negotiation.
This removes a long standing redundancy, and also a bug where the first stream
feature negotiated wouldn’t know that the session was a server-to-server session
because it couldn’t be set until the negotiator function returned for the first
time.
The current list of stream negotiation functions is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialClientSession"><code>DialClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialServerSession"><code>DialServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialSession"><code>DialSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewClientSession"><code>NewClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewServerSession"><code>NewServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewSession"><code>NewSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveClientSession"><code>ReceiveClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveServerSession"><code>ReceiveServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveSession"><code>ReceiveSession</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>While it’s not an exciting user-facing feature, one of the most valuable changes
this year has been the addition of integration testing against <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a>,
Ejabberd, McAbber (Loudmouth), and <code>sendxmpp(1)</code>.
We’ve already caught several issues both in Mellium and in some of the services
we’re testing against thanks to the new tests!
This is all facilitated by the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/internal/integration"><code>internal/integration</code></a> package which provides a
framework for starting an external application, generating certificates, and
passing around file handles.
It works by creating a temporary directory where any config files can be stored,
then launching the process using that temp directory as a working directory.
It also provides generic options for writing files to that directory that can be
used by the child packages, such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/internal/integration/prosody"><code>prosody</code></a>, to write more specific options
that write the prosody config file.
The integration testing packages also provide functionality for running
sub-tests, each one of which will get its own child process with all the
configuration automatically.
For example, to test sending a ping to Prosody and Ejabberd and receiving a ping
on Prosody we might write something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>func TestIntegrationSendPing(t *testing.T) {
	prosodyRun := prosody.Test(context.TODO(), t,
		integration.Log(),
		prosody.ListenC2S(),
	)
	prosodyRun(integrationSendPing)
	prosodyRun(integrationRecvPing)

	ejabberdRun := ejabberd.Test(context.TODO(), t,
		integration.Log(),
		ejabberd.ListenC2S(),
	)
	ejabberdRun(integrationSendPing)
}

func integrationSendPing(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, cmd *integration.Cmd) {
  …
}

func integrationRecvPing(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, cmd *integration.Cmd) {
  …
}
</code></pre><p>More complex options for loading Prosody extensions, generating and using
certificates and enabling TLS, changing the default username and server host,
etc. are also available.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>One morning I woke up and found that Telegram implemented a new feature called “People Nearby”. If you choose to share your location publicly on Telegram, you’ll appear in a list for users who are physically close to you. Not only that, but they’ll also see just how far away you are down to the meter. However, you don’t need to share your own location in order to see where people around you are located. These are perfect prerequisites to find out just how accurate this feature really is and, more importantly, whether or not it can be used to find out where nearby Telegram users live.</p><h3 id="privacy-101-your-location-isnt-anyones-business">Privacy 101: Your location isn’t anyone’s business</h3><p>If you’ve never heard of this feature and you suddenly feel the urge to delete your Telegram account forever, let me stress something very important: <strong>“People Nearby” is opt-in</strong>. By default, no one can see how far away you are on Telegram. You’ll only ever end up in other people’s lists by pressing the “Make Myself Visible” button. If you choose to try it out, remember to disable it once you’re done.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/share-publicly.png" alt="Telegram's prompt to share your location using the &quot;People Nearby&quot; feature"><figcaption><p>JUST DON’T PRESS THIS BUTTON OKAY?</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once you share your location, every nearby Telegram user will be able to look at your profile. This may include, <strong>if explicitly specified in your privacy settings</strong>, your user handle, your first and last name, your phone number, your bio and all your profile pictures. People will see exactly how far away you are. Strangers may message and call you. It is also worth noting that “People Nearby” allows you to see public groups in your proximity. Again, any user may read all messages, view all shared media and links and see all group members without actually joining the group. Joining is only necessary for active participation.</p><p><strong>Do not make yourself publicly visible on Telegram unless you have a very, very good reason. Be aware that you’ll end up exposing a significant amount of personal data to the people around you.</strong> I assume that the majority of people who will be reading through this article are privacy-aware to some extent, and I can only call on people’s rational thinking to treat this feature with the care that it requires. Be safe out there, people!</p><h3 id="a-feature-begging-to-be-exploited">A feature begging to be exploited</h3><p>There have been many different tech outlets warning about the dangers of the “People Nearby” feature almost immediately after it was introduced. <a href="https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html">Ahmed’s Notes</a> was one of the first to report its implications to the public and to Telegram’s bug bounty program. Telegram later responded saying that the feature is working as intended, and that users must explicitly consent to having their location shared with others around them. So as it stands, it’s a feature that is likely to stay.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/ahmed-location.png" alt="Screenshot of Ahmed's Notes on Telegram's &quot;People Nearby&quot; feature, showcasing how to determine strangers' locations"><figcaption><p>In fact, they use a similar method compared to what I’m going to present in this post, except I’ll be supercharging it</p></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you agree with how the “People Nearby” feature works is up to you. I will be sharing my personal thoughts at the end of this post. Regardless, I want to go on a quick tangent before I delve into the nerdy stuff. As mentioned at the beginning, I stumbled upon this feature randomly and found myself wanting to know how it works. I messaged my roommate about it who stayed in a different city back then. And within a few minutes, I found a new entry at the top of my list of nearby people: my roommate.</p><p>He had spoofed his GPS location on his phone to put himself six meters away from me. He then shared a screenshot of the app he used to fake his location and, indeed, he put himself right into my bedroom. This meant that not only was the distance shown for every user pretty accurate, but it also updated very frequently. I’m using the word “was” here because Telegram made the decision to not display any distances below 100 meters since then. However, we’ll soon find out that this is just a drop in the ocean, and that the accuracy we lose because of this change is easily regained.</p><h3 id="everything-at-our-feet">Everything at our feet</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram">Telegram’s Android messenger</a> is, like most of its core components, open source. This means that everyone can peek into the source code, copy it, edit it and create their own version of the Telegram app with whatever features they need. In Android, user interfaces and functionalities are organized into so-called activities. As such, the “People Nearby” feature finds itself in the <a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/eb2bbd32c17fa7f50009404f73b8a6a630f31bfb/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/org/telegram/ui/PeopleNearbyActivity.java">PeopleNearbyActivity</a>.</p><p>The code that requests a list of nearby users resides in the <code>sendRequest</code> function. It is called pretty much everytime the activity is navigated to and whenever the app receives a location update. The time period between location updates is ultimately decided by the operating system, but the Telegram Android app requests to receive updates as soon as possible.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/*
</span><span>    this code can be found in the LocationController class.
</span><span>    here, the app requests to receive location updates whenever
</span><span>    the users moves at least 1 meter, or after 0 milliseconds.
</span><span>    so basically, this is screaming "give me updates whenever you can".
</span><span>    see: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager#requestLocationUpdates(java.lang.String,%20long,%20float,%20android.location.LocationListener)
</span><span>*/</span>
<span>locationManager</span><span>.</span><span>requestLocationUpdates</span><span>(</span><span>LocationManager</span><span>.</span><span>GPS_PROVIDER</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>gpsLocationListener</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When <code>sendRequest</code> is called, the app uses the last known device location and sends it off to Telegram’s servers. In return, the app receives a list of nearby entities. In addition to their unique Telegram IDs, these entities also contain their distance in meters to the submitted coordinates as well as an expiration timestamp. From what I found out, users who share their location publicly will have their expiration timestamp set to the maximum signed integer value <code>0x7fffffff</code>, meaning they technically “never” expire.</p><p>The app then iterates over all received entities and puts them into a list of either nearby users or groups. Since I’m only interested in the former, I can just add my code before or after users are added to their respective lists. Fortunately, the Telegram source code contains a class called <a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/99f5637dda59bc405734342d3e2448701d63f2d3/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/org/telegram/messenger/FileLog.java">FileLog</a> which prints debug information to the system log as well as a file log located on the device’s external storage, if present. So all I had to do was to dump the user entity information to the file log on every location update.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>TLRPC</span><span>.</span><span>User</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>getMessagesController</span><span>().</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>peerLocated</span><span>.</span><span>peer</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span><span>);</span>
<span>FileLog</span><span>.</span><span>d</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>Locale</span><span>.</span><span>ENGLISH</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>"peer update [distance=%d, id=%d, displayName=\"%s\", expires=%d]"</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>peerLocated</span><span>.</span><span>distance</span><span>,</span>           <span>// distance in meters
</span><span></span>    <span>peerLocated</span><span>.</span><span>peer</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span><span>,</span>       <span>// telegram id
</span><span></span>    <span>UserObject</span><span>.</span><span>getUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>),</span>   <span>// displayed name
</span><span></span>    <span>peerLocated</span><span>.</span><span>expires</span><span>));</span>          <span>// expiration timestamp
</span></code></pre></div><p>Additionally, I logged the location that triggered the request for nearby users with everything the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location">Android Location API</a> offered. Then it is as easy as following the instructions in the Telegram Android app repository to install my custom Telegram version onto my Android device. I then wrote a short Python script to feed the data I accumulated into a SQLite database to run some queries on it later.</p><h3 id="excellent-math-in-an-imperfect-world">Excellent math in an imperfect world</h3><p>So now we have the ability to feed all data that “People Nearby” provides into a database. How do we find <del>hot</del> Telegram users in our area? Let’s assume that we live in a perfect world where there’s no measuring inaccuracies whatsoever. Let’s also assume that the earth is a plane (unless you’re a flat-earther, in which case you don’t need to perform any extra mental gymnastics). If we’re trying to find the coordinates of one particular user, then we need to look at how far away they are at every logged location.</p><p>The process of solving for a point’s coordinates given a set of known points with known distances to that particular point is called trilateration. At every recorded location, we can imagine a circle with the radius of the distance to the unknown point. Ideally, all circles will then intersect at exactly one point which is the one we’re looking for. However, to find a concrete solution, we need at least three points in a plane in order to solve this problem.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/trilateration.png" alt="Trilateration with three known points for an unknown point in a plane, perfect intersection on the left, overlaps on the right"><figcaption><p>Trilateration in a perfect world (left) and in our world (right)</p></figcaption></figure><p>But we don’t live in a perfect world. The earth is not flat (what a shocker!) and GPS coordinates always have some sort of inaccuracy. This means that our own and other users' locations mustn’t be accurate. The circles, which are actually ellipses once mapped onto the earth’s surface, won’t intersect in one location, if at all. We’re more likely to get an area where a lot of our known ellipses overlap as opposed to a definitive point on earth’s surface. And to top it all off, we can’t be sure that Telegram is actually providing us with accurate measurements.</p><p>Luckily, all this is no big deal. Let’s think back to locations as points on a plane. If we were to make an educated guess as to where the unknown point could be, then its distance from our known points will deviate from the distances we recorded. This is an error that we can calculate and all of a sudden, the task of finding a point’s coordinates on a plane turns into an optimization problem. We’re trying to find a point such that the computed distance error is minimal.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/trilateration-mse.png" alt="Trilateration but taking a guess for the unknown point, resulting in differences between measured and computed distance"><figcaption><p>Notice how the guessed point doesn’t align perfectly with the measured distances</p></figcaption></figure><p>Such an optimization method is minimizing the mean squared error. There have been countless explanations of this method in particular and I won’t be covering how or why it works. Instead, I recommend you read <a href="https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/03/13/positioning-and-trilateration/">this article</a> by Alan Zucconi who explains the math and its implementation in Python at the example of — you guessed it — trilateration. Instead, I want to touch on one more problem I encountered before delving into the fun part of visualizing all the collected data.</p><p>I said at the beginning that Telegram won’t show distances below 100 meters. If someone is within your 100 meter radius, Telegram will simply report them being 100 meters away for you, no matter how close they are to you. This appears not only on the frontend, but also …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Every social platform I visit is flooded with entrepreneurs making thousands in MRR. Yes, I have an ill tendency to follow people with successful projects. My monkey brain tells me I'll absorb some of that just by osmosis. Week after week, their numbers increase rapidly, and every few months, I'll get that revenue milestone article hitting my head like a rock. In this article, I'll write about running a slow loris SaaS called Tuemilio.</p><p><img src="https://tuemilio.com/storage/wink/images/M0zOmC52rAx5XBfQaTm0VmoV7yM6jHW5UZ2dv74u.jpg"></p><p>Remember when Robinhood was all the hype, and they put a form to join their waitlist? So, Tuemilio it's that as a service, you put a piece of code on your page, and boom, your early access list is ready. How sharp I was while choosing that idea, right? Well, that's what happened when I was naive - I don't know much now either - and I got fooled by the mantra "don't worry about your competitors."</p><p>I launched in late 2018, and Tuemilio got a few customers on its first week. That was the first time making dollars on the internet and the beginning of a mental burden. The initial excitement made me execute every good practice and experiment on the book. I was rushing feature implementation. I hoped to grow the project and exit corporate as soon as possible as my brainwashed brain dictated me. The problem was that the user base was so small that I couldn't gather quality feedback, and all I had was noise.</p><p>After a year and at $200MRR, I quit adding features because with all this non-stop hustling, the project was putting me off. I kept doing customer support and fixing embarrassing bugs. During this standby time, Tuemilio grew organically without doing anything, and I also started to see trends in the requests that the users were doing. I didn't have many users, but I had time to pile that feedback up. Quality feedback equaled the integral of user requests over time.</p><p><img alt="undefined" src="https://tuemilio.com/storage/wink/images/sCvOjuz6YGZ1evm8k0SzPTNdLiWyjhL6n8sk0v5L.jpg"></p><p>The most requested features were also the hardest for me to implement. Due to my lack of technical knowledge and burnout, I kept ignoring and delaying them for another year. Meanwhile, I was forced to scale my infrastructure. A sudden surge of traffic in a customer's website could potentially overload the servers, and it did happen.</p><p>I finally gathered enough energy to implement what I avoided for so long: custom email domains, a form builder, and an email builder. I also optimized database queries and indexes, updated documentation, and added a queue, a cache, and end to end tests behind the scenes. I learned lots of new things in the path, and I am happy with my new skills. I am also glad that my users will find the tools they need - better and faster. Now it's time to standby a bit and gather fresh feedback.</p><p><img alt="undefined" src="https://tuemilio.com/storage/wink/images/yk3x8kbpPS7Jc4yYaHs8f07adOyJeAGLiKQJUnL6.png"></p><p>After a bit more than two years in, Tuemilio is at $500MRR. No hockey stick graphs, but a milestone post that will hit somebody else head. It's okay to run a slow-growing SaaS. It's fancy for your non-tech coworkers but disappointing for the Twitter bros.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are still reading, thank you for that. You can always reach me and follow me on Twitter if you found this little story interesting.</p>

It has not yet been fully reviewed. This seemingly small project turned out to be pretty labor-intense. The feedback is rich, and there is simply too much mail and materials to process in one go. Apparently, <b>schools are a breeding ground of bad habits</b>. What was to be a short bullet list, turned out to be a longwinded article few will ever have patience to read. Please come back in the future to see a more up-to-date version. The list is far from complete</span></i>
</p>


<h2><span id="Are_you_at_school.3F">Are you at school?</span></h2>
<p>If you do most of your learning at school these days, this article should shake you up a bit. Do not panic. You do not need to quit or run away from school. There is a simple remedy to all problems described in this text. Rely on yourself and do as much of your own learning as possible. The mere awareness of the threats should suffice as a reasonable protection. If your parents are open enough, ask about the possibility of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a> or better yet <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling" title="Unschooling">unschooling</a>. Most of Nobel Prize winners went to school at some point in their lives. This text is not to scare you. It is to help you become a winner too. At worst, you may need to rebel against your current disciplinarian regimen (if any).
</p>
<p>A simple remedy against bad habits acquired at school is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">self-learning</a></p>
<h2><span id="Wrong_school_model">Wrong school model</span></h2>
<p>Some of the greatest strengths of the human brain are seen as imperfections that should be eliminated. The school system is built on a wrong model of the brain. It does not tolerate biases, heuristics or bold generalizations that constitute brain's great strengths. The model is an idealization, and the school system is pestered by a quest for perfection in the name of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fukuyama" title="Fukuyama">misguided societal goals</a>. As a result, school is a breeding ground for dozens of bad habits that literally destroy the intellectual potential of future generations. 
</p>
<p>At the core of the error of schooling is the quest to do more and to do it faster in defiance of the main decider: the brain</p>
<p>Human progress is largely driven by a small subset of great minds. Many of those minds survive the system of schooling unscathed. Survival seems more important than innate greatness. Invariably, the formula for success is based on a freedom to explore. I have never seen genius survive heavy drilling at school. All best minds around are free thinkers who forged their own educational paths. The survival is possible by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">lenient parenting</a>, lenient schooling, rebellion, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_schooling" title="Democratic schooling">democratic schooling</a>, unstructured <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling" title="Unschooling">unschooling</a>, etc. <b>On very rare occasions</b>, coincidence of interests may make some kids survive school by being passionately involved in the learning process. If you are not happy with your school life, you know things are already going in the wrong direction!
</p><p>Of the many bad school habits, I acquired quite a few too, despite unprecedented degree of freedom. I recovered within a few years by virtue of free exploration. Most of all, my job is all about effective learning. My path to recovery was relatively easy and fast. Most kids are scarred far deeper, and many will not recover their full self for life.
</p><p>Today, I am often labelled as a radical critic of schooling. My words are seen as exaggerated and even unjust. Perhaps I have not yet fully recovered from my schooled quest for perfection. As much as I cannot stand a waste of natural resources, or lavish lifestyles, I am deeply affected by words of my young friends aged from 3 to 18, who tell me this a few times per day <i>"I cannot do it because my mom wants to ..."</i> or <i>"because my school wants me to ..."</i>. I see that perfect summit of human greatness, and how great kids are being slowed down on a daily basis. This is nearly universal in my neighborhood. This is the root of my radical thinking.
</p>
<h2><span id="School_habits">School habits</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Skills_vs._habits">Skills vs. habits</span></h3>
<p>Schools stand in opposition to the efficient operation of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> of the brain. Schooling predates and continues the blind tradition of radical behaviorism in which the student obtains rewards for good performance or penalties for failing to pass the mandatory benchmarks. The ravages that occur in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a>, crippled <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a>, and feeble <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptual_computation" title="Conceptual computation">conceptual computation</a> are of no interest to the majority of decision makers in education. They are of no interest because the ministers, administrators, and executives have no idea. If neural networks are a bit cryptic for an average reader. The effects of schooling are out there for everyone to see. This list of negative effects of schooling has been compiled for you to have a quick preview of the scale of the damage we inflict on young brains. 
</p><p>Schools instills dozens of bad habits. Many of those habits can become occasionally useful as skills. For example, it is a skill to dutifully submit to authority when necessary. It cannot be a habit. It is useful for the surgeon to shows up in time early in the morning. However, the use of the alarm clock cannot become a habit. It is useful to know how to read a precious book from cover to cover. However, some books are bad, and completing the book cannot be a goal and/or a habit. To toss away a bad book in time is an important skill too.
</p>
<h3><span id="Countless_bad_habits">Countless bad habits</span></h3>
<p>In late 2019, I received a very interesting e-mail from a high school dropout Allen (not a real name), who explained that it took him quite a while to recover from bad habits acquired at school. I was delighted to hear that my claims at <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> agreed pretty well with his own experience and observations. I asked for a permission to quote portions of his mail and decided to list all bad habits that we acquire via conditioning in the process of schooling. I sent out mail with request for feedback to my friends who are fresh in the "recovery" process. Those who move from school to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> are usually most prolific in their observations. The contrast is so stark that some of conclusions seem almost universal. In two weeks, the list of bad habits grew to 42 (read: forty two). Even the routine violation of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules</a> may expand the list by 10-15 more bad habits.
</p><p>It became obvious I won't be able to discuss all individual habits. This is material for an entire book. This is why I decided to set up this page at <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Guru" title="Guru">guru</a> to incrementally add most interesting observations and excerpts. The title of "forty habits" soon became "fifty habits" and it stays as just an estimate. I am not sure what the ultimate number of habits will be, which habits overlap, and which need to be separate as independently harmful. Should devaluation of knowledge and the suppression of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> be counted as one? On Feb 1, 2021, using <b>Split</b> in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, I counted 104 bad habits and I still have some 10-15 to describe. The list of bad habits is staggering, and it could largely be avoided by the adherence to just one law: the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_Law_of_Learning" title="Fundamental Law of Learning">Fundamental Law of Learning</a></b>.
</p>
<h3><span id="Universal_habits">Universal habits</span></h3>
<p>Many of bad habits on the list can be acquired outside school, esp. in professions where freedom is limited (often by necessity). However, a bad habit may become dangerous when the entire population acquires it. When an authoritarian figure comes to power, we need as least one brave Alexei Navalny who would swim against the rest of the school. An average unschooler may pick up dozens of bad habits below, however, his unique trajectory and the collection of habits will be determined by his unique interests. As a population, we benefit from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Diversity" title="Diversity">diversity</a>, incl. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neurodiversity" title="Neurodiversity">neurodiversity</a> that is ruthelssly exterminated at school with "<a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Special_needs_education" title="Special needs education">therapy</a>". If I was to list my own worst habit, it would probably be "belief in intellectual perfectionism". I am slowly recovering, see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Value_of_wrong_models" title="Value of wrong models">Value of wrong models</a>. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">This site</a> is helpful in my recovery. I break many standards of "good writing", and do it proudly each time my violations serve the pragmatic cause of efficient communication.
</p>
<h3><span id="Good_habits">Good habits</span></h3>
<p>Naturally, for balance, a symmetric question arises about good habits we learn at school. After a week of deliberations and feedback, I could not list even one. 
</p><p>Many of the submitted suggestions stem from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_mythology" title="School mythology">school mythology</a>:
</p>
<ul><li> socialization should occur in open systems, not at school (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimal_socialization" title="Optimal socialization">Optimal socialization</a>)</li>
<li> knowledge is best achieved with self-learning, not at school </li>
<li> friendships are best born in real life, not at school</li></ul>
<p>In nearly all other cases, when people speak of good habits acquired at school, they really mean <b>good skills</b>, <b>not habits</b>. 
</p><p>For example, if someone claims that self-discipline is a good habit, I disagree. Self-discipline makes sense only if the benefits outweigh the cost, and that calculus must have a form of an integral with an eye to long-term effects. If someone shows self-discipline in early rising, he may reap some benefits at school or at work, but may also hurt his own health, brain and longevity. A set of procedures that protect one from the harms of early rising can be considered a toolset that arms a skill. That skill may be in use in an emergency, e.g. early rising may help when there is a need to perform a high-priority surgery on a patient. That skill cannot be a habit (e.g. daily use of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock" title="Alarm clock">alarm clock</a>). Teenagers should get up from bed as late as they need to, and use their best brain power for learning. The <b>skill</b> of early rising may be mastered at the time when the brain is mature and less susceptible to injury. Most importantly, the skill should be mastered only by those who actually need it. I never use an alarm clock, and my early rising skills are dismal even though I know how to use chronotherapy to get up at 4 am without pain. My only condition is: I need to start today to be ready next month.
</p><p>After a lot of thinking, I jokingly concede I developed one good habit at school: when I hear the word <i>"lecture"</i>, I run away. I still like TED lectures on YouTube. YouTube never complains when I decide to leave or pause. It always waits patiently.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As companies grow I see a tendency to focus more and more on data. While data can be a fantastic tool to understand behavior and measure impact, we should be mindful of its limitations. Many important things in life and business can’t be measured. A good related <a href="https://twitter.com/necolas/status/1096221537537933312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">thought experiment</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine living your personal life such that you never took (or were allowed to take) any action unless you could first quantify or measure its impact. Now you understand one of the pathologies affecting the tech industry.</p></blockquote><p>How does something that seems so crazy in a personal context become the norm in the workplace? In short, we love tangible wins. This is especially true for high achievers. As Clay Christianson, author of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13425570-how-will-you-measure-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">How Will You Measure Your Life</a>, writes:</p><blockquote><p>High achievers want to optimize achievement. So they spend all their energy on near term tangible achievements. However, this can lead to negative long term consequences.</p></blockquote><p>In his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37868583-the-prosperity-paradox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">latest book</a> he explores some of these long term consequences: </p><blockquote><p>People who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to underinvest in their families and over-invest in their careers — even though intimate and loving relationships with their families are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness.</p></blockquote><p>Bringing this back to business, the proliferation of data is putting more and more attention on near term, easy to measure, and tangible metrics. In the short run this leads to stellar OKR updates and earning calls. However, in the long run it often leads to a frustrating user experience and a reduction in brand loyalty. This is especially true in highly competitive and fast changing environments where consumers flock towards simple and user friendly experiences. </p><p>Running 20 A/B tests to optimize button clicks may seems like a win. However, this hyper focused metric optimization attitude will more often than not degrade your experience over time and prevent you from the type of large scale innovations that lead to step function growth. As Evan Spiegel said in an interview with ReCode:</p><blockquote><p>For me, I think the big red flag for all of us should be when we put more weight on things that can be counted instead of the things that can’t be. Because the things that can’t be counted are the things that make us human, and the things that are the most important to protect.</p></blockquote><p>Data is not bad. In fact, data is a very useful tool to reduce uncertainty, validate hypotheses, and measure impact. However, we need to make sure we recognize its limitations. I love the way <a href="https://twitter.com/eldh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Andreas Eldh</a> puts it in <a href="https://eldh.co/human-driven-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Human Driven Decisions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Because data is sometimes great, we think it’s always great… <!-- -->[but N]<!-- -->umbers don’t show nuance, uncertainty or complexity. They give us an illusion of exactness. Data can tell us what is happening, but not why. Data can describe the problem, but not the solution.</p></blockquote><p>The tail shouldn’t wag the dog. And data, especially near term metrics, shouldn’t be the main driver of our decisions. Rather, it should be one of several inputs alongside values, intuition, and empathy. Squarespace’s Optimize Towards Ideals core value does a good job of articulating this balance <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->: </p><blockquote><p>While metrics are critical for tracking and testing the performance of our business, they are merely a reflection of our ideas and execution in the market. Our values and ideals are our decision making guide.</p></blockquote><p>Consumer expectations are rising. We expect packages to be delivered in days and digital experiences to be fast, simple and easy to use. While we shouldn’t stop using data, we should acknowledge the unintended consequences of overemphasizing it.</p><p>So here’s to recognizing the limitations of data and bringing our attention back to the nuances and intangibles that make us human. Less focus on metric optimization. More focus on understanding customer needs and deliverying value.</p><hr><p>[1]<!-- --> Between writing and publishing this post they have evolved this value.

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

</p><p>i was chanting "all rights worth shit" whilst casting meaningless Annual Copyright Update cantrips upon <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=Libtorque" title="Libtorque">libtorque</a>, a project from 2010's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vuduc.org/cse6230/">CSE 6230</a> with Professor Richard Vuduc, who can bench press you with his mind. libtorque was tremendous fun to work on, leading me to distill <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=Fast_UNIX_Servers" title="Fast UNIX Servers">many thoughts</a> that i'd been kicking around for a few years, but i consider it a research project and not an industrial-strength library. i don't touch it terribly often, though I do check for compiler warnings every few <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=Gcc" title="Gcc">gcc</a> releases. behold! the <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=File:Libtorque-presentation.pdf" title="File:Libtorque-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> i gave on it for GT's Arch-Whiskey seminar--yes, loves, i explicitly selected that background. i looked upon it approvingly, like Keats unto Chapman's Homer. i said, softly, "nicholas, you're really killing the ol' presentation backgrounds, motherfuckers are gonna be cheering when they aren't squinting". i might or might not have sung "don't let me get in my zone" with Kanye West. i thought it Good.
</p><p>indeed, meth is one hell of a drug.
</p><p>on my <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=TRX40" title="TRX40">AMD 3970X Threadripper</a>, the <tt>archdetect</tt> program included with libtorque failed out. I traced this down to the function <tt><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/dankamongmen/libtorque/blob/master/src/libtorque/hardware/x86cpuid.c">decode_amd_l23cache()</a></tt> in my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://nick-black.com/x86.pdf">x86</a> hardware discovery. <a href="https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=X86" title="X86">Intel and AMD</a> caches were at one time defined by a disordered map from integers to complete cache descriptions, as in each integer meant a completely different set of cache parameters, leading to code like:

 },

<p>dogs fucked the Pope; no fault of mine! now hardware architects can do some very strange things, and indeed I saw an Intel i7 of the broadwell era with a twice-cursed 6-way TLB, and the 96KB L2 of the Alpha 21164 was famously <i>associativé à trois</i>, as befitted the carefree California culture of the mid-90s. tupac was still alive (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/187_(slang)">doing 187s</a>), big pete wilson was governing (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_California_Proposition_187">proposing 187s</a>), and the homeless were conveniently hidden behind piles of AOL install media (each man, woman, and child on earth had approximately 187 AOL cds). I once mailed Yale Patt about the 3-way associativity, and he responded with twelve pages of baseball stats descending into a challenge of pistols at dawn. "ps I'll predict your branches you brain-dead ass-eyed Atlanta son of a bitch pps send nudes" but i digress. anyway, however (justifiably) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/a6a9150a7d8fd5a7cbbd0112a641c4d1/tenor.gif?itemid=14477035">drunk with dankness</a> the AMD boys are, i very much doubt Dr. Lisa "the Su is for Superwoman" Su is letting enneadic caches out the door.
</p><p>so...what's goin' on here? i've gotta get back to profitable work for the moment, but watch this space for the inevitable solution. hack on!

</p><p>ahhh, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2017/11/54945_PPR_Family_17h_Models_00h-0Fh.pdf">Family 17h Processor Programming Reference</a> explains that this scheme is dank no more, and the fancy new 0x8000001D leaf must be used in its place. using said leaf, the results are what we expect, and my $2000 processor's big swinging cache is properly detected. i guess even a 3990X doesn't have enough cores to update the fucking cpuid pdf. they're paying by the electron down in santa clara--it's mad max times.

<p>one must issue a 0x80000000 ExtendedMaxSupport leaf request, and if 0x8000001D ExtendedCacheProperties is available, that ought be used (it also seems necessary to execute 0x80000001 FeatureExtId and check for the TopologyExtensions bit (0x0x400000) in ECX). iterate on the leaf until EAX returns 0. this is actually a nice upgrade in functionality, especially as you can now detect sharing of caches among cores, inclusivity/exclusivity, and whether WBINVD or INVD is in use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">

        

        <div id="content">
            
            <p><code>#Script</code> is designed as a small, expressive and wrist-friendly dynamic scripting language that for maximum familiarity
is modelled after the world's most popular and ubiquitous scripting Language, JavaScript. Its minimal syntax was inspired 
by other small but powerful languages which heavily utilizes functions instead of adopting a larger language grammar 
defining different bespoke syntax for language constructs.</p>
<p>Small Languages like Smalltalk, despite being one of the most influential languages in history, is famous for its minimal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Syntax">syntax that fits on a post card</a>. A language with arguably better power 
to size ratio is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lisp</a> which the inventor of
Smalltalk, Alan Kay has credited it as being
the <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">greatest single programming language ever designed</a>
after realizing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the half page of code on the bottom of page 13… was Lisp in itself. These were 
<a href="http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/">“Maxwell’s Equations of Software!”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/jmc.pdf">Lisp's unprecedented elegance and simplicity</a> spawned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lisp-family_programming_languages">myriad of dialects</a>,
some noteworthy implementations illustrating the beauty of its small size and expressive power is <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">lispy</a> by
by <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> (Director of Google Research) that implements a Lisp interpreter in just <strong>117 lines of Python 3 code</strong> (inc. a REPL).</p>
<p>Another compact dialect is <a href="https://github.com/zick/ZickStandardLisp">Zick Standard Lisp</a> which <a href="https://github.com/zick">@zick</a> 
has implemented in <strong>42 different languages</strong> including a <a href="https://github.com/zick/ZickStandardLisp/blob/master/lisp.lsp">recursive Lisp evaluator in Lisp</a>
implemented in only <strong>66 lines of code</strong>.</p>
<p>A more complete Lisp implementation in C# is the elegant <a href="https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs">Nukata Lisp</a> 
by <a href="https://github.com/nukata">SUZUKI Hisao</a> which is a 
Common Lisp-like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4578574/85785">Lisp-1</a> dialect with tail call optimization and partially hygienic macros, although
has some notable limitations including a <a href="https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs/blob/d4258ec4b5681b0854a0d464b708df9ae26bbe3c/lisp.cs#L1216-L1391">small standard library</a>, 
only uses the <code>double</code> numeric type and doesn't contain .NET Scripting support.</p>
<h3>Script Lisp Overview</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Script/ScriptLanguage.Lisp.cs">ScriptLisp</a> is an
enhanced version of <a href="https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs">Nukata Lisp</a> with a number of new features
that reuses <code>#Script</code> existing scripting capabilities to provide seamless integration with both the rest of <code>#Script</code>
(see <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions">Language Blocks an Expressions</a>)
and .NET including <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/script-net">Scripting of .NET Types</a>, support for all .NET numeric types and access to its comprehensive 
library of over <strong>1000+</strong> <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/methods">Script Methods</a> - optimally designed for accessing .NET functionality from a dynamic language.</p>
<p>To improve compatibility with existing Common Lisp source code it also implements most of the <a href="http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/">Simplified Common Lisp Reference</a>
as well as all missing functions required to implement C# LINQ 101 Examples in Lisp:</p>

<p>To improve readability and familiarity it also adopts a number of <strong>Clojure</strong> syntax for defining a 
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax#_literal_collections">data list and map</a> literals, 
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions#_anonymous_function_syntax">anonymous functions</a>, 
syntax in <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions#_java_interop">Java Interop</a> for .NET Interop,
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/learn/hashed_colls#_field_accessors">keyword syntax for indexing collections</a> and accessing index accessors
and Clojure's popular shorter aliases for <code>fn</code>, <code>def</code>, <code>defn</code> - improving source-code compatibility with Clojure.</p>
<h3>Lisp REPL</h3>
<p>In addition to being a 1st class language option in <code>#Script</code>, Lisp's dynamism and extensibility makes it particularly 
well suited for explanatory programming whose access via a REPL is now built into the latest 
<a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool">x</a> and <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop">app</a> dotnet tools 
which can be quickly installed in any Windows, macOS or Linux OS (with <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0">.NET Core</a>) with: </p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet tool install -g x
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you have a previous version installed, update to the latest version with:</p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet tool update -g x
</code></pre>

<p>Where you'll then be able to bring up an instant Lisp REPL with:  
</p>
<pre><code>$ x lisp
</code></pre>

<p>The quick demo below shows the kind of exploratory programming available where you can query the <code>scriptMethods</code> available, 
query an objects <code>props</code>, query the Lisp interpreter's global <code>symbols</code> table containing all its global state including all 
defined lisp functions, macros and variables:</p>

<h3>Annotated REPL Walk through</h3>
<p>Here's an annotated version of the demo below which explains what each of the different expressions is doing.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-scripts">Sharp Scripts</a> and <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> the Lisp REPL runs within the 
<a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-pages">#Script Pages</a> ScriptContext <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sandbox">sandbox</a> that when run from a Sharp App folder, 
starts a .NET Core App Server that simulates a fully configured .NET Core App. 
In this case it's running in the <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis">redis Sharp App</a> directory where it was able to access its static web assets
as well as its redis-server connection configured in its <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis/blob/master/app.settings">app.settings</a>.</p>

<h4>Enable features and access resources with app.settings</h4>
<p>You can configure the Lisp REPL with any of the resources and features that <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> and 
<a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/gist-desktop-apps">Gist Desktop Apps</a> have access to, by creating a plain text <code>app.settings</code> file with all the 
features and resources you want the Lisp REPL to have access to, e.g. this <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps">Pure Cloud App app.settings</a>
allows the Lisp REPL to use <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/db-scripts">Database Scripts</a> against a AWS PostgreSQL RDS server and query remote 
<a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system">S3 Virtual Files</a> using <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/protected-scripts#virtual-file-system-apis">Virtual File System APIs</a>:</p>

<h3>Lisp REPL TCP Server</h3>
<p>In addition to launching a Lisp REPL from the Console above, you can also open a Lisp REPL into any ServiceStack App 
configured with the <code>LispReplTcpServer</code> ServiceStack plugin. This effectively opens a <strong>"programmable gateway"</strong> into any 
ServiceStack App where it's able to perform live queries, access IOC dependencies, invoke internal Server functions and query
the state of a running Server which like the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/debugging#debug-inspector">Debug Inspector</a> 
can provide invaluable insight when diagnosing issues on a remote server.</p>
<p>To see it in action we'll enable it one of our production Apps <a href="https://techstacks.io/">techstacks.io</a> which as it's a 
Vuetify SPA App is only configured with an empty <code>SharpPagesFeature</code> as it doesn't use any server-side scripting features.</p>
<p>We'll enable it in <code>DebugMode</code> where we can enable by setting <code>DebugMode</code> in our App's <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> 
which will launch a TCP Socket Server which by default is configured to listen to the <strong>loopback</strong> IP on port <code>5005</code>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-api-gateway-access-logs">Background on API Gateway Access Logs</h2>
<p>Let’s get started with the basics — what are access logs and why are they useful?</p>
<p>Access logs refer to a single log line that is written out for each request that hits your API Gateway instance. They serve as a general summary of the request — what time the request occurred, the HTTP method and path that was requested, and the response latency.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache web server</a> or know all the letters in the LAMP stack, you’ve probably spent some time digging through access logs. As we walk through the specifics of API Gateway’s access logs, you’ll see some inspiration from Apache. If you’ve never used or even heard of Apache, have no fear — I’m pretty close to the same.</p>
<p>Access logs are useful for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debugging:</strong> If you get a spike in <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> responses, you can locate an access log to point you in the right direction to start your investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Performance analysis:</strong> You can analyze your access logs to look for performance degradations over time or to identify slow endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>While performance analysis is helpful, you can often accomplish this more easily with tools like CloudWatch Metrics. I’ve found that API Gateway logs are much more helpful in the debugging use case. </p>
<p>This is particularly true given how <em>broad</em> API Gateway is. <a href="https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/api-gateway-elements/">API Gateway has a lot of elements</a>, which means a lot of ways it can go wrong.</p>
<p>You could configure your custom authorizer wrong.</p>
<p>You could mess up your method response template.</p>
<p>You could process a request incorrectly in your Lambda function.</p>
<p>You could process a request correctly in your Lambda function but return the wrong shape back to API Gateway.</p>
<p>When I’m building web APIs, I like to alert on 500 responses to end users as that’s the most salient point of user pain. However, if your access logs are a mess, you’re going to have a bad time diagnosing the source of the user pain. Debugging a system that spans multiple AWS services turns into a Sherlock Holmes story without the satisfying payoff at the end.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor by structuring your logs correctly.</p>
<h3 id="access-logs-vs-execution-logs">Access logs vs. execution logs</h3>
<p>When configuring API Gateway logs, you will notice that there are two types of logs — access logs and execution logs. In the API Gateway console, you can configure them in the following screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064105-e9f2fa80-60be-11eb-9857-c4a57109c82f.png" alt="API Gateway console logging configuration"></p>
<p>As noted above, access logs are a single log line that is logged out on each request that comes to API Gateway, and they’re often used for detecting errors or performing data analysis.</p>
<p>Execution logs are detailed logs about API Gateway internals. They show <em>everything</em> that is happening within API Gateway on a particular request, including the request and response to your authorizer (if any), the request and response to your integration, whether you are using a usage plan, the method response transformation, and more.</p>
<p>This information can be useful when debugging specific requests, but it’s also so. much. data.</p>
<p>Here’s the execution log output for a single request I made to API Gateway:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064198-0db64080-60bf-11eb-9160-5107504c3c08.png" alt="Execution log example"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need to be able to read this. Just understand there are *a lot* of logs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This single request generated <em>32 log lines</em>. If you have this enabled for all requests, this can cost a pretty penny in CloudWatch charges. Unlike access logs, you don’t have any control over the format of the logs.</p>
<p>In general, I disable API Gateway execution logs in the normal course of business. If I have a hairy API Gateway issue that I’m trying to debug, I might enable them for a brief time. Once I’ve figured out my issue, I’ll disable them again.</p>
<p>For the rest of this post, we’ll be focused purely on API Gateway access logs.</p>
<h2 id="basic-access-log-configuration">Basic access log configuration</h2>
<p>API Gateway gives you a decent amount of flexibility in configuring your access logs. Specifically, you can include any of 75+ different fields in your access logs, all the way from the request time and the status code to the authorizer latency and your AWS account ID.</p>
<p>A bunch of those fields aren’t useful, and we’ll go deep on the fields you should and shouldn’t be logging in the next section. However, in this section, we’re going to cover some high-level points about configuring your API Gateway access logs.</p>
<h3 id="access-log-format">Access log format</h3>
<p>When configuring your access logs, you get to choose an output format for your access logs. In doing so, you’ll be constructing a string to be formatted by API Gateway. These strings can use values from the <code>$context</code> object that will be formatted based on the actual values of your specific request.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html#apigateway-cloudwatch-log-formats">The API Gateway docs show four general formats</a>, but you can make any format you choose.</p>
<p>Of the four formats that API Gateway shows, you basically have three types of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Terse, but obscure:</strong> You can use the Common Log Format (CLF) or CSV format to have a brief string describing your requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verbose, but human-readable:</strong> You can use JSON to provide an object that’s easily processed downstream and is easily readable when browsing in the CloudWatch Logs console.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>XML:</strong> Who hurt you?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at the first two options, starting with CFL and CSV. With these formats, your logs will look something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064263-2f172c80-60bf-11eb-8254-8000bbc92999.png" alt="Common Log Format access log example"></p>
<p>You might be able to parse some of the information there, such as the leading timestamp, the HTTP method (<code>GET</code>), the path that was used, and even the <code>200</code> status code.</p>
<p>But some of the other values are harder to understand at a glance:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064306-3fc7a280-60bf-11eb-8b40-78b9615e3c61.png" alt="Common Log Format access log example annotated"></p>
<p>What is this UUID? And where does this <code>319</code> value come from?</p>
<p>These obscure formats can make it harder to visually scan data in the console or even to write search queries or CloudWatch Insights queries to find a needle in the haystack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: The <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common">Common Log Format</a> comes from the Apache webserver. I told you there would be Apache influences! There’s one more, later on in this post. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to prefer JSON because it’s human-readable. If you’re browsing the logs in CloudWatch, it might look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064380-5bcb4400-60bf-11eb-9f8c-15ad9df5eed8.png" alt="JSON access log example"></p>
<p>Notice how it’s easy to pick up — you know exactly what the <code>requestId</code> UUID value is, and you know that the <code>530</code> value refers to the latency on the response.</p>
<p>This simplicity comes with a downside — cost. CloudWatch Logs charges by the GB for both ingestion and storage. The more verbose your logs, the higher this cost will be.</p>
<p>The CFL version of the log was only 103 bytes. In comparison, the JSON version was 250 bytes — more than twice as much. Additionally, these log lines were pretty sparse. As we get into the fields below, we’ll be adding significantly more fields to our logs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ease is worth the additional cost to me. Make sure you’re accounting for your most valuable resource — developer time — and not pinching pennies that end up costing you dollars.</p>
<h3 id="logging-iam-role">Logging IAM role</h3>
<p>Next, let’s get into everyone’s favorite topic — permissions. Like anything in AWS, you need to make sure you have the proper IAM configuration to write your access logs correctly. And there’s one quirk with API Gateway access logs permissions that has bit me a few times.</p>
<p>To allow your API Gateway to write to a CloudWatch Logs log group, you need to associate an IAM role that has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html#set-up-access-logging-permissions">permissions to write to CloudWatch Logs</a>. </p>
<p>The key here is that <strong>a single IAM role is configured for all API Gateway APIs in a region of your AWS account.</strong> It’s a singleton resource, rather than being an IAM role for each API Gateway API that you deploy.</p>
<p>In the API Gateway console, click on one of your deployed APIs. At the very bottom of the left-hand side, you should see a “Settings” option. Click that, and you will see the <code>CloudWatch log role ARN</code> for your API.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509926/106064571-b49adc80-60bf-11eb-835d-1ddebfd79216.png" alt="API Gateway CloudWatch Logs Role ARN settings"></p>
<p>Again, while this appears to be in the context of your chosen API, it actually applies to all APIs in your current region. If you’re configuring this via CloudFormation, you’ll set it up as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-account.html"><code>AWS::ApiGateway::Account</code></a> resource.</p>
<p>I’ve been bitten with this singleton resource from the following flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I deploy Service A, which has an API Gateway instance and configures the <code>AWS::ApiGateway::Account</code> with an IAM role created in Service A’s stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I deploy Service B, which also has an API Gateway instance and thus also configures the <code>AWS::ApiGateway::Account</code> resource with an IAM role in Service B’s stack. This overrides the current setting for <code>AWS::ApiGateway::Account</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remove Service B. This has the impact of <em>deleting the IAM role</em> while still leaving its value in the <code>AWS::ApiGateway::Account</code> configuration. However, because that role no longer exists, all of your APIs will …</p></li></ol></div></div>

Benchmarks show that the latest version beats LMDB, the fastest C equivalent, by 20%-50% on a use case similar to my most common load (storing graphs in Pijul).</p><p>My last post about Sanakirja sparked a few really constructive discussions, and made me realise that people still cared about the problem of on-disk key-value stores, as unfancy as that problem may sound. This post looks back on some design mistakes I’ve made when I wrote it, and includes benchmarks showing <a href="#benchmarks">it’s now faster than the fastest equivalent C library</a>.</p><p>Also, as some readers have noted, “sanakirja” means “dictionary” in Finnish.</p><h2 id="why">Why?</h2><p>A long time ago, Pijul was using <a href="https://symas.com/lmdb/">LMDB</a> as its backend, with a number of fundamental limitations, including:</p><ul><li><p>Being <strong>restricted to two datatypes</strong>: an array of B+ trees where keys are byte strings and values are either (1) byte strings or (2) B+ trees where keys are bytestrings and values are zero-sized. In Rust terminology, this is equivalent to roughly 500 <em>tables</em>, where a <em>table</em> is either <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], &amp;[u8]&gt;</code> or <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], ()&gt;&gt;</code> (a.k.a. <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeSet&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;&gt;</code>).</p></li><li><p>Being written in C, meaning that it is potentially fast, but <strong>hard to extend</strong> in any nontrivial way. About the “fast” part, <a href="#benchmarks">my benchmarks</a> show that indeed, it is quite fast — just not as fast as a carefully-designed Rust version.</p></li><li><p>More importantly, I needed to <strong>fork tables</strong> efficiently, without copying anything. This was especially important back then, when Pijul tables for small repositories often weighed dozens of megabytes. It may be slightly less relevant now, but now that it’s there, there is no reason not to use it.</p><p>This is implemented with an extra table storing reference counts of each page that is referenced at least twice (in order to avoid infinite recursions, the table itself isn’t clonable, and therefore all its pages are referenced once).</p></li></ul><h2 id="why-a-redesign">Why a redesign?</h2><p>There were just too many reasons: performance was first, then the overly complicated concurrency model, the suboptimal algorithmic design, and the suboptimal software design. I’ll explain these in the reverse order (so skip ahead if you only want to see my benchmarks).</p><h3 id="personal-anecdote">Personal anecdote</h3><p>Sanakirja was the first Rust project I completed, and yet it requires all the worst memory tricks I’ve ever needed in Rust. In hindsight, I needed that crate, so it was right to write it, but this wasn’t the right way to learn Rust at all. I also knew very little about disk performance, and my goal at the time was really writing Pijul, not profiling databases. And as <a href="#benchmarks">the benchmarks</a> show, it wasn’t terribly slow either.</p><h3 id="no_std">#[no_std]</h3><p>That’s right, this new version works without the standard library. It’s fairly restricted in that case, since there’s no mmap. However, the allocator is generic, meaning that it could in principle be used to allocate different things, like hard drive sectors in a filesystem.</p><h3 id="software-engineering">Software engineering</h3><p>Implementing B trees isn’t particularly hard in theory, but some bits of practice make it non-trivial, like keys of varying sizes (these can even cause the tree to increase its depth in order to stay balanced and keep their long-term performance guarantees!). Another complication is that the main costly operation in an on-disk datastructure is accessing a sector that isn’t in RAM, either for reading or for writing, and keys and values may be large, so we need to avoid copying or moving things around. Yet another nontrivial feature is that we want operations to be transactional, and allow readers to access the database concurrently with a writer (in which case readers see the database as it was before the current writer started).</p><p>One issue is that in a first-time implementation, it isn’t obvious to tell what belongs to the “B tree level” (which handles the high-level operations and does the “page management”, meaning allocating and freeing pages), from the underlying “node level” implementation (dealing with byte representation of data). Before you know it, the two levels are mixed and make hypotheses on one another. This makes it hard to see what matters performance-wise, and what doesn’t. After looking at my code again recently, I’ve tried to formalise here the lessons I’ve learned since my first steps in Rust back in 2015:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trust the Rust compiler!</strong> In a stage of the learning where you spend most of your time <em>fighting</em> the borrow checker (it was worse then, we have non-lexical lifetimes now), it is sometimes hard to see past that stage and imagine how the compiler will optimise your code, or what the LLVM pass will do. Also, on-disk B trees must define their own data representation, since data stored with one version of the Rust compiler must be readable from another version. However, one thing I’ve noticed when rewriting it was that I was often reasoning about what branches the compiler would cut, what loops it could unfold, etc.</p><p>I guess what I mean here is, sometimes you don’t need complex genericity everywhere in order to reach your performance goals, checking a constant parameter at runtime, or thinking carefully about mutable and immutable variables, can actually become compile-time optimisations.</p></li><li><p>I usually tend to try and get stuff to work as quick as possible, then profile and improve (the <strong>make it work, then make it fast</strong> idea). However, this particular crate made we question that approach in some cases, because it tends to mix the different levels, and make them less clear. One thing I’ve learned is that spending time building, benchmarking and profiling <em>basic blocks</em> may seem like it can delay the overall plan; however, in this case, exploring different designs for the basic parts made it clear which features of the basic blocks were varying, and which were necessary, yielding a more modular design in the end, which was key to the performance improvements I got.</p></li><li><p>Part of the art of writing mathematical proofs, especially in a larger paper, is finding the <strong>“min-cuts” of the graph of arguments</strong>. In the case of proofs, this means finding the smallest set of hypotheses you need for a lemma, which can also be proven independently in other lemmas. This isn’t easy, because a smaller conclusion may sometimes mean you’ve lost some hypotheses you had during the proof, and you won’t be able to use them anymore. The same happens in code, when you refactor common operations and try to use nice, readable abstractions: while that sounds like a good thing to do, you may lose hypotheses on what is behind the abstractions.</p><p>Concretely, in Sanakirja, we can’t always write to pages to modify them, for example if they’re pointed to by another tree, or if the are visible to concurrent readers. This isn’t very complicated in the case of insertions, because the worst thing that may happen is a page split. The 169 lines of Rust for the <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pmeunier/sanakirja-1.0:main/OP6SVMOD2GTQ6.PAGQA">new version of <code>put</code></a> reflect that.</p><p>However, deletions are harder, since page merges might cascade: if two pages A and B are meant to be merged, the key between them in their parent P must be deleted from P, and that deletion might cause P to merge with its neighbour Q. However, if P is read-only and Q isn’t, doing the operation lazily means that we can merge P’s items directly into Q, rather than first copying P to delete a key, and then merging.</p><p>When I first wrote Sanakirja, I remember being pretty proud of the following trick to achieve this: I refactored common code in order to use the same function for merging, rebalancing and splitting pages: I would first create an iterator, and then “spread” it on one page (when merging) or two pages (when splitting or rebalancing). While this may seem an elegant refactoring of common code between the three main operations of a B tree, it is also “lossy” in terms of the hypotheses it can make over the items of the iterator.</p><p>More precisely, here is an edited version of what I was doing before (<code>iter_all</code> returns an iterator, a <code>struct</code> with private fields):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>      </span><span>// Build an iterator for the left page

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Books are amazing, but the options we have to buy books and track our reading are terrible. A lot of us are locked into the Amazon ecosystem - buying books on Amazon.com, reading them on Kindles. Sites like AbeBooks and Goodreads were quietly acquired by Amazon. Even LibraryThing is now part-owned by Amazon.</p><p>Amazon embodies the idea that companies are legally required to “maximize shareholder value” - a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits">total falsehood</a> invented in <a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2311&amp;context=facpub">the 1970s by Milton Friedman</a> but nevertheless a guiding principle for a lot of American corporations. The company started with books because <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90430303/a-rediscovered-1997-video-reveals-why-jeff-bezos-chose-books-and-not-cds-to-be-amazons-first-product">they made business sense</a>, and they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/02/amazon-purchase-goodreads-stuns-book-industry">acquired Goodreads for the reading data</a>, and are now <a href="https://blog.stephanieawilkinson.com/posts/2020-12-10-yonderbook-and-goodreads/">killing its ecosystem</a> out of boredom or malice. Amazon has never cared about books.</p><p>Other companies can’t operate out of goodwill alone, but there are plenty of companies with more actual interest in reading, and with a less ruthless set of business practices.</p><p>I have my <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/12/11/indieweb-reading.html">own bespoke system for tracking my reads</a>, but crafting a Jekyll/YAML setup for books isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. And there are many social features I’ll never get on my own in this little website.</p><p>Thankfully, there are a lot of interesting new places for readers.</p><p><img alt="Indiebound" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-24-the-new-reading-stack-indiebound.png"></p><p><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/">Indiebound</a> stiches together data from lots of local bookstores to figure out where you can get a book locally. From there on, you’ll use the bookstore’s site - whether they support ordering online or picking it up.</p><p><img alt="Bookshop" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-24-the-new-reading-stack-bookshop.png"></p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/">Bookshop</a> is the latest company to try and create a seamless and fun experience for buying from local bookstores, and they’re doing a pretty great job of it. Walking through the aisles of a quaint bookstore can turn you on to unexpected new books, sure, but for getting <em>one particular book</em>, Amazon has had an edge in convenience.</p><p>Bookshop lets you avoid Amazon and support bookstores – though it’s a bit indirect. You select a local bookstore and the receive a portion of the sale, but aren’t actually the ones supplying the books. <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/12/bookshoporg-independent-bookshops-andy-hunter-waterstones">Some bookstores</a> have pushed back on the model, saying that it cuts into their in-person sales.</p><p>I think it’s a net positive: it does divert online sales from Amazon, and it supports local bookstores. Indiebound is a better option if your local bookstore delivers or you’d like to pick things up, but isn’t a direct replacement for Amazon - which I think Bookshop can be. Some book stores seem to like it - my local shop <a href="https://www.dogearedbooks.com/">Dog Eared Books</a>, links to their Bookshop page eagerly.</p><p><img alt="Bookmarks" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-24-the-new-reading-stack-bookmarks.png"></p><p><a href="https://bookmarks.reviews/">Book Marks</a> is sort of like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> for books - an aggregator of trusted book reviewers that you can reference to quickly get a gauge of a book’s reception.</p><p>One thing that’s really cool with Book Marks &amp; Bookshop both is that they eagerly support other sites embedding their review content - so you can see ratings of books on Bookshop that come from Book Marks. I could add a Book Marks (or Bookshop) widget to my reviews, if I wanted to. It’s a level of openness and sharing that’s uncommon in today’s web.</p><p><img alt="Italic Type" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-24-the-new-reading-stack-italic-type.png"></p><p><a href="https://www.italictype.com/">Italic Type</a> is a relative newcomer: replacing Goodreads with a focus on book clubs. I’ve chatted a bit with folks behind it - and I think it’s a cool idea.</p><p>There are a quite a few projects trying to fill the void that Goodreads is leaving. Italic Type, I think, might be the future of <em>social reading</em>, in which the social group is simply a book club. Social interaction on the internet is a notoriously fraught area, but keeping groups both small and piggy-backing on real-life relationships seems like a really smart way of avoiding <a href="http://contextual.design/context-collapse/">context collapse</a>.</p><p>Other projects are trying to cater to more solo readers - <a href="https://beta.readng.co/">readng</a>, for example, is one project in that direction. They’re all very early on and it’s hard to say which if any will emerge as the standard.</p><p><img alt="OpenLibrary" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-24-the-new-reading-stack-openlibrary.png"></p><p>Most book-related websites rely heavily on third-party data sources and pre-existing companies. <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">OpenLibrary</a>, a project of the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, is aiming for a lot more than that: OpenLibrary is a datasource, a reference for what books exist. It’s a place where you can actually read books, on the website, or listen to them. You can download eBooks. They have an API to access data about authors and publishers. Photos of book covers.</p><p>If OpenLibrary succeeds, the world of reading will be totally different: you would be able to build creative projects in the vein of Goodreads without nervously relying on data from some corporation or from WorldCat. You’d be able to read a lot of books by checking them out of OpenLibrary, regardless of where in the world you are.</p><p>Achieving OpenLibrary’s goal is going to be hard: books are one of the most complex, scarce, and specific datasets I’ve ever seen. The raw data can be hard to get, and there’s a tremendous amount of de-duplication required to associate different book identifiers with the same work. For my book cross-referencing now, I use <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a> and OpenLibrary when OL has it - and unfortunately, a lot of times OpenLibrary doesn’t.</p><p>But this is one of the most interesting projects out there, and as an open source project, it’s one that anyone can help with.</p><hr><p>Here’s what I think is still missing from the reading ecosystem:</p><p><strong>The Bandcamp of books</strong></p><p>Bookshop &amp; Indiebound are solving the problem of buying paperback &amp; hardcover books. But there’s something more that I want: a good place for eBooks. It could be:</p><ul><li><strong>Electronic</strong> - eBooks, delivered in one click</li><li><strong>Unfettered</strong> - a variety of formats</li><li><strong>Fair</strong> - you know up-front that authors are earning most of the money you pay</li></ul><p>This doesn’t exist yet. It seems like the conditions that make Bandcamp possible aren’t present in the world of books: there are fewer authors who can make quality books without a publisher, and book publishers are more hesitant (or less able) to sell through new channels.</p><p>For some books, OpenLibrary gives this experience. But for new releases and books that my local library can’t <a href="https://macwright.com/2018/07/27/sf-library.html">lend me through the Libby app</a>, I <em>want</em> to pay for them. I pay for my music - mostly on <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, and would be happy to pay for books, knowing that the authors are being fairly rewarded for their years of effort.</p></div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>Synology launched a trio of enterprise hard drives at 8TB, 12TB, and 16TB capacities along with a trio of “enterprise” NAS units. As part of the dual announcement, Synology is locking its new NAS units from using large hard drives from other vendors, instead only allowing its own hard drives to work in the units. Let us get into what is happening.<span id="more-50517"></span></p>
<h2>Video Version</h2>
<p>Although we do not normally do videos for news, we have been getting a lot of questions about this, so we have a video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Synology Locking NASes to Synology Hard Drives" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmoaP-AdyK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As always, we suggest watching that in a YouTube tab. That video is meant to be listed in the background.</p>
<h2>Synology HAT5300 Series</h2>
<p>Synology is not manufacturing hard drives. Instead, the new Synology HAT5300 series is effectively made from re-branded Toshiba drives. There is an 8TB model at $239, a 12TB model at $349, and an upcoming 16TB model that does not have a price or release date yet. As part of the offering, Synology says it has done some firmware work on the drives to help increase performance. Indeed, Synology says the HAT5300 drives deliver up to “274MB/s sustained data transfer” and are up to 23% faster in sustained sequential read performance in demanding multi-user environments compared with other similar-class drives. Here is the performance testing footnote:</p>
<p><em>Performance testing was conducted by Synology using 12 drives on an SA3600, configured using RAID 5, against similar class drives (Enterprise) with IOMeter (64KB blocks). Results are for reference only. Actual performance may vary depending on workload, testing methods, and how devices and software are configured.</em> (<strong>Source</strong>: Synology)</p>
<p>That performance note makes the 23% claim effectively useless since Synology is not naming the capacity nor drive they are using for comparison. A <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/data-center-platforms/ultrastar-dc-hc500-series-hdd">Western Digital HC550 18TB</a> drive is both bigger and has a sequential transfer speed of 269MB/s and 252MiB/s. The Seagate <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/enterprise-drives/exos-x/">EOS X18</a> drives can also hit 18TB and are rated at 270MB/s sequential transfer speeds. Again, since Synology’s performance note says IOMeter 64KB is being used along with MB/s, not MiB/s, the 23% faster rate assumes competitive drives operate only at 222MB/s. It seems Synology is using older generation drives as a comparison point.</p>

<p>The move by Synology to release its own hard drives makes sense from a corporate perspective as it is a good way to show its investors continued revenue growth. The cost of the bare NAS itself is often half or less of the total system.</p>

<p>Synology also has a trio of new NAS units that it is calling an Enterprise line. These NAS units do not necessarily have features such as Active-Active controllers (Synology has Active-Passive using external connections and software), dual-ported SAS drives, and other similar features. Instead, we think these units seem more of an attempt by the company to reach beyond the SMB space and into the SME space for the low-end of the enterprise market.</p>
<h3>Synology RS3621RPxs</h3>
<p>The first unit is the Synology RS3621RPxs. This is a 2U 12-bay unit:</p>

<p>This unit has an Intel Xeon D-1531 (6C/12T) processor, 4x 1GbE networking, and an 8GB ECC UDIMM for memory.</p>
<h3>Synology RS3621xs+</h3>
<p>The second unit is the Synology RS3621xs+ which is a similar 2U 12-bay unit:</p>
<figure id="attachment_50521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50521"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/synology-launches-enterprise-hard-drive-line-and-locks-out-competition/synology-rs3621xs-plus-hw/" rel="attachment wp-att-50521"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-scaled.jpg" alt="Synology RS3621xs Plus HW" width="2560" height="1085" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-400x170.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-800x339.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-1536x651.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-2048x868.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-696x295.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-1068x453.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS3621xs-plus-HW-991x420.jpg 991w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50521">Synology RS3621xs Plus HW</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here we get an upgrade to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-d-1541-benchmarks/">Intel Xeon D-1541</a> 8-core processor. This unit also adds dual 10Gbase-T networking as standard and keeps the 8GB ECC UDIMM. Memory capacity, like the other units in the trio, is listed as 64GB maximum.</p>
<h3>Synology RS4021xs+</h3>
<p>Finally, we have the Synology RS4021xs+ which is the 3U 16-bay option:</p>
<figure id="attachment_50522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50522"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/synology-launches-enterprise-hard-drive-line-and-locks-out-competition/synology-rs4021xs-plus-hw/" rel="attachment wp-att-50522"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-scaled.jpg" alt="Synology RS4021xs Plus HW" width="2560" height="1256" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-400x196.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-800x392.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-1536x753.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-2048x1005.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-696x341.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-1068x524.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-856x420.jpg 856w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-324x160.jpg 324w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-HW-533x261.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50522">Synology RS4021xs Plus HW</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here we get the same Xeon D-1541 and dual 10Gbase-T that we saw on the RS3621xs+. Aside from adding four more drive bays, this unit also upgrades to a 16GB ECC UDIMM.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Specs: Infiniband</h3>
<p>First off, we want to field a question we have received on these units multiple times: Infiniband. Listed on the spec pages for all of these units is 2x Expansion Ports (Infiniband).</p>
<figure id="attachment_50523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50523"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/synology-launches-enterprise-hard-drive-line-and-locks-out-competition/synology-rs4021xs-plus-tech-specs/" rel="attachment wp-att-50523"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs.jpg" alt="Synology RS4021xs Plus Tech Specs" width="1508" height="1054" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs.jpg 1508w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-400x280.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-800x559.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-696x486.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-1068x746.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-601x420.jpg 601w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-RS4021xs-plus-tech-specs-100x70.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1508px) 100vw, 1508px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50523">Synology RS4021xs Plus Tech Specs</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Intel Xeon D series was launched in 2015.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-d-soc-changing-broadwell-de/">Intel Xeon D – Intel SoC Changing the low end with Broadwell-DE</a> and Synology is using the post-<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-broadwell-de-intel-xeon-d-1500-series-and-sr-iov/">Xeon D-1500 series and SR-IOV</a> fixed variants of the chips with its new NAS units. Given the other I/O that the company is showing including dual PCIe 3.0 x8 slots, it is unlikely FDR/ EDR/ HDR Infiniband that could be repurposed into a high-end RDMA fabric.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12952"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-d-soc-changing-broadwell-de/intel-broadwell-de-architecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-12952"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture.jpg" alt="Intel Broadwell-DE Architecture" width="763" height="432" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture.jpg 763w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-600x340.jpg 600w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-16x9.jpg 16w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-32x18.jpg 32w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-28x16.jpg 28w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-56x32.jpg 56w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Intel-Broadwell-DE-Architecture-64x36.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12952">Intel Broadwell-DE Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, we think that what Synology is actually stating is that it uses a CX4/ SFF-8470 connector. This was a popular connector for Infiniband cables 10+ years ago. These are labeled as “11 Expansion Ports” on the units above. These ports are meant to connect to 1-2 disk shelves.</p>
<p>In the enterprise storage space, Infiniband has been used to connect multiple controllers together and also storage to servers. Indeed, Infiniband is often associated with high-performance storage today, but it started as a storage interconnect many years ago.</p>
<p>We hope that Synology clarifies this in its documentation.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Specs: Xeon D and Networking</h3>
<p>The Intel Xeon D-1500 series originally came out in 2015. After the SR-IOV issue effectively forced an updated chip from the launch Xeon D-1540 and D-1520, the company released new models, higher core count models (up to 16 cores publicly), and models with more networking. After the first generation Intel Xeon Scalable launch, we saw the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-d-2100-series-launch-central/">Intel Xeon D-2100 </a>series launch to bring the new architecture to the embedded market. We covered this evolution in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exploring-intel-xeon-d-evolution-xeon-d-1500-xeon-d-2100/">exploring Intel Xeon D Evolution from Xeon D-1500 to Xeon D-2100</a>. We also covered how the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/twin-lakes-intel-xeon-d-2100-platform-powering-facebook/">Twin Lakes Intel Xeon D-2100 platform powers Facebook</a>. When the 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable series launched in 2019, Intel updated the D-1500 series with new higher clock speed parts in its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-d-1600-family-launched-as-a-broadwell-de-update/">Xeon D-1600 update</a>.</p>
<p>Synology is using the Xeon D-1531 and D-1541 in its three new NAS units. These are Q4 2015-era parts. For new NAS units launched in 2021, that means Synology is still using current-generation parts, but they are certainly older.</p>

<p>For some reason, Synology is selling these parts with ECC UDIMMs, not ECC RDIMMs and in single-channel memory configurations. The Intel Xeon D-1500 series is capable of up to 128GB of memory in dual channel memory configurations with 32GB ECC RDIMMs. 128GB may seem like too much for a storage server, but it seems like a missed opportunity to add higher-quality memory to its enterprise solution.</p>
<p>Networking on the three units is quad 1GbE or quad 1GbE plus dual 10Gbase-T. If one looks at the 2021 generation of servers, 25GbE will be commonplace. Even in 2020 STH was using 25GbE on many servers just because it is a nominal cost upgrade over 10GbE and 25GbE enterprise switch port is growing so quickly. A great example is that in our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hpe-proliant-dl380t-gen10-trusted-supply-chain-server-teardown/">HPE ProLiant DL380T Gen10 Trusted Supply Chain Server Teardown</a> we effectively had the lowest-end configuration that HPE could put together but that even had a dual 10/25GbE NIC.</p>

<p>Between the processors, memory, and networking, the new Synology units seem like what would have been deemed “safe” or “mature” technology in 2017 or 2018. In 2021, this hardware feels almost a generation behind.</p>
<p>For Synology to break into the Enterprise market, we would have liked to see the company do something interesting from a hardware standpoint that was forward-looking into 2021 rather than safe in 2017-2018. Synology has large hardware margins given its pricing which makes sense given its software and warranty. At the same time, there was room to move to a platform that is more modern than state-of-the-art in 2015.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Specs: Locking Hard Drives</h3>
<p>Perhaps the biggest topic of discussion is locking the three new enterprise units to a compatibility list of hard drives. In the consumer/ SMB space, Synology would be directly going against customer expectations if they were to implement this. In the enterprise space, this makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50524"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/synology-launches-enterprise-hard-drive-line-and-locks-out-competition/synology-hat5300-picture/" rel="attachment wp-att-50524"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-HAT5300-Picture.jpg" alt="Synology HAT5300 Picture" width="667" height="441" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-HAT5300-Picture.jpg 667w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-HAT5300-Picture-400x264.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Synology-HAT5300-Picture-635x420.jpg 635w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50524">Synology HAT5300 Picture</figcaption></figure>
<p>An enterprise storage product is designed to be a package. The software, system, and drives need to be qualified and supported by a vendor. If something goes wrong, enterprises expect to turn to the storage vendor and get an answer. If vendors supported any drive into systems, then it would be nearly impossible to test and it would create a situation where the system vendor could point to the drive vendor and the drive vendor could point to the system vendor.</p>
<p>In order to move into the market, Synology needed to do some type of enforcement. Having a software lock that prevents other types of storage from being used is perhaps extreme, but it is how Synology is dealing with this transition.</p>
<p>Many enterprise vendors effectively do this. There are Seagate and HGST drives out there with special model numbers for large storage vendor arrays. The difference is that Synology is replacing the hard drive vendor label with its own instead of just changing a model number. Synology does support non-Synology drives in low capacities, but not supporting more modern densities is a signal of where this is heading.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge at this point is that Synology is using only Toshiba drives, and has very limited capacity points. That is far from a robust supply chain and limits Synology buyers to relatively small capacities. While Seagate/WD are offering 18TB/20TB models, Synology has announced a 16TB model but only has 12TB available now. That means that competitive enterprise platforms can be 50%+ denser than what Synology can ship today in its new Enterprise units.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this is something that expands to multiple vendors and multiple capacity points in the future.</p>

			<p><span>O</span>ne of the kids in my house feels bad for people named Karen. He announced it at the dinner table. “They’re not all annoying, or racist, or anti-vaxxer,” he said. “They don’t all demand to speak to the manager. How do you think the good Karens feel?”</p><p>I pass a plate of steamed broccoli to my partner, Amanda, and explain to all four kids that while the Karen-meme has been controversial,<sup>1</sup> and may indeed be a misogynist tactic<sup>2</sup> used to invalidate women’s voices, it’s not an oppressive slur. Nobody named Karen faces systematic discrimination on the basis of their birth name. So, there’s no need for him to feel bad.</p><p>He’s been watching extreme partisan politics play out on the news, reading books about race and gender, and he’s struggling to work out the nuance of who’s allowed to be a victim. Everyone claims to be silenced, censored, and canceled! Whose plight is real? It’s hard enough for the grown-ups to figure it out; imagine how confused the 13-year-olds must be. What counts as legitimate prejudice and stereotype? Where are the boundaries of cultural appropriation? When are sensitivity and tolerance required, and when is edgy humor good-natured and inoffensive? I do my best to address his concerns, to guide his thinking, because I’m a proud feminist dad and I’m trying to raise little social justice warriors. I slice into a panko-breaded chicken cutlet, remind the children to chew with their mouths closed, and reflect on how complicated fatherhood has become these days.</p><blockquote><p>Bad science can become a mythology that shapes our adult lives.</p> </blockquote><p>According to a 2015 Pew report, 57 percent of fathers in the United States identify parenting as something “extremely important to their identity.”<sup>3</sup> But the current conception of fatherhood is misaligned with their reality; it fails to provide men with positive aspirational models, meaningful opportunities for reflection, or the healthy psychological grounding necessary to optimally prepare their children for the 21st century. At the root of the problem is Dad’s inability to escape constrictive and outdated ideas about gender.<br></p><p>Take the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/why-sex-is-binary-but-gender-is-a-spectrum" target="_blank">difference between gender and sex</a>. Gender is the word that’s often used to describe the traits, characteristics, experiences, and social expectations that are associated with identity. Sex is the word used to describe one’s biological anatomy. Many parents try to be intentional when it comes to how we represent culturally constructed gender norms with our children. We do our best to avoid sorting playtime into pink and blue categories. We try not to make stereotypical assumptions about our kids’ preferences, aptitudes, or emotional constitutions. We recognize that if we assume sex governs psychology—that boys will innately conform with certain social conventions and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/58/self/why-women-choose-differently-at-work" target="_blank">girls will be drawn toward others</a>—we’re engaged in a fallacy of biological determinism.</p><p>Feminist parents are making progress. We still have a long way to go, as evidenced by the gendered toy aisles in most big box retail stores, but at least the conversation has gone mainstream. Unfortunately, we can’t say the same when it comes to Dad’s identity. Scientifically invalid assumptions about manhood continue to contour the fatherhood experience. Despite decades worth of research to the contrary, we can’t help but take it for granted that certain traits track with biological sex—as if men are from one galaxy, and women from another (I guess gender-nonconforming individuals must be either alien or lost in space).</p><div>

</div><p>This binary way of thinking—conflating sex with gender—is not only wrong, but also nefarious. It serves to validate male-privilege by asserting that existing inequities reflect nature. I call it “locker-room gender essentialism” because it reminds me of the so-called facts about the sexes that middle-school boys expounded on when the girls weren’t around. We were being socialized to believe that a lopsided power dynamic is immutable. Bad science can become a mythology that shapes our adult lives. Consider the entitlements that patriarchal societies bestow on men who are <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/nurture-alone-cant-explain-male-aggression" target="_blank">assertive and dominant</a>. These behaviors are often lauded as a male evolutionary imperative. Dads are told it’s their duty to protect a clan. It’s the natural order of things, the essence of fatherhood. “Survival of the fittest” becomes an excuse for ends-justify-the-means and winner-take-all competition.</p><p>In truth, natural selection works a lot like parenting: Adaptability produces much better outcomes than rigidity. Everything you’ve heard about fixed versus growth mindset, intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, and positive versus negative reinforcement points in this direction. Carrots work better than sticks. Spanking causes more harm than good. Shame leads to long-lasting psychological trauma. Punishments like time-out and grounding are only effective as interventions, not as a way to encourage long-term behavioral change. The old fear-based, father-knows-best, disciplinary methods don’t work. You and I turned out alright despite—not because of—Dad’s constant scolding and occasional smack.</p><blockquote><p>The most familiar model of the nuclear family still includes paternal roles which are inherently patriarchal, and often misogynist.</p> </blockquote><p>Notwithstanding the scientific consensus, fathers still struggle to evade the intense pressure they feel to conform with outdated and sexist cultural norms. Gendered parenting expectations are not only the go-to punchlines for stand-up comedians, but also the taken-for-granted best-practices when it comes to childrearing: Mom should nurture unconditionally and Dad should withhold affection—his “tough love” mirroring the real world’s apathy and indifference. Motherhood equals abundance, fatherhood equals scarcity. Especially when it comes to raising sons, Dad still believes the Oedipal fallacy that maternal dependence must be disrupted by a reality that’s hard, cold, and mythologically masculine. <i>A boy needs his dad to be the initiating gatekeeper to a dog-eat-dog world!</i> As sociologist Michael Kimmel explains, “We’ve constructed the rules of manhood so that only the tiniest fraction of men come to believe that they are the biggest of wheels, the sturdiest of oaks, the virulent repudiators of femininity, the most daring and aggressive.”<sup>4</sup><br></p><p>Dads perpetuate this lie each time they buy selvedge denim, bottled-in-bond bourbon, or Chromexcel leather work boots—coded signifiers of status—which subtly demonstrate commitment to an old-school masculine persona. The famous Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung used the term “persona” to designate an individual’s outward-facing attitude. He described it as “a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and, on the other, to conceal the true nature of the individual.” Jung knew that we all metaphorically dress in uniforms and costumes designed to show that we are the rightful players of the everyday parts we intend to enact. But often, we over-identify with the avatars we’ve created. We start to believe that we are what we pretend to be. “Masculinity,” author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote, “is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.”<sup>5</sup></p><p>You probably think I’m moving toward a familiar argument about the problems with toxic masculinity. I’m not. The truth is I find a lot of the contemporary rhetoric claiming cisgender men need more opportunities to express vulnerable emotions to be severely oversimplified. To put it crudely, it often sounds to me like a bunch of boys whining, “Somebody please, hold my balls while I cry!” Let’s be honest: If you already have unwarranted access to everything—including the authority to construct your own narrative—do you really need explicit permission to attend men’s groups, wilderness retreats, and cathartic drum circles? Isn’t that just claiming yet another privilege? An entitlement? I think so.</p><p>The toxic masculinity diagnosis was formalized in 2018, when the American Psychological Association issued its first <i>Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men</i>. That document says that men are so afraid of appearing weak or “feminine” that they bury their feelings; they over-conceal. This can lead to mental health issues, cardiovascular problems, substance abuse, violence, incarceration, early mortality, and more. Surely, we’d like to avoid these negative outcomes. But the toxic masculinity framework doesn’t adequately address the specific problem that today’s fathers face.</p><blockquote><p>You and I turned out alright despite—not because of—Dad’s constant scolding and occasional smack.</p> </blockquote><p>Economic, technological, political, and social norms are all changing. And fathers are stuck in a bind because the most familiar model of the nuclear family still includes paternal roles which are inherently patriarchal, and often misogynist. Many dads may want to see themselves as modern, evolved men. They’re legitimately concerned about gender equity. They try to be different from previous generations. In 2016, dads spent triple the number of hours per week involved in childcare as fathers did in 1965.<sup>3</sup> They also accounted for 17 percent of all stay-at-home parents, up from 10 percent three decades earlier.<br></p><p>Still, research confirms that they regularly reproduce the same old sexist labor disparities at home. According to Darcy Lockman, author of the 2019 book, <i>All The Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership</i>, even working mothers “devote twice as much time to family care as men.” Early research suggests that this divide is widening due to pandemic pressures. But the coronavirus may just be exposing patterns that already existed. In her book, Lockman describes how expectant fathers told researchers that they …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-99231dcfa6766efb0bfe"><div><div><p>The first thing that I notice as I disembark from the train is that I am walking backwards. The reason for this quickly becomes apparent as I engage a local in conversation, which flows in reverse as well. Though jarring at first, it becomes easy enough to pick up the narrative thread. I am leaving, forever, on the soon-to-be-departing train. Towards the end of the conversation (or its chronological beginning), I am presented with a choice of dialog options, both of which make sense with the preceding conversation. Herein lies the chief conceit of April March: the future has already been decided; it is the past that the player chooses.</p><p>There is something monstrous in the mere passage of time. When one is young, one wishes impetuously to be older. When age arrives, mirrors are regarded with suspicion and a measure of disbelief. Skin sags, bones ache, crowns rust, and empires crumble. Time robs us of our friends, our family, and our selves. It is true that April March has received lukewarm reviews, but I attribute these to the relative youth of the critics. They are perhaps too young to see that time in April March is not some gimmick of mechanic or narrative contrivance. It is far more than that - it is the central enemy of the game.</p><p>The game takes place over three days, from last to first. The battle system is framed as a standard turn-based JRPG, but the reversal of time changes the genre from RPG to puzzle. The correct sequence of moves will take the enemy from death to full health, and the player must figure out the right order. A failure to do so results in a "time glitch" and a game over. As complicated as it sounds, the game does a good job training the player how to navigate the system. The protagonist starts off at an overpowered high level, making the first battles in the game elementary affairs. The main character is gradually leveled down as the game progresses and complications are introduced to the battles.</p><p>The player's choices over the last day lead to three different preceding days, and each of those days can lead to three different preceding days again. In all, the player can participate in nine separate story lines. Each story line gives the protagonist a different history and a different reason to ultimately board the train. If any given story is viewed in the correct chronological order, it has the traditional narrative structure of rising action, climax, and falling action. However, many of the story lines reflect the same structure when viewed in reverse as the game presents them. One memorable story line plays nearly the same backwards and forwards, presenting a delightful symmetry. Others are admittedly less clever. Simone de Beaufort, the game's sole developer, suffers from a love of astonishment and overuses twist endings (or, rather, twist beginnings) in too many of her stories. The effect leaves one weary.</p><p>Some reviewers have expressed disbelief that so many different backgrounds and histories could converge to a single point in time. This objection is scarce to be believed when compared to the narrative of other video games. The protagonist in other games starts from the same house or prison cell or cave and, through the player's choices, can become incredibly different people. The player chooses to become a paragon of virtue or the lowest of villains, yet both of those persona ends up in the same climatic fight against the same final boss. How much more elegant to allow those two persona different beginnings! The protagonist is more a person and less a blank slate to project against. Because of the backwards nature of time, the main character (in any of the nine story lines) possesses an internal consistency lacking in less ambitious games.</p><p>Simone de Beaufort is very clearly alluding to her great-grandfather Herbert Quain's novel of the same name. The novel April March uses the same backwards flow of time and nine-fold branching of plot, and some of the more contrived story lines in the game are clumsy imitations of those in the novel. That certain other reviewers have failed to mention the connection between the two works I will generously attribute to ignorance. Quain's unfortunate dalliance with fascism in the 1930s, although brief, has diminished his reputation and few people in the anglophone world are familiar with his oeuvre. That biographic detail, however, is fundamental to understanding the game April March. De Beaufort shares many things with her ancestor - a sympathy for formal complexity, a taste for juxtaposition - but the most important detail is their shared disdain for the past.</p><p>The critical discourse surrounding the game has mainly concerned itself with the lurid details of the plot, inevitable but meaningless comparisons to Braid, and the symbolism of the parallel elements that persist in all story lines. To this discussion I will humbly add my own interpretation of the game: the past destroys us just as much as the future does. By inverting the flow of time, by forcing the player to choose who they were instead of who they will be, de Beaufort throws the past and the future into a stark equality. However the past is constructed, the player's character is still forced to board the train and flee from their home. It is an escape attempt doomed to fail, for the past cannot be mitigated. The past is a tyrant, and memory the straitjacket that confines us as much as it defines us. The truly free, de Beaufort argues, are those that can forget the past more so than those that can decide their future. Through a medium where choice is fundamental, she reminds us that it is the past, not the future, that robs us of our choices.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Summary: <code>ParseNumberF64</code>, <code>StringToDouble</code> and similarly named functions take
a string like <code>"12.5"</code> (one two dot five) and return a 64-bit double-precision
floating point number like <code>12.5</code> (twelve point five). Some numbers (like
<code>12.3</code>) aren’t exactly representable as an <code>f64</code> but <code>ParseNumberF64</code> still has
to return the best approximation. In March 2020, Daniel Lemire
<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">published</a>
some <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser">source code</a> for a new,
fast algorithm to do this, based on an original idea by Michael Eisel. Here’s
how it works.</em></p>

<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>

<h3 id="fallback-implementation">Fallback Implementation</h3>

<p>First, a caveat. The Eisel-Lemire algorithm is very fast (<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">Lemire’s blog
post</a>
contains impressive benchmark numbers, e.g. 9 times faster than the C standard
library’s <code>strtod</code>) but it isn’t comprehensive. There are a small proportion of
strings that are valid numbers but it cannot parse, where Eisel-Lemire will
fail over to a fallback <code>ParseNumberF64</code> implementation.</p>

<p><strong>The primary goal is speed, for 99+% of the cases, not 100% coverage</strong>. As
long as Eisel-Lemire doesn’t claim false positives, the combined approach is
both fast and correct. <em>Update on 2020-10-08: To be clear, combining with the
fallback means that Eisel-Lemire-with-the-fallback is (much) faster than
just-the-fallback, for ‘only’ 99+% of the cases, but <strong>still correct for 100%
of the cases</strong>, including subnormal numbers, infinities and all the rest.</em></p>

<p>If falling back to <code>strtod</code>, know that it can be sensitive to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator">locale-related</a> environment
variables (i.e. whether twelve point five is <code>"12.5"</code> or <code>"12,5"</code>). Discussing
fallback algorithms any further is out of scope for this blog post. <em>Update on
2020-11-02: the Simple Decimal Conversion fallback algorithm is discussed in
<a href="https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/parse-number-f64-simple.html">the next blog post</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>

<p>Let <code>[I .. J]</code> denote the half-open range of numbers simultaneously greater
than or equal to <code>I</code> and less than <code>J</code>. The lower bound is inclusive but the
upper bound is exclusive.</p>

<p>Let <code>[I ..= J]</code> denote a closed range, where the upper bound is now inclusive
and its the constraint is now “less than or equal to”.</p>

<p>Let <code>(X ** Y)</code> denote <code>X</code> raised to the <code>Y</code>th power. For example, here are some
different ways to write “one thousand”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3</code></li>
  <li><code>1000</code></li>
  <li><code>10 ** 3</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, here are some different ways to write “sixty four”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>0x40</code></li>
  <li><code>64</code></li>
  <li><code>2 ** 6</code></li>
  <li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 6</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Exponents can be negative. <code>(10 ** -1)</code> is one tenth and <code>(2 ** -3)</code> is one
eighth.</p>

<p>Let <code>A ~MOD+ B</code> denote modular addition, where the modulus is usually clear
from the context. For example, working with <code>u8</code> values would use a modulus of
<code>256</code>. <code>(100 + 200)</code> would normally be <code>300</code>, which overflows a <code>u8</code>, but <code>(100
~MOD+ 200)</code> would be <code>44</code> without overflow. In C/C++, for unsigned integer
types, the <code>"~MOD+"</code> operator is simply spelled <code>"+"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="double-precision-floating-point">Double-Precision Floating Point</h3>

<p>In C/C++, this type is called <code>double</code>. Go calls it <code>float64</code>. Rust calls it
<code>f64</code>. We’ll use <code>f64</code> in this blog post, as well as <code>u64</code> for 64-bit unsigned
integers and <code>i32</code> for 32-bit signed integers.</p>

<p>Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">double-precision floating
point</a>
article has a lot of detail. More briefly, a 64-bit value (e.g.
<code>0x40840000_00000000</code>) is split into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 sign bit: here, <code>0x0</code>, meaning non-negative</li>
  <li>11 exponent bits with a 1023 bias: here, <code>0x408 - 1023 = 9</code></li>
  <li>52 mantissa bits and, for normal numbers, an implicit 53rd bit set on: here,
<code>0x40000_00000000</code> is implicitly <code>0x140000_00000000</code> whose 53 bits, in
binary, is <code>0b10100_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000</code>,
interpreted as <code>((1*1) + (0*½) + (1*¼) + (0*⅛) + etc) = 1.25</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Let <code>AsF64(0x40840000_00000000)</code> denote reinterpreting those 64 bits as an
<code>f64</code> bit pattern. Its value is therefore <code>(1.25 * (2 ** 9))</code>, which is <code>640</code>
in decimal. An equivalent derivation starts with <code>0x00140000_00000000 =
5629499534213120</code> and then <code>(5629499534213120 &gt;&gt; (52-9)) = 640</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code> and <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000001)</code> are
<code>9007199254740992</code> and <code>9007199254740994</code> in decimal, also known as <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) +
0)</code> and <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) + 2)</code>. The integer in between, <code>9007199254740993 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) +
1)</code>, is not exactly representable as an <code>f64</code>. Relatedly, the slightly smaller
<code>9007199254740991 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) - 1)</code> is also known in JavaScript as
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER"><code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code></a>.</p>

<p>The sign bit (corresponding to a leading <code>"-"</code> minus sign in the string form)
is trivial to parse and we won’t spend any more time discussing it.</p>

<p>Non-normal numbers include subnormal numbers (with a biased exponent of
<code>0x000</code>) and non-finite numbers (with a biased exponent of <code>0x7FF</code> and whose
value is either infinite or Not-a-Number). We similarly won’t spend much time
on these.</p>

<h3 id="round-to-even">Round To Even</h3>

<p>Typically, when rounding a decimal fraction to an integer, <code>7.3</code> rounds down to
<code>7</code> and <code>7.6</code> rounds up to <code>8</code>. Rounding numbers like <code>7.5</code>, half-way between
two integers, is subject to more debate. One option is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounding to
even</a>, alternating between rounding
down and up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>70.5</code> rounds to <code>70</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>71.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>72.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>73.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>74.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>75.5</code> rounds to <code>76</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Properly parsing <code>f64</code> values similarly rounds to even: the evenness of the
least significant bit of the 53-bit mantissa. This isn’t necessarily the same
as rounding the overall value to an integer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>9007199254740990</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x433FFFFF_FFFFFFFE)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740991</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x433FFFFF_FFFFFFFF)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740992</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740993</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740992 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740994</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000001)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740995</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740996 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740996</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740997</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740996 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740998</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000003)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740999</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741000 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li><code>9007199254741000</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254741001</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741000 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254741002</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000005)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254741003</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741004 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000006)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="static-single-assignment">Static Single Assignment</h3>

<p>For clarity, this blog post presents the Eisel-Lemire algorithm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static
Single Assignment</a>
form. For example, a separate <code>AdjE2_1</code> variable is defined below, based on
<code>AdjE2_0</code>, instead of destructively modifying a single <code>AdjE2</code> variable over
time. Implementations are obviously free to use a more traditional imperative
programming style.</p>

<h3 id="multiplying-two-u64-values">Multiplying Two <code>u64</code> Values</h3>

<p>Some compilers (and some <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mul">instruction
sets</a>) provide a built-in <code>u128</code>
representation for multiplying two <code>u64</code> values without overflow. When they
don’t, it’s <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/internal/cgen/base/fundamental-public.h#L457-L469">relatively
straightfoward</a>
to implement with <code>u64</code> operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each <code>u64</code> is split into a high and low 32 bits.</li>
  <li>The four cross-pairs are multiplied (without overflowing a <code>u64</code>).</li>
  <li>The four overlapping <code>u64</code> values are re-assembled into a <code>u128</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-computed-powers-of-10">Pre-computed Powers-of-10</h3>

<p>The smallest and largest positive, finite <code>f64</code> values, <code>DBL_TRUE_MIN</code> and
<code>DBL_MAX</code>, are approximately <code>4.94e-324</code> and <code>1.80e+308</code>. We’ll pre-compute two
approximations, called the <em>narrow</em> (low resolution) and <em>wide</em> (high
resolution) approximations, to each power-of-10 in a range, such as from
<code>1e-325</code> to <code>1e+308</code> inclusive. Implementations can <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser/issues/28">choose a smaller
range</a>, discussed in
the <code>Exp10</code> Range section below.</p>

<p>For each base-10 exponent <code>E10</code>, the narrow approximation to <code>(10 ** E10)</code> is
the unique pair of a <code>u64</code>-typed mantissa <code>M64</code> and an <code>i32</code>-typed base-2
exponent <code>E2</code> such that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The high bit of <code>M64</code> is set: <code>M64 &gt;= 0x80000000_00000000</code>.</li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &gt;= ((M64 + 0)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &lt;  ((M64 + 1)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>&gt;=</code> in the first condition is <code>==</code> when the approximation is exact. When
inexact, the approximation rounds down (truncates). Whether exact or not, the
residual <code>R64</code>, defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) =  ((M64 + R64) * (2 ** E2))</code> or, equivalently,</li>
  <li><code>R64 = ((10 ** E10) / (2 ** E2)) - M64</code></li>
</ul>

<p>implies that <code>R64</code> is in the range <code>[0 .. 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s an exact example, for <code>1e3</code>, also known as <code>(250 * 4)</code> or <code>(0xFA &lt;&lt; 2)</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3    = (0xFA000000_00000000 * (2 ** -54))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an inexact example, for <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   ≈ (0xE596B7B0_C643C719 * (2 **  79))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, these two numbers bracket <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719 &lt;&lt; 79) =  9999999999999999999741184793924429452148736</code></li>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C71A &lt;&lt; 79) = 10000000000000000000345647703731744039501824</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719, 79)</code> pair represents an inclusive-lower
exclusive-upper bound range for <code>1e43</code>.</p>

<h3 id="look-up-table-columns">Look-Up Table Columns</h3>

<p>The narrow powers-of-10 look-up table has two columns for each <code>E10</code> row: <code>M64</code>
and <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code>. The <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code> value is <code>E2</code> plus a <code>NarrowBias</code>
constant (the magical number <code>1150</code>)  which is discussed later.</p>

<p>The wide approximation is like the narrow one except its mantissa <code>M128</code> is 128
bits instead of 64.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   = (0xE596B7B0_C643C719_6D9CCD05_D0000000 * (2 **  15))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The wide powers-of-10 look-up table splits <code>M128</code>’s bits in half to have three
columns: <code>M128Lo</code>, <code>M128Hi</code> and <code>WideBiasedE2</code>. For the <code>1e43</code> example, these
are <code>0x6D9CCD05_D0000000</code>, <code>0xE596B7B0_C643C719</code> and <code>(WideBias + 15)</code>. The
last two columns are shared with the narrow look-up table (<code>M64 = M128Hi</code> and
<code>WideBias = NarrowBias + 64 = 1214</code>) so that a single table holds both the
narrow and wide approximations.</p>

<p>The powers-of-10 look-up table is generated by <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/script/print-mpb-powers-of-10.go">this Go
program</a>.
The two <code>u64</code> columns are explicitly printed, and the one <code>i32</code> column is
implied by a linear expression with slope <code>log(10)/log(2)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="eisel-lemire-algorithm">Eisel-Lemire Algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="manexp10-form"><code>Man:Exp10</code> Form</h3>

<p>Parsing starts by converting the string to an integer mantissa and base-10
exponent. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>"1.23e45"</code> becomes <code>(123    * (10 ** 43))</code></li>
  <li><code>"67800.0"</code> becomes <code>(678    * (10 **  2))</code></li>
  <li><code>"3.14159"</code> becomes <code>(314159 * (10 ** -5))</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="small-value-fast-path">Small-Value Fast Path</h3>

<p>If the mantissa is zero, then the parsed <code>f64</code> is trivially zero.</p>

<p>If the mantissa is non-zero but less than <code>(1 &lt;&lt; 53)</code> then it is still exactly
representable as an <code>f64</code>. …</p></div></div>

</p>
<hr>
<p>It was Friday and I closed my laptop. I had worked pretty hard on <a href="https://scraperbox.com/">Scraperbox</a> that week and decided it was time for some well earned weekend time. </p>
<p>When I logged into Google Cloud the next Monday my heart sank. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://scraperbox.com/img/blog/google-cloud-billing.png" alt="Billing cost">
</p>
<p>In one weekend Google Cloud had burned through €1,200 - which is roughly $1,500. </p>
<p>Scraperbox is bootstrapped so this was going to come out of my own pocket. And my money was already limited.</p>
<p>After the initial shock wore off I dove into the problem to fix it as quickly as possible. I was burning €17 an hour after all.</p>
<img src="https://scraperbox.com/img/blog/clouds.jpg" alt="Clouds">
<p><small>
Running on Cloud infastructure.
</small></p>
<h2 id="what-happened-">What happened?</h2>
<p>ScraperBox used to have a simple MySQL database. But, as the number of requests kept growing the database was struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>When our API reached 200K requests per hour we stood for a choice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy more RAM for the MySQL server</li>
<li>Switch over the Google Cloud Firestore.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to try out the Firestore, and on paper, it sounded amazing: an unlimited scalable database.</p>
<p>I started building and within a few days, ScraperBox was running on top of Google Firestore.</p>
<p>I wished now that I would have looked better at the pricing page of the Firestore database.</p>
<h2 id="the-firestore-pricing-model">The Firestore pricing model</h2>
<p>The pricing model is pretty simple. You pay $0.036 per 100K document reads and $0.108 per 100K document writes.</p>
<p>So, if you have 1M records and you do a <code>SELECT ALL</code> query it will cost you <code>$0.036 * 10 = $0.36</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's do some calculations to see how much our API would theoretically cost.</p>
<p>For each request, the API will check if there are concurrent requests running. The pseudo-query looks something like this.</p>
<pre><code>COUNT api_requests <span>WHERE</span> active=<span>true</span> <span>AND</span> user=CURRENT_USER
</code></pre><p>On average this will return <strong>5 documents</strong>. </p>
<p>Also, for each API request <strong>4 writes</strong> are done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new pending API request document.</li>
<li>Set the status to active.</li>
<li>Set the status to completed.</li>
<li>Increment the user API request counter.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, for each API request on average 5 read operations and 4 write operations are performed.</p>
<p>The million-dollar question is of course, how much does each API request cost using Google Firestore?</p>
<pre><code>Cost <span>of</span> <span>a</span> single <span>read</span>:  R = $<span>0.00000036</span>
Cost <span>of</span> <span>a</span> single <span>write</span>: W = $<span>0.00000108</span>

Cost <span>of</span> <span>an</span> API request: 
<span>5</span> * R + <span>4</span> * W = $<span>0.00000612</span>
</code></pre><p>That number seems pretty small. But we still have to multiply it with the 200K requests per hour coming through.</p>
<pre><code><span>200</span>,<span>000</span> * $<span>0.00000612</span> = $<span>1.224</span> per hour
</code></pre><p>when I saw that number I was confused. That amounted to roughly $30 per day. That was nowhere near the $500 google was billing me.</p>
<h2 id="the-misconfiguration-">The "misconfiguration"</h2>
<p>This is where I really messed up.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/">Google Data Studio</a>. If you don't know it, it allows you to build cool dashboards.</p>
<p>There was a problem though, you couldn't select Firestore as your data source. So, I needed to sync all the data between BigQuery and the Firestore.</p>
<p>Me being naive and not knowing the pricing structure simply decided to do the following.</p>
<pre><code>Every <span>5</span> minutes:
  <span>1.</span> Clear BigQuery <span>table</span>
  <span>2.</span> Select ALL documents from the Firestore
  <span>3.</span> Write them to the BigQuery <span>table</span>.
</code></pre><p>Every 5 minutes I would read all documents from the Firestore.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this collection grew with 200K documents per hour. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://scraperbox.com/img/blog/google-cloud-cost-graph.png" alt="Cost graph">
<small>My costs were going up exponentially</small>
</p>
<p>After figuring this out I bashed my head on the table a few times.</p>
<p>Then, I quickly deleted the Firestore database. Spun up a $30 a month MySQL server, and it's been running withouth a problem ever since.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>
<p>I thought of Google Cloud as a silver bullet. On paper, it sounded great, a super scalable database.</p>
<p>But I learned an expensive lesson that it's really important to choose the right technology for the job. My read and write-intensive operations weren't a good fit for the Firestore pricing model. </p>
<p>And to be completely fair a large part of my decision-making was influenced by the thought: "Firestore is new and cool, let's use that."</p>
<p>I won't be making that mistake quickly again.</p>
<p>That's it. I hope you enjoyed this story, happy coding! 👨‍💻</p>

<p>Here come the regulators. “Big Tech” companies like Facebook and Google definitely deserve some guide-rails, as well as some consequences for the unwanted impacts they have foisted on society along with the desirable ones. Facebook in particular has some deep, serious consequences of its amorality due soon. But so far, pretty much every regulation relating to the digital realm is defective. </p>



<p>For example the GDPR takes the best of intentions around citizen privacy and ends up causing unintended harm by layering ambiguous and extensive responsibilities and liabilities on small businesses and individuals with web presence. They either comply at great cost (relative to their turnover) or ignore it all, intentionally or out of bewilderment. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, well-resourced transnational corporations use their existing staffs to comply at a cost that’s effectively small change to them.  The result is the local companies suffer higher costs and risk while the behemoths treat it as just another minor global cost. This “friendly fire effect” is evident throughout the regulatory landscape – see <a href="https://edri.org/press-release-eu-terrorism-regulation-an-eu-election-tactic/">the EU Terrorism Regulation</a> for example, or the accidental hit on non-content industries like software when the European Copyright Directive draft was released (fortunately <a href="https://openforumeurope.org/open-source-software-saved-from-the-copyright-directive/">patched up in the final text</a>).</p>



<p>While the targets of much of this bad legislation are indeed those US new-wave corporations, the actual victims are repeatedly the Europeans who are our best hope of countering this US corporate power; citizen-innovators. Far from gutting Google’s guns and foiling Facebook’s finagling, the new rules give them and their peers unintended power over European innovators. </p>



<h2>Hammers To Crack Nuts</h2>



<p>A root cause of many of the problems with British and European legislation regarding the Internet is a failure to recognise that, in the <a href="https://meshedinsights.com/2018/07/02/the-legislative-disconnect-of-the-meshed-society/">meshed society</a> it creates, the <em>citizen</em> can play roles previously reserved for the corporation. I can create published works, I can directly fund new ventures, I can build global-scale applications (or at least be a critical link in their supply chain) and so on. But current political thinking only understands me as either a spending unit or a labour unit.</p>



<p>Believing these and other capabilities to only be within the scope of corporations, legislation frequently fails to observe the impact of regulations on individuals and small businesses. Penalties are disproportionate because they assume corporate resources; recourse is onerous or absent because they assume a legal department is involved; restrictions are asymmetric because they assume targets are a fraction of a giant operation not the entirety of a small one. </p>



<p>Consequently, only well-resourced corporations can hope to fully comply — an exclusionary gift to the large and established players and a further smack in the face of small European innovators. Worse, the Byzantine complexity and special vocabulary of the regulations mean that legal hyenas running trolling operations like they did around copyright regulations are bound to be along Real Soon.</p>



<p>One final wrinkle is the system <em>is</em> well populated with representatives of rights-holder organisations and patent-dependent corporations, who use the opportunity of a policy vacuum to inject restrictions on the pesky “pirates” they blame for their own slow transition to the meshed economy. Consequently what regulations do appear with digital elements are weighed down with “checks and balances” to make sure legacy rights holders can still collect their rents.</p>



<h2>Missing So Unrepresented</h2>



<p>How did this happen? It’s in no small part because the <a href="https://meshedinsights.com/2018/07/02/the-legislative-disconnect-of-the-meshed-society/">anachronistic absence</a> of citizen-scale thinking from the legislative process means it consequently has no representation for citizen-innovators. Only organisational “stakeholders” — corporations, trade associations and special-interest groups — are included in the cycle of research, consultation and review through which every new instrument proceeds. Worse, the European native corporate voices who <em>are</em> consulted make things worse by advocating for IPR extremism to prop up their own flagging fortunes. Our current legislative worldview treats citizens only as consumers or workforce, never as stakeholders, so rarely even meaningfully alerts us to proposals let alone considers or consults us.</p>



<p>To make significant progress with any “Digital Charter” of the kind the UK government <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Where-is-the-UKs-digital-strategy">purports</a> to love or with the expansive digital agenda the European Commission is rushing, we first need to recognise that the Internet has created a meshed society of opportunity for all and not just a new market for the winners of the previous age to re-sell/rent their old goods and methods. Digital sovereignty is an excellent concept and goal, but shouldn’t citizen-innovators also be allowed to aspire? Until the legislators consult open source developers, self-published writers and musicians and other small-but-scaleable innovators, new rules targeting the Internet will only result in reinforced oligarchies. </p>

			<p><span>I</span>t’s 2050 and you’re due for your monthly physical exam. Times have changed, so you no longer have to endure an orifices check, a needle in your vein, and a week of waiting for your blood test results. Instead, the nurse welcomes you with, “The doctor will sniff you now,” and takes you into an airtight chamber wired up to a massive computer. As you rest, the volatile molecules you exhale or emit from your body and skin slowly drift into the complex artificial intelligence apparatus, colloquially known as Deep Nose. Behind the scene, Deep Nose’s massive electronic brain starts crunching through the molecules, comparing them to its enormous olfactory database. Once it’s got a noseful, the AI matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them and generates a printout of your health. Your human doctor goes over the results with you and plans your treatment or adjusts your meds.</p><p>That’s how Alexei Koulakov, a researcher at <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>, who studies how the human olfactory system works, envisions one possible future of our healthcare. A physicist turned neuroscientist, Koulakov is working to understand how humans perceive odors and to classify millions of volatile molecules by their “smellable” properties. He plans to catalogue the existing smells into a comprehensive artificial intelligence network. Once built, Deep Nose will be able to identify the odors of a person or any other olfactory bouquet of interest—for medical or other reasons. “It will be a chip that can diagnose or identify you,” Koulakov says. Scent uniquely identifies a person or merchandise, so Deep Nose can also help at the border patrol, sniffing travelers, cargo, or explosives. “Instead of presenting passports at the airport, you would just present yourself.” And doctor’s visits would become a breeze—literally.</p><figure data-alt="%20Zeldovich_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18139_66d83a2d2a6d2bd6265c95aa833b121b.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>ODOR &amp; HOOCH:</strong> Peer-reviewed studies show dogs can be trained to detect signature scents of diseases, including cancer and tuberculosis. But in the long run, a “sniffing” computer would be more economical and effective.</span><span>aswphotos / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>W</span>hat can one’s odor tell about one’s health? Apparently, a lot. “The information that can be picked up from the airborne molecules is amazingly rich,” says Dmitry Rinberg, also a former physicist and now a neurobiologist at New York University who collaborates with Koulakov on olfactory research. “It’s so informative that you can tell what kind of beer people drank at a bar last night.” Odor can reveal other things happening with the body, he adds. “So we are trying to use this information for odor-based diagnostic approaches.”</p><p>Recent research finds that many diseases, including cancer, tuberculosis, and Parkinson’s, can manifest themselves through volatile compounds that change the person’s scent. Our bodies release certain metabolites—products of our metabolic activities. Some of these molecules are volatiles and become part of our scent, or “odorprint.” When we become sick or start developing a disease, our metabolic processes start functioning differently, emitting different volatile molecules or mixtures of them, so our odorprint changes too. “These molecules carry information about our state of health,” Koulakov says. For example, patients with Parkinson disease produce an unusually high amount of sebum,<sup>1</sup> a waxy lipid-rich biofluid excreted by the sebaceous glands of the skin, which sensitive noses can detect. Deep Nose could grab this information from the thin air. That could allow physicians to detect disease sooner, easier, and perhaps avoid some invasive diagnostic procedures. “It would essentially revolutionize the diagnostics system,” Koulakov says.</p><blockquote><p>Deep Nose matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them.</p> </blockquote><p>Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicenna, and other physicians of ancient times used their noses as diagnostic tools. A wound with a nasty smell could mean it was infected. And bad breath signaled a host of ailments. Today, however, physicians don’t sniff their patients—because humans generally stink at smelling. In fact, we are worse than our ancestors. Our primate predecessors sported about 850 olfactory receptor types, but we retained only 350 functioning ones, which in various combinations allow us to smell an astronomical amount of odors. (The rest of them simply don’t work. “They are the remnants of our former glory,” Koulakov quips.) Meanwhile, dogs have about 850 receptor types and mice about 1,100 or 1,200, so they are capable of discerning a much greater variety of smells—including those produced by the malfunctions of our bodies.<br></p><p>Scientists now use that animal olfactory wealth to diagnose disease—with some documented success and peer-reviewed studies. Recently, a group of scientists from several research institutions presented their results of training three beagles to sniff patients’ blood samples and detect lung cancer cells in them with 97 percent accuracy.<sup>2</sup> A study published in <i>British Medical Journal</i> stated that dogs were able to detect colorectal cancer by smelling stool.<sup>3</sup> Another paper in <i>BMC Cancer</i> described dogs smelling out ovarian cancer.<sup>4</sup> And African giant pouched rats had been taught to work as “tuberculosis diagnosticians” in Sub-Saharan Africa, sniffing sputum samples from patients. Microscope detection accuracy can vary from about 20 to 80 percent. The rats’ noses helped improve detection by up to 44 percent.<sup>5</sup></p><div>

</div><p>But animal diagnosticians have their problems. First, they must be trained, and training large numbers of animals that don’t live very long is expensive, time-consuming, and somewhat futile. Plus, every time you’d want to add yet another disease scent to their analytic arsenal, you’d have to train all of them again. “The use of animals for actual diagnostics is very limited,” Rinberg says.</p><p>That led scientists to ponder the possibility of an electronic nose instead. It would be far more economical to build an artificial sniffer apparatus that wouldn’t die after a few years, with standard software that can be updated regularly across all the board. And that’s how Koulakov envisions Deep Nose—an electronic olfactory AI that can function as a nose that picks up scents and as a brain that interprets them. That, of course, is no easy feat. Deep Nose is modeled after the neuro-machinery of the human brain, but scientists have yet to figure out how the human brain identifies one scent from another.</p><p><span>B</span>iologically, the act of smelling is more complex and less understood than our ability to see. Recognizing a scent is a precise and intricate process in which chemistry, biology, and physics must play together in a synchronized concerto—whether you’re relishing the aroma of a rose or pinching your nose at a pile of dog poop.</p><p>Inside your nasal cavity, millions of olfactory neurons are waiting for the next smelly molecule to fly in. These neurons have microscopic finger-like protrusions called cilia, which float in the mucus covering the surface of the nasal epithelium. The neurons’ other ends, called axons, stretch upward, passing through special passages inside the skull all the way to the brain, leading to the region called the olfactory bulb, named so for its onion-like shape. When molecules fly into our nose, they bind to the cilia, and the neurons send this information to the olfactory bulb, which interprets it, resulting in our sensation of the smell. It would also pass these signals to the olfactory cortex, whose neuro-machinery would determine the quality and the concentration of the smells.</p><figure data-alt="%20Zeldovich_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18140_9b5af8696030810f396c315b9577ffd0.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SIGHT OF SMELL:</strong> This image shows a rodent’s brain as it smells Methyl valerate.

Darker red colors correspond to more activity.</span><span>Courtesy of Dr. Hiro Nalkayama, Rinberg Lab, NYU Neuroscience Institute</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some molecules bind to certain receptors but not to others. Depending on the specific combination of receptors the molecules lock onto, we would smell roses or dog poop. But even that seemingly simple molecular handshake remains mysterious. Some scientists believe in the “steric binding theory,” which states that the molecules fit receptors’ distinct physical shapes. Others support the “vibrational theory” that purports that olfactory receptors detect the molecules’ vibrational frequency and “translate” them into odors. “The steric theory suggests that there is a binding pocket of a particular shape, and some molecules will fit there, while others may swim away in the mucus,” Koulakov says.<br></p><p>Regardless of which theory proves correct, Deep Nose builders still face a huge challenge. The nose part, which would mimic the neuronal binding action, will require chemical sensors. These sensors will interact with the flying molecules—whether by binding or a different method—and detect their presence. The sensors will then send electrical signals to the electronic brain—the Deep Nose network that will interpret what molecules have been detected. Koulakov envisions it functioning as a network of multiple layers that will be able to recognize different parts of the molecules and different chemical groups within them—just like different neurons react to the presence of different molecules inside biological brains.</p><blockquote><p>Dogs have been taught to smell cancer and rats have been taught to work as “tuberculosis diagnosticians.”</p> </blockquote><p>Luckily, researchers can see how that neuronal activity happens inside living brains. Modern technology allows one to peek inside the brain, seeing what olfactory receptors activate in response to what odors. That requires brain surgery and genetic manipulation, so it’s not possible to do in people, but …</p></div></div>

<p>Currently, there are two animation techniques that are commonly used on the web:
CSS transitions/animations and animating through JavaScript by modifying inline
styles.</p>
<h3 id="css-transitions-and-animations">CSS transitions and animations</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS transitions</a>
are a basic but powerful way to define a transition between two CSS states of a
DOM element. They provide limited control, but due to their simplicity it's
often the preferred way to implement basic animations like hover effects on a
button. Transitions happen automatically between values of a CSS attribute with
a given timing function, delay and duration.</p>
<pre><code><span>.my-button</span> {
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
  <span>transition</span>: opacity <span>0.3s</span> linear;
}

<span>.my-button</span><span>:hover</span> {
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span>;
}</code></pre><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS animations</a>
offer more control over timing and easing. They can run for a given duration,
have a delay and an iteration count. The animation itself is specified with
keyframes allowing the creation of more complicated animation effects that are
not possible with CSS transitions. CSS animations are usually triggered by
adding or removing a CSS class to an element with JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>@keyframes</span> fade-in-keyframes {
  0% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>0</span>;
  }
  50% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.2</span>;
  }
  100% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span>;
  }
}

<span>.fade-in</span> {
  <span>animation</span>: fade-in-keyframes <span>0.3s</span> linear;
}</code></pre><p>Both of these offer JavaScript events like <code>animationend</code> which allow you to
react to an animation that finished, though it can still be hard to synchronize
animations with application state due to the way animations have to be started.
They are a powerful, declarative and performant way to do animations on
individual elements.</p>
<h3 id="animating-with-javascript">Animating with JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript based animation loops are the status quo for doing complex
animations. Animation libraries like
<a href="https://ember-animation.github.io/ember-animated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ember-animated</a> and
<a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framer-motion</a> or older libraries like
<a href="http://velocityjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velocity.js</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script.aculo.us</a> are built around
this technique.</p>
<p>With a JavaScript based animation loop there is full control over timing and
state. This makes it possible to take other elements into account. For example,
you could take measurements of an element A and animate an element B from the
position and size of element A to element B's natural position.</p>
<p>A basic animation loop takes a source and target state and based on a timing
function calculate what the state for the current frame should be.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> sourceOpacity = <span>0</span>;
<span>let</span> targetOpacity = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> duration = <span>500</span>;

<span>let</span> startTime;
<span><span>function</span> <span>step</span>(<span>time</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (!startTime) {
    startTime = time;
  }

  <span>let</span> progress = time - startTime;

  
  <span>let</span> factor = <span>Math</span>.min(progress / duration, <span>1</span>);

  
  <span>let</span> currentOpacity = sourceOpacity + (targetOpacity - sourceOpacity) * factor;

  
  element.style.opacity = currentOpacity;

  
  <span>if</span> (progress &lt; duration) {
    <span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
}


<span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(step);</code></pre><p>In the past, animation loops with JavaScript had to be done through
<code>setInterval</code> to get an approximate 60 frames per second animation. Nowadays the
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API exists which results in smoother animation as the
browser will call it right before the next repaint. Browsers can also pause
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code> when a tab is out of focus to prevent inactive tabs from
running expensive animations at high framerates.</p>
<p>In addition, this animation technique requires the need for manual interpolation
of the values we might want to animate. This can be difficult for complex values
like <code>color</code> or <code>clipPath</code>, yet also gives opportunity to do different kinds of
interpolation than what the browser does by default, which can be especially
relevant for non-trivial values like a color space.</p>
<p>While this animation technique is very powerful it does result in a lot of
calculations being made every frame for the duration of the animation. This
might result in stutter or delay especially if something else is happening on
the page. Examples are a router transition to another page or some data fetching
and parsing. The browser also has limited ways to optimise such animations as it
only knows about the current frame and cannot completely offload the animation
to the GPU.</p>
<h2 id="web-animations-api">Web Animations API</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Animations API</a> is a relatively new addition to the browser and is
still very much in development. It promises to combine the benefits of CSS
Transitions/Animations and JavaScript based animations.</p>
<p>All popular browsers have now implemented the minimum features necessary to do
complex animations and a
<a href="https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polyfill</a> which adds
support for the Web Animations API to older browsers is available. It's time we
tried it out!</p>
<h3 id="the-basics">The basics</h3>
<p>The main interface for Web Animations is the <code>Element.animate</code> function. It can
be called on a DOM Element, takes an array of keyframes as the first argument
and options as the second argument. On first sight the API is very similar to
CSS animations.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"circle"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"text/javascript"</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>let</span> element = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'circle'</span>);
  <span>let</span> animation = element.animate([{ <span>opacity</span>: <span>0</span> }, { <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span> }], {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>300</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
  });
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>We'll need only a "from" and a "to" keyframe for now. The easing we set will
define the timing function used to interpolate between the keyframes. For now,
we will use the most basic one: "linear".</p>
<p>In addition to that there's some useful timing related functionality on the
animation instance we can use.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> animation = element.animate(...);


animation.pause();


<span>let</span> timing = animation.effect.getComputedTiming();


timing.progress;


animation.play();


animation.finished.then(<span>() =&gt;</span> { ... });</code></pre><p>With these building blocks we can start creating more complex animations.</p>
<h3 id="moving-an-element-around">Moving an element around</h3>
<p>Let's create an animation which applies a CSS transform to move the element from
one position to another.</p>
<pre><code>element.animate(
  [{ <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(0)'</span> }, { <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(100px)'</span> }],
  {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
  },
);</code></pre><p>This will transform the element 100 pixels to the right from its original
position in 1 second with a linear timing function. When the animation is done,
its effects on the element are automatically removed.</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video1.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation</video></figure><p>Like with CSS animations we need to specify a fill option to specify in what way
we want the animation's effects to be retained. We can specify <code>fill: forwards</code>
so our final state is retained.</p>
<pre><code>element.animate(
  [{ <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(0)'</span> }, { <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(100px)'</span> }],
  {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
    <span>fill</span>: <span>'forwards'</span>,
  },
);</code></pre><p>Our animation now behaves as we would expect and retains the styles specified in
the final keyframe.</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video2.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation that retains final state</video></figure><p>Alternatively the <code>animation.commitStyles()</code> feature can be used to put the
current animation state in the DOM as inline styles. The animation itself can
then safely be cancelled so the browser can free up the resources it consumes.</p>
<h3 id="cancelling-and-resuming-an-animation">Cancelling and resuming an animation</h3>
<p>Cancellation is an important part of real-world animations. Animations take time
to complete and in that time the user might have interacted with the page in a
way where the running animation does not make sense anymore. In most cases when
an animation is interrupted, another animation will be started. This could be
the same animation in reverse or an entirely different one. In any case we will
want to start the animation from the element's current state.</p>
<p>In theory, you only need to specify a "to" keyframe which would make it trivial
to cancel an animation as the browser will calculate the "from" position based
on the current state. Unfortunately not all browsers currently support that
behaviour meaning we'll have to be a little more elaborate for now.</p>
<p>In order to cancel the current animation (if any) we'll need to take a few
steps. Before trying to calculate our starting keyframe we'll need to pause the
currently running animation (if any). Then we'll need to get the current
transform present on our element. Finally, we can start the new animation.</p>
<p>Let's abstract our animation into a <code>move</code> function which takes <code>transformStart</code>
and <code>transformEnd</code> string arguments. We'll also add <code>animateRight</code> and
<code>animateLeft</code> functions which are hooked up to two buttons, so we can run the
animations by clicking those buttons.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>onclick</span>=<span>"animateLeft()"</span>&gt;</span>Left<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>onclick</span>=<span>"animateRight()"</span>&gt;</span>Right<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"circle"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>const</span> element = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'circle'</span>);

  <span>let</span> currentAnimation;

  <span><span>function</span> <span>move</span>(<span>transformStart, transformEnd</span>) </span>{
    currentAnimation = element.animate(
      [{ <span>transform</span>: transformStart }, { <span>transform</span>: transformEnd }],
      {
        <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
        <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
        <span>fill</span>: <span>'forwards'</span>,
      },
    );
  }

  <span><span>function</span> <span>animateRight</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    move(<span>'translateX(0)'</span>, <span>'translateX(100px)'</span>);
  }

  <span><span>function</span> <span>animateLeft</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    move(<span>'translateX(100px)'</span>, <span>'translateX(0)'</span>);
  }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>Rapidly clicking the buttons interchangeably now shows a pretty jarring
animation!</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video3.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation</video></figure><p>This is a good time to take a look at the developer tools to find out what's
going on. Note that you will not see the animated styles appear in the DOM as
you might be used to with JavaScript based animation. You can see the effect
they have in the computed styles and animation sections of the browser's
developer tools.</p>
<p>From the "Animations" pane we can slow down the animation to 25% of the original
speed to make it easier to see what is going on. We can also replay previous
animations. When we click the "Left" button while the animation is happening
we'll see that the animation is not starting at the correct point.</p>

obviously an incorrect starting point if we interrupt the animation in the
middle.</p>
<p>We can fix this by first pausing the animation. Next we can utilise the global
<code>getComputedStyle(element)</code> function to retrieve the current styles for our
element. We'll take the computed <code>transform</code> style as the starting point for our
keyframe. After doing this we …</p></div></div>

<p>This essay is inspired by the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness">Factfulness</a> where the key idea explored is that the world has witnessed significant progress over the last few decades, but most people are unaware of that fact because they hold distorted views.</p>

<p>Talking of distorted views, to get a sense of how much do you know about the world, I highly recommend taking <a href="https://upgrader.gapminder.org/">this quiz</a>. Hans Rosling, the author of the book, had been quizzing thousands of people across the world and most of them (including Nobel laureates) performed worse than random chance on such questions.</p>

<p>For example, most people overestimate the percentage of the human population living in extreme poverty (which is defined as having an income of less than $2/mo).  It’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview">10%</a> (as of 2017) but even the most educated people get it wrong. </p>

<p>People don’t just get the latest facts wrong but they get the trend wrong as well. Many indicators such as extreme poverty, child mortality rate, babies per family have been rapidly improving across the world.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="616" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/extreme-poverty-trend1-1024x616-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/extreme-poverty-trend1-1024x616-1.png 1024w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/extreme-poverty-trend1-1024x616-1-300x180.png 300w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/extreme-poverty-trend1-1024x616-1-768x462.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Via <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/extreme-poverty-trend/">Gapminder</a></figcaption></figure>

<h3>How does this knowledge matter?</h3>

<p>Well, it matters because your decisions based on wrong facts are likely to be wrong. The knowledge that extreme poverty has not been rising but rather is rapidly falling across the world gives you an entirely different emotional and rational <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/free-book-mental-models-for-startup-founders/">framework</a> to live your life by.</p>

<p>One of the phrases I loved from the book is that <strong>things can be bad <em>and </em>better</strong>. Bad in the sense that even 10% extreme poverty is nothing to celebrate about, but better in the sense that just a few decades ago, this figure was 50%. </p>

<p>In other words, you can hold both these thoughts simultaneously in your head: a) billions of people have escaped extreme poverty in recent times; b) hundreds of millions of people are still living in extreme poverty. </p>

<p>Remember: things can be bad <em>and</em> better.</p>

<h3>Why do we hold distorted views?</h3>

<p>Believing wrong facts is mostly due to our <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/hacks-to-avoid-cognitive-biases/">cognitive biases</a>, which are hard-wired into us by <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/evolution-explains-everything/">evolution</a>. For example, we tend to pay a lot of attention to negative news. The ruffling in the bushes is likely just wind, but it pays to assume that it’s a tiger because in rare chance it is, your wrong belief will save your life.</p>

<p>This is why news also is overwhelmingly negative and attention-grabbing. No journalist would report the slow, steady but usually invisible progress such as the reduction in extreme poverty but they’d report one-off big-bang events such as airplane crashes.</p>

<p>Talking of airplane crashes, did you know that the deaths from airplane accidents have been rapidly falling down for decades now?</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="527" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plane-crashes-1024x527.png" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plane-crashes-1024x527.png 1024w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plane-crashes-300x154.png 300w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plane-crashes-768x395.png 768w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plane-crashes.png 1462w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Via <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/plane-accidents/">Gapminder</a>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The next time you hear panic-inducing news from an airplane crash, try recalling the chart above. While even a single death in an accident is tragic, it may give you comfort knowing that accidents have become less and less frequent over time.</p>

<p>Remember: <strong>If airplane crashes were as common as say traffic accidents, they won’t make headlines.</strong></p>

<h3>So, is the world becoming better?</h3>

<p>I’ve explored this theme of progress in several of my previous essays:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://invertedpassion.com/making-peace-with-the-ambiguity-of-progress/">Making peace with the ambiguity of progress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://invertedpassion.com/why-are-we-rich-but-hopeless/">Why are we rich but hopeless</a></li>
<li><a href="https://invertedpassion.com/what-does-the-soul-of-the-marionette-say/">What does the soul of the Marionette say?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This book helped me formalize what progress means from an individual’s point of view. The idea is pretty simple. Imagine there are two people in the world Alice and Bob. Both of them have a different amount of things available in the world. Say Bob has 1 apple and 2 units of free time, while Alice has no apples and 4 units of time. </p>

<p>We can say that the potential for progress exists if Alice will happily switch what she has (no apples, 4 units of time) with what Bob has (1 apple, 2 units of time) but the reverse isn’t something that Bob would want. </p>

<p>As a concrete example, someone living in extreme poverty with no shoes will happily upgrade to having shoes, but the reverse isn’t true (you wouldn’t replace your shoes with no shoes willingly).</p>

<p>Thus human <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/why-do-businesses-exist/">desires</a> create the potential for progress and if more humans are satisfying more of their desires, we can say that the world is getting better. Looking from this angle, the book presents a ton of data (which you can also access on <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/">their website</a>) suggesting more people now satisfying more of their desires. </p>

<p>However, there are several big and important qualifications to this view of world getting better.</p>

<h4>#1 If the world is getting better, why aren’t we happier?</h4>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="728" height="546" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2010-norgard-amateur-econ-barcelona-5-728.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2010-norgard-amateur-econ-barcelona-5-728.jpg 728w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2010-norgard-amateur-econ-barcelona-5-728-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></figure>

<p>At least in rich nations, per capita income has grown and yet reported happiness levels have been more or less stable. Why is that so?</p>

<p>I think the conception of progress gives an answer to this riddle. While we definitely are satisfying more and more of our needs over time, our desires do not seem to have limits. For example, escaping extreme poverty is definitely progress and nobody would want to swap their situation with an extremely poor person. But it is also true that once someone has escaped poverty, there’s always someone richer that they can swap their situation with.</p>

<p>So, looking from an individual’s trajectory, there’s progress if an individual wouldn’t swap their present situation with their past situation. And this is the case with nations. Most of them wouldn’t prefer to go back in history when the majority of their population was living under extreme poverty.</p>

<p>But looking from a comparative point of view, there’s no progress because everyone else is progressing too and when you assess your happiness, you assess mostly relative to others (and not to your past self). </p>

<p>In short, earlier you were unhappy because you couldn’t afford a decent meal. Now, you’re unhappy because you couldn’t afford an international trip.</p>

<h4>#2 What cost are we paying for making the world better?</h4>

<p>Look at the charts below. Human life expectancy has increased steadily over the last century.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="602" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-1024x602.png" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-1024x602.png 1024w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-300x176.png 300w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-768x451.png 768w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-1536x903.png 1536w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1-1560x917.png 1560w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lex1.png 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Via <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/life-expectancy/">Gapminder</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>But at the same time we’ve lost <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/weve-lost-60-of-wildlife-in-less-than-50-years/">60% of wildlife in the last 50 years</a>.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="438" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/large_gLwVvzWJcXoCgBr4EE75yEO0Ux-I-a7ROlKNIW_l9Nw.png" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/large_gLwVvzWJcXoCgBr4EE75yEO0Ux-I-a7ROlKNIW_l9Nw.png 850w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/large_gLwVvzWJcXoCgBr4EE75yEO0Ux-I-a7ROlKNIW_l9Nw-300x155.png 300w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/large_gLwVvzWJcXoCgBr4EE75yEO0Ux-I-a7ROlKNIW_l9Nw-768x396.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"><figcaption>Via <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/weve-lost-60-of-wildlife-in-less-than-50-years/">WEF</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>If we measure progress only from a human point of view, increased life expectancy is good news. But if we account for all living beings or all conscious beings, it seems their average life expectancy has gone down drastically. (Yes, I know we’re farming animals for meat but if such animals could speak, they’d tell you that they rather be in the wild and not dead than in captivity and waiting to be murdered).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no consensus on how worthy is a non-human life so doing this calculus to find out net progress comes down to individual preference. </p>

<p>This perhaps suggests that the answer to the question of whether the world is getting better is a philosophical one, rather than a factual one.</p>

<h4>#3 What if the world becomes better before it becomes worse?</h4>

<p>It’s true that the number of people dying in global conflicts and wars has been reducing ever since World War II.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="632" src="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/battle-deaths-1024x632.png" alt="" srcset="https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/battle-deaths-1024x632.png 1024w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/battle-deaths-300x185.png 300w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/battle-deaths-768x474.png 768w, https://invertedpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/battle-deaths.png 1456w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Via <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/topics/deaths-in-wars/">Gapminder</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>But that’s purely because we haven’t had a major war since then. There’s no guarantee that we wouldn’t have another major war in the future. What we know for sure is that we now have potentially more devastating technology than before. As technology progresses, we keep inventing new ways to kill. From deadly pathogens to fusion bombs to autonomous weapons. Today, we have it all.</p>

<p>Yes, the world has been relatively safe but it’s also more <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12718">vulnerable for destruction</a> than ever. Between climate change, AI, nuclear holocaust, financial collapse, pandemics, we have many potential ways to break progress trends and reset human progress.</p>

<p>In summary, the answer to the question “is the world becoming better” totally depends on what aspect of the world you’re referring to. </p>

<p>Some things are becoming better, others are becoming worse.</p>

<h3>Alright then, what does become better with time?</h3>

<p>Knowledge.</p>

<p>Even though there’s a future risk that human progress can be reset, one thing we know for sure is that knowledge once discovered remains accessible for exploitation and further compounding. In this sense, one trend in progress we can confidently assert should be our gains in knowledge.</p>

<p>Our knowledge that the Earth rotates around the sun and not vice versa is something that will persist. Anyone in the future who doesn’t believe that is simply going to get out-competed by the ones who believe it. Flat Earthers can believe whatever they want to believe but they won’t make profits sending satellites into space.</p>

<p>That’s why I feel comfort in knowing that one aspect the world has definitely gotten better at is that, as a collective, we know more than we knew before and as individuals, we have the opportunity to know more than ever before.</p>

<p>Today, a dedicated physics grad student can know more than Albert Einstein knew in his lifetime. That’s magical and worth celebrating!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>I</h3><p>Are we less eccentric than we used to be?</p><p>The thought started from a <a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1356195647729389570">Twitter exchange</a> recently. The prior credence that seemed to exist was that somehow we're living in an age of mediocrity. An era where the Great Persons of history or Great Works of history didn't exist any longer, or at least only existed sporadically.</p><blockquote><p>If you take a random sample of the important movers and shakers of 18th and 19th century Britain and compare them to 21st century America the biographies of the former are far more interesting, their pet projects far bolder and more creative.</p></blockquote><p>There's also the persistent myth that this is why we're just not accomplishing much.</p><blockquote><p>People like Musk are the exception today, in the age of Rockefeller they were the rule...</p></blockquote><p>But can it be true? What we know of Rockefeller comes from a historical lens that's more than a century removed. What we know of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk comes from minute-by-minute updates published with no filter.</p><p>The older generation had Howard Hughes, but we have Elon Musk. Yes Hughes went nutty and used to store his pee in bottles, but Musk sincerely believes we can become AI-human hybrids who live on Mars. So that’s a tie. </p><p>There was an exploration by <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2021/01/where-have-all-great-works-gone.html">Scholars Stage</a> that looked at an adjacent phenomenon. At many a time in human history, you could pretty easily name those writers who are destined to become classics. The punchline made in the article (though you should go read the whole thing) is that we have homogenised our culture enough that we're stuck and stagnant.</p><blockquote><p>In a world in which American culture is so dominant yet so sterile it is difficult for genuinely fresh developments abroad to arise. For three decades we have had our universal empire and all the intellectual rigidity that comes with it.</p></blockquote><p>There seems to be a huge amount of both recency bias and salience bias present in these assertions. But it's a belief held widely enough that it's worth figuring out if it's fair.</p><h3>II</h3><p>Let's take a first glance, trusting in the all seeing Google to see if we can see anything useful. Each of the three below are results when you search for notable folks.</p><p><strong>Notable 18th century people</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a10d406-9595-440d-b101-6f81aec931ca_1214x320.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a10d406-9595-440d-b101-6f81aec931ca_1214x320.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a10d406-9595-440d-b101-6f81aec931ca_1214x320.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;width&quot;:1214,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><strong>Notable 19th century people</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feefa619c-7a6b-49ab-8335-e35c38fee24e_1399x336.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feefa619c-7a6b-49ab-8335-e35c38fee24e_1399x336.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eefa619c-7a6b-49ab-8335-e35c38fee24e_1399x336.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:336,&quot;width&quot;:1399,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Because Charles Dickens snuck in above for unknown reasons, I added an extra for this century.

But we also have our eccentrics here. There's Elon Musk who wants us to become spacefaring human-AI hybrids, Bezos who can basilisk-stare entire industries, Peter Thiel who's a well known genius + oceanic vampire, Jack who runs two companies equally absently from a Polynesian island, Bill Gates solving all of the world's problems, an anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and more.</p><p>There's also the true counterparts of PT Barnum, like Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos and Trevor Milton from Nikola.</p><p>It's just not clear to me that we're living in a world of "elite sheep" where the lack of talent or drive is our main issue. I repeat from above, someone invented the future of money <em><strong>and we have no idea who that is still.</strong></em></p><p>The one change that's worth mentioning is that we have much fewer eccentric world leaders, for the simple reason that a) there's much lesser looting and pillaging and conquering which appeals to a particular type of young man, and b) there's much fewer really rich people born into wealth with no legal or societal guardrails, helping them become as crazy as possible.</p><p>But maybe we're unfairly looking only at recent history. Let's go back in time to the Victorian ages. Do we have the equivalent of Lord Byron? For exploring we have Sir Ranulph Fiennes. He doesn't get the same love I feel, but he definitely fits the explorer/ swashbuckler/ poet bill. And we have David Bowie, a poet and Romantic who <a href="https://theconversation.com/david-bowie-a-latter-day-romantic-was-a-modern-day-lord-byron-84319">became Ziggy Stardust</a>, an alien liberator.</p><p>We all fall somewhere on a bell curve that determines our abilities. Yet our exploits often follow a power law. It holds true for wealth, for accomplishment, for scientific discoveries and genius. And in the days when the status-bar for who all you knew was barbell-shaped, where you knew your locals and also knew the King, very few people broke out.</p><p>Feels weird to think somehow we're immune to those pressures and have become fully conformist in a weirdly unspecifiable way. That can't be true, can it?</p><h3>III</h3><p>Channelling <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamasNemesis/status/1356268127378698240">Twitter</a> again:</p><blockquote><p>Which I'd argue is a key reason why so much was accomplished in the age of Rockefeller. An elite of "excellent sheep" might be able to make incremental improvements, but won't be able or willing to introduce genuine novelty. As it turns out that's more or less what we have...</p></blockquote><p>Of course in conflating eccentricities with elite success, this is one possible answer for Nicolas Bloom's idea of why ideas are getting harder to find. I can't reconcile it with the fact people are claiming this is true despite a) the better tech we have, b) the better IQs we have, and c) the increased population we have. So if we're smarter, more capable and there's just more of us, surely we can't have become <em>less</em> interesting or able to generate novel insights. Solving all those needs a systemic answer, not a talent based one.</p><p>But what if we took a slightly different tack and start looking at a few examples, randomly chosen, to see what the average idea of an eccentric is.</p><ul><li><p>Sir Tatton Sykes: A perfect British aristocrat, living in the late 19th century, who hated flowers with a consuming passion. He'd smash them when he saw one, and he also forbid his tenants in Yorkshire from growing the "nasty untidy things". In case that wasn't sufficient, as a replacement, he suggested cauliflowers. He also apparently used to buy coats in multiple sizes, to wear one atop another, so that he could take it off when he got hot or put them on when he got cold. To be honest, this sounds like genius to me!</p></li><li><p>Sir Ranulph Fiennes: A British explorer in the 20th century. He conducted expeditions to the South Pole, the North Pole and crossed Antarctica on foot. He circumnavigated around the world along its polar axis, and climbed the highest mountain on all seven continents. He climbed Mt Everest at age 65. He's also a pretty amazing author (you have to read The Feather Men), and a pretty good poet.</p></li><li><p>Lord Byron: He travelled the world and fought in the Greek War of Independence. He was bisexual, which he managed to hide reasonably badly. He was a politician, advocate of social reform and against the death penalty, which took some standing in those days. He was a philosopher and a fantastic poet. He also fathered Ada Lovelace, a foundational figure in the field of computer programming.</p></li><li><p>Alexander Thynn, Marquess of Bath: Among other amazing features, he lives in a safari park, decorated the rooms of his home with Kama Sutra paintings himself, and had 75 "wifelets" living in cottages on his estate. Need we say more?</p></li><li><p>Simon Norton: Mathematician in Cambridge, who at one point was called the greatest English mathematician since Newton. He worked with John Conway creating several discoveries related to finite groups and related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. He was also obsessed with buses, spending most of his time later taking rides on buses all over England, fulfilling the public notion of what all mathematicians eventually become.</p></li><li><p>Other random selections: David Bowie, Walt Disney, Jane Goodall, Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain</p></li></ul><p>Politics and business are a little too easy, so I bucketed them together lest they overwhelm the results.</p><ul><li><p>Business: Rockefeller, Elon Musk, Howard Hughes, Jack Dorsey, Warren Buffet, Richard Branson, JP Morgan, Rothschild, Henry Ford</p></li><li><p>Politics: Kim Jong Un, Fidel Castro, Donald Trump, Nicolas Maduro, there's no shortage of weirdos in politics today. It does seem to be the case though that only dictators seem authorised to act crazy, which is also why the olden days seemed odder like King George IV or King Ludwig II of Bavaria.</p></li><li><p>Entertainment: This is where our era truly shines. We have Bjork and Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and, come on, Nicolas Cage. We even have Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol and a long enough array of rockers that most of their antics have passed from insane to barely noteworthy.</p></li></ul><p>We forget sometimes that when we see the most interesting or eccentric people in history oftentimes we're seeing a selection from a long time period, selected out through a long period.</p><p>While making the list and doing a bit of random selection there seemed to be two forces at work, biasing the analysis. One was that there's of course recency bias in most available sources - there's just more written about modern day notable people. And another, those notable gentlemen (they were mostly gentlemen) from the 18th and 19th centuries were spread over a remarkably large time period (well toughly two and half centuries by definition), making it an unfair comparison. Since both the biases pointed in opposite directions, I took their effect as a wash, though this is a caveat emptor sort of situation.</p><h3>IV</h3><p>There's a coda to this. What defines our civilisation in many ways is our conception of the Great Work. Shakespeare's sonnets. Newton's diaries and discovery of gravity. Einstein's e = mc2 equation that captures the cosmos in something so simple. Mozart's Magic Flute. Whether it's in science, literature or music, the Great Work is a constant.</p><p>Do we have anything comparable in the past half century?</p><p>Oswald Spengler, in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H8WX8S7/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">analysis of comparative world history</a> espouses the theory that all great cultures, us included, follow a similar arc. If you feel like it echoes Peter Turchin's theories of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since 2007, I’ve recorded my reading habits with goodreads. It’s always been a nice, simple place where I try to beat my old reading records and save reviews and ratings for future reference. I have few qualms with the site technically, but I’ve been reevaluating my presence on the internet and keeping a much closer eye on how my actions benefit AppAmaGooBookSoft - the Apple Amazon Google Facebook Microsoft oligopoly.</p><p>goodreads was acquired by Amazon in 2013, but haven’t made much of a deal about it: Amazon isn’t mentioned on their front page, ‘about us’ page - well, pretty much anywhere but the Jobs page, on which applicants will probably be surprised that they’ll be applying to a wing of Amazon.</p><h3 id="free-work">Free work</h3><p>I’m making more of a deal about this than it is: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> isn’t an evil company - they’re mostly sticking to their mission of cataloging books and connecting with readers. But still - when I read a book, contribute a rating, write a review, I’m essentially <em>working</em> for Amazon. I feel about it the same way I feel when I fill in a ReCAPTCHA - that ‘are you a robot’ form that was acquired by Google and now has you working to improve their machine learning and mapping systems.</p><p>Back when I was thinking about OpenStreetMap and ‘crowdsourcing’ more, the academic side referred to crowdsourcing as ‘volunteered geographic information’ - VGI, of course - which always felt weird to me. Perhaps it was just too accurate that what we see isn’t a commons in which the contributors are also the people getting the most value, but typically people donate their time and energy or are coerced to (ReCAPTCHA), and the entity deriving the most value is a corporation.</p><p>In this lens, sometimes I think about whether, instead of not <em>using</em> AppAmaGooBookSoft services for a day or a week, would it be possible to exist on the internet without <em>assisting</em> AppAmaGooBookSoft. Is it no longer possible to express a thought or contribute to the world’s knowledge without also training a TensorFlow model somewhere?</p><h3 id="hosting-it-myself">Hosting it myself</h3><p>Which is to say, I didn’t want to participate on goodreads anymore: I wanted to own my own reading history. Which, now, I do. There’s now a <a href="https://macwright.com/books/">‘books’</a> item in my header, and the first review I wrote on-site is <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/12/07/the-housing-monster.html">The Housing Monster</a>.</p><p>The technical details are pleasantly dull. I’m using Jekyll for this, like I do for the rest of the site, I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/tmcw/3e268886be83f25cd9728cc6f3bc4184">a simple bit of JavaScript</a> that translates between the goodreads CSV export and Jekyll-friendly YAML headers.</p><p>Book pages have a custom layout and style that embeds structured metadata. I’m iffy on the value of that metadata - whether <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>-style annotations have any value. Semantic web has a real religious bent to it that I don’t feel. I want to see the <em>implementations</em> and the full working <em>systems</em>, and I think it’s been long enoough since the introduction of RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD that we should be seeing practical, real uses of them. And I’m just not seeing those uses.</p><p>But it doesn’t hurt to throw some extra attributes on a page. It’ll be easier to scrape for the bots.</p><h3 id="todo">Todo</h3><p>I’d like to eventually support <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>: <em>Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</em>. I think that’s a really good strategy, and I don’t do it much yet - though I do consider <a href="https://tapiriik.com/">Tapiriik</a>, the service I use to sync my running data, to be a good example.</p><p>I’ve also been researching book numbers and writing a ‘universal ID translator’ service to generate all types of IDs - ISBN, EAN, OLID, OCLC, goodreads, ASIN, and so on, given one ID. This is mostly because for some of the books I’ve read, I’ve cited their eBook editions, and those don’t always have ISBN numbers.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p><span><strong>*GUEST POST by Moudhy Al-Rashid (see her bio <span><a href="https://papyrus-stories.com/guest-writers/">here</a></span>)</strong></span></p>

<p><span>The Neo-Assyrian physician Nabû-tabni-uṣurseems once upon a time for reasons we may never know to have fallen out of favour with the court. Unlike his colleagues, he no longer received compensation for his work. Payments promised by the court never materialised. Concern for his financial well-being and his position in the court snowballed into fear. Gripped by anxiety, he penned – or, rather, impressed – this letter to the king.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“To the king, my lord, your servant Nabû-tabni-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!</span></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>If the king, my lord, knows a fault made by me, let the king not keep my alive!</span></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>All my associates are happy, (and) I am dying of a broken heart. I have been treated as if I did not keep the watch of the king, my lord; my heart has become exceedingly troubled, heartbreak has seized me, I have become exceedingly afraid: may the king revive my heart before my colleagues!”&nbsp;</span><span>(ABL 525)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Found at Nineveh in the royal library and now housed in the British Museum (K. 590), the cuneiform tablet that carries these words provides a window onto a language for anxiety that overlaps with modern ways of framing worry, fear, and sorrow, a language that centres the heart, or Akkadian <em>libbu</em>,as an organ of thought and emotion. More specifically, a broken heart.</span></p>

<p><span>Our physician’s description organises his experience of heartbreak along the same lines as those found in contemporary therapeutic medical texts, a rich corpus of texts that describe illnesses and prescribe treatments, like this one from nearby Aššur:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“[If] he continually has heartbreak… in his bed he is continually afraid, he suffers paralysis up his form; toward god and king, his heart is filled (with anger), his limbs are poured out repeatedly, on repeated occasions he is afraid; day and night he does not sleep, he continually sees frightening dreams, he continually suffers paralysis; he has no desire for bread or beer; he forgets the words that he speaks.”&nbsp;(BAM 234)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Fear, paralysis, nightmares, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and forgetfulness are recorded as presenting with the condition labelled as heartbreak.</span></p>
<p><span>For anyone who has experienced anxiety, some of these symptoms might sound familiar. In modern biomedical models, anxiety is also described both in mental and physical terms. Adjectives that describe emotional states, like worried, afraid, and nervous, appear alongside descriptions like physical weakness, gastrointestinal problems, and a pounding heart to describe experiences associated with anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span>Symptoms of any illness are labelled according to socially available categories, and it seems that for a Neo-Assyrian physician, the vocabulary for this particular experience of mental distress has echoes in today’s world. And it seems that in the first millennium BCE, it was acceptable to admit, even to a king, that one was suffering emotional anguish.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the earliest known expressions of mental distress come from ancient Mesopotamia, where ancient scribes impressed into clay words that capture individual, collective, and historical experiences not just of anxiety, but of a whole spectrum of mental health issues, from depressed states to disorganised thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you ever you find yourself feeling anxious, remember Nabû-tabni-uṣur and his letter to a Neo-Assyrian king, and remember that you are not alone. These are ancient and human problems. They connect us to the past, and they connect us to each other.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	This time I implemented WebSocket support for 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	Soon came to realize that when implementing WebSockets from
	scratch there is no go-to-and-know-everything resource available
	on the internet. Most of the resources just use third-party
	libraries and don't show how to implement the underlying
	network protocol and frame parsing mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
	Also, reading the RFC is kinda tedious, so I'm trying my best to
	have enough code demos available for clarifications. This guide
	tries to cover everything when it comes to the current WS13
	network protocol, including reserved frames and how to support
	them in future.
</p>
<p>
	Most people will most likely use socket.io, but from my personal
	view I wouldn't recommend it. In my use cases I use WebSockets
	peer-to-peer (yes, you can, despite everybody else claiming no),
	and the whole dependency tree of socket.io is rather redundant
	than performant.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides
	are implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>WS13</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a> 
	and that there were a couple of legacy versions of Web Browsers around
	for a while that implemented the websocket protocol in a buggy manner.
</p>
<p>
	This is not the case anymore and I will completely ignore your shitty
	Safari from the dark ages here (it's 2019, not 2011 after all).
</p>
<p>
	The Web-Socket Protocol is a web protocol that uses HTTP's 
	 <code>Upgrade</code>
	mechanism in order to upgrade a connection. That means the first request
	to the server is actually an HTTP request with the 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	and 
	 <code>Upgrade: websocket</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	If the server has a specialized service-oriented architecture that
	needs more than just websocket data frames in order to work, it is
	good to implement it as a so-called sub protocol.
</p>
<p>These subprotocols can be used in the Web Browser, too.</p>
<pre>// Browser Example
let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:12345', [
	'me-want-cookies' // Sub-Protocol
]);

let data = JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' });
let blob = new Uint8Array(8);

socket.send(data); // Text Frame
socket.send(blob); // Binary Frame
</pre>
<h2>Web-Socket Server</h2>
<p>The demo will be implemented in modern node.js.</p>
<p>
	The server creation has to be done with the 
	 <code>net.Server()</code>
	 interface,
	as the data that we need to access is 
	 <code>raw TCP data</code>
	 and our library
	will have to support binary encodings.
</p>
<p>
	It is important that the TCP connection is modified to fit our needs
	in order to never timeout. The WS13 protocol uses a 
	 <code>Ping Frame</code>
	 and
	a 
	 <code>Pong Frame</code>
	 which we have to manage ourselves, so we need to tell
	the TCP networking stack that by setting 
	 <code>socket.allowHalfOpen</code>
	 to 
	 <code>true</code>
	and by calling 
	 <code>socket.setTimeout(0)</code>
	 and 
	 <code>socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0)</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	As node.js runs 
	 <code>libuv</code>
	 in the background, which is of asynchronous
	nature, we also have to make sure that everything gets send as soon
	as possible by calling 
	 <code>socket.setNoDelay(true)</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs
import net    from 'net';
import { WS } from './WS.mjs';


// Chapter: Opening Handshake
const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};
	return headers;

};

let server = new net.Server({
	allowHalfOpen:  true,
	pauseOnConnect: true
});

server.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {

	socket.on('data', (buffer) =&gt; {

		let headers = parse_opening_handshake(buffer);
		if (
			headers['connection'] === 'Upgrade'
			&amp;&amp; headers['upgrade'] === 'websocket'
			&amp;&amp; headers['sec-websocket-protocol'] === 'me-want-cookies'
		) {

			WS.upgrade(socket, headers, (result) =&gt; {

				if (result === true) {

					console.log('WS.upgrade() successful.');

					socket.allowHalfOpen = true;
					socket.setTimeout(0);
					socket.setNoDelay(true);
					socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0);

					socket.removeAllListeners('timeout');
					socket.removeAllListeners('data');

					socket.on('data', buffer =&gt; {

						WS.receive(socket, buffer, request =&gt; {
							console.log('Received request ', request);
						});

					});

				} else {

					console.error('WS.upgrade() unsuccessful.');
					console.error('Sorry, no HTTP allowed either, yo');

					socket.end();

				}

			});

		} else {

			console.error('Sorry, no TCP allowed, yo');

			socket.end();

		}

	});

	socket.on('error',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('close',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('timeout', () =&gt; socket.close());

	socket.resume();

});

server.on('error', () =&gt; server.close());
server.on('close', () =&gt; (server = null));

server.listen(12345, null);
</pre>
<h2>Opening Handshake</h2>
<p>
	The initial request that is done via HTTP is conform to 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	,
	so it is very easy to parse and the payload is encoded in 
	 <code>utf8</code>
	and not 
	 <code>binary</code>
	, which eases up the parsing process.
</p>
<p>
	The headers are - as every network byte ordered data - separated
	by 
	 <code>\r\n</code>
	 after each line, which means it's best to simply parse
	line-by-line and just trim everything off to have margin for
	malformed but recoverable handshakes.
</p>
<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cookie.engineer
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: http://localhost:12345
Sec-WebSocket-Key: bm9tbm9tCg==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</pre>
<p>
	The header parsing mechanism for 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	 is quite easy,
	as it's just utf8 encoded data that has a trailing 
	 <code>\r\n\r\n</code>
	following its headers section.
</p>
<p>
	Fragmented frames always have this, but you never know what
	kind of script kiddie is challenging your server - so it's
	good to have a failsafe parsing mechanism in place.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs

const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};

	let req = buffer.toString('utf8');
	let raw = req.split('\n').map((line) =&gt; line.trim());

	if (raw[0].includes('HTTP/1.1')) {

		raw.slice(1).filter((line) =&gt; line.trim() !== '').forEach((line) =&gt; {

			let key = line.split(':')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
			let val = line.split(':').slice(1).join(':').trim();

			headers[key] = val;

		});

	}

	return headers;

};
</pre>
<h2>Connection Upgrade</h2>
<p>
	After the initial Opening Handshake request, it's expected to send
	the handshake verification back to the client.
</p>
<p>
	The handshake response contains the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</code>
	 header
	and the 
	 <code>Upgrade: WebSocket</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	 as well.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it is good to let the client know which protocol
	we are expecting (so that mismatches can be handled automatically)
	by sending the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies</code>
	 and
	the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the 
	 <code>nonce</code>
	 salt for the reply is static and is the
	utf8 value 
	 <code>258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// WS.mjs
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
import crypto     from 'crypto';



const WS = {};


WS.upgrade = (socket, headers, callback) =&gt; {

	headers  = headers instanceof Object    ? headers  : null;
	callback = callback instanceof Function ? callback : null;

	if (headers !== null) {

		let nonce = headers['sec-websocket-key'] || null;
		if (nonce !== null) {

			let hash   = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(nonce + '258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11').digest('hex');
			let accept = Buffer.from(hash, 'hex').toString('base64');
			let blob   = [];

			blob.push('HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake');
			blob.push('Upgrade: WebSocket');
			blob.push('Connection: Upgrade');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Accept: ' + accept);
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13');
			blob.push('');
			blob.push('');

			// XXX: Flags are used later
			socket._is_server = true;
			socket._is_client = false;

			socket.write(blob.join('\r\n'));

			if (callback !== null) {
				callback(true);
			}

			return true;

		}

	} else {

		if (callback !== null) {
			callback(false);
		}

		return false;

	}

};

	Web-Socket Frames can be a bit complicated when just looking at
	the figure. Here's a bullet-point list of what to remember
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frames can be fragmented (because of TCP), so the first bit is the <code>fin</code> flag.</li>
	<li>The <code>rsv1</code> , <code>rsv2</code> and <code>rsv3</code> are Web-Socket Extension flags. If set to <code>1</code> , the payload can be processed differently.</li>
	<li>The <code>opcode</code> decides what kind of Web-Socket frame follows.</li>
	<li>The <code>client-to-server</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> decides whether or not the payload needs to be XOR-masked.</li>
	<li>The <code>masking key</code> is <code>32 bits</code> long (4 bytes). It is only transferred when <code>mask flag</code> is set to <code>1</code> .</li>
	<li>The <code>server-to-client</code> …</li></ul></article></div>

<p>We are excited to announce the release of&nbsp;<a href="https://compliantkubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compliant Kubernetes</a>&nbsp;0.9.0. Among the most exciting features, are support for multiple workload clusters and OpenID group claims support.</p>

			<h2>Multiple Workload Clusters, Single Service Cluster</h2>		</p>

				<div data-id="3b2adad" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<p>Since release 0.9.0, a single service cluster can now monitor and audit multiple workload clusters. This allows organization to have one workload cluster per team, application or department — whatever suits their information security policies — but without incurring an increase in monitoring overhead. As shown below, Compliant Kubernetes operators can now choose in most Grafana dashboards whether the status should be displayed for all workload clusters or only a selected few.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div data-id="2b05105" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<p>To simplify compliance with access control policies, Compliant Kubernetes now includes support for propagating group claims from OpenID providers — such as Okta and Google — to Grafana, Harbor and the Kubernetes API. This allows your organization’s central roles to be mapped to various permissions. For example, when onboarding a new hire, you may add them to the “on-call operator” group in Okta, which will immediately give them access to various Grafana dashboards and <code>kubectl exec</code> permissions.</p>

          <p>Good evening<br>
My girlfriend has a problem.  In the last 2 days she received 2 request from this fake number +84, that she promptly blocked here in Signal.<br>
She has already checked and these are not sms but Signal Chat.<br>
She also blocked the numbers on her phone for sms and calls through wildcard (+84*).<br>
Is it possible to block the complete international country code +84 in Signal?<br>
Please find attached screenshots.<br>
Thank you in advance.<br>

          <p>Hi. Probably they are not Italian. The phrases are written in very good Italian but are only some words who everybody can translate good. They are not Italian for sure. I’m worried beacause my girlfriend received 2 spam chat in 2 days.</p>
<p>Personally, it never happened to me even if I use some other messages’ programs<br>
Edit:<br>
3 day 3 chat Spam<br>

        <p>Shouldn’t the victim of such spam disable the Sealed Sender option “Allow from anyone”, if it’s currently activated? Nobody has mentioned this yet. This should allow server-side restrictions to kick in, hopefully there are some in place.</p>

<p>Also found this reddit thread from an hour ago where someone had it happen on both Android and iOS: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/la4lrk/scam_messages_via_signal/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://old.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/la4lrk/scam_messages_via_signal/</a></p>
<p>[Edit: wow that reddit-thread isn’t helpful at all. “just block the number and move on”. I should just tell friends and family to ignore the spam on Signal while they’re saying they have not received a single spam message on WhatsApp in 5+ years? <img src="https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:"> ]</p>

<p>isnt this just spam SMS being received by signal because its set to default SMS app?</p>
<p>how can you get spam from a signal contact if you dont have the number in your contacts?</p>
<p>just turn off signal for SMS and block the spam SMS like everyone else in the world.</p>
<p>(fwiw, signal should turn off SMS integration. no one wants verification codes and all sorts of cruft mixed in with messages from legit contacts)</p>

          <p>It’s different because it’s also happening on iOS. You can’t set Signal to default SMS app on iPhone or iPad. Signal doesn’t integrate with SMS at all on iOS because the default SMS app on iOS is using Apple’s own messaging service called iMessage.</p>
<p>To be clear:</p>

<p>this is not happening on iPhone or iPad. You can’t get those SMS in Signal.</p>

<p>Signal servers cannot see the content of messages, so they have no idea if the same message is being spammed to people. The only thing they can do is rate-limit senders who are sending unusually high numbers of messages, but if you notice, those screenshots have completely different numbers for “Amazon”, so the spammers are using multiple accounts, meaning they can send more messages without being as obvious.</p>

        <p>Correct me if I’m wrong: WhatsApp uses also encryption for messages and I have never ever received a scam message on WA. So I assume that WA did something to prevent this. Maybe Signal is capable to installing a security policy which does the same, or is Signal built different by design completely? Don’t get me wrong, I want to use Signal as much as possible but with scammers on Signal it will be hard to convince others to use it, especially in Germany for example.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the owner of a kebab joint slap a <strong>massive, buzzing wasp </strong>with his <strong>bare hand</strong> directly into the grill whilst you pitch your new startup to him? If this also happens to you, <em>your business idea is not good</em>.</p>
<p>Many gurus online will tell you how to achieve success. I’m the opposite. Today I will instruct you on the noble art of achieving <strong>failure when creating a new software startup</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s right. Want to know a <strong>secret </strong>(it’s all about secrets today)? If you want to ensure your new startup fails, then please <strong>keep your idea secret so that nobody steals it</strong>. We learned this lesson the painful way.</p>
<p>But wait, who am I? I’m a guy that started creating software companies back in 2014 and failed a few times until I eventually succeeded. You can check my <a href="https://diego-os.com/about-me/" data-type="page" data-id="11">About Page</a> to learn more about me.</p>
<p>This post is part of a series where I share <strong>common pitfalls on starting a company</strong> – <em>and how to avoid them</em>. I’ve fallen for these traps before so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Also, I promise <strong>the wasp story is real</strong> and related to the topic. You will soon see…</p>
<h2>Coding in “stealth mode”</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story. The year was 2015, and I had a great cushy job right after graduation. I no longer had to eat <em>unbranded pasta</em> and <em>questionable ham sandwiches</em> every day, I was living the dream!</p>
<p>But then, I caught the sneaky <strong>startup bug</strong>. I thought, why work for someone else when I can <strong>follow my dreams</strong> and <strong>start a startup?</strong></p>
<p>I somehow happened to read somewhere that JustEat – the takeaway delivery company – was making <strong>a lot of money</strong>. Why not start something like that, but somehow “better”?</p>
<p>So, I read a couple of business books, I partnered up with someone, and we started coding in our spare time. In no time we had a prototype for our killer app… a JustEat clone… <em><strong>but with pictures of the food!</strong></em> Revolutionary!</p>
<p>Curious to learn what happened next? Did this epic tale of the underdogs following their dreams end up in massive success? Will the bards of the future sing about our heroic deeds? is wasp kebab any good?</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: Our fear of Bill Gates dropping from a helicopter into our “office” (a smelly bedroom) to snatch our “archives” (a battered notebook I bought in Poland for £0.20) didn’t materialize. Something else happened.</p>
<h2>But “I don’t want anyone to steal my ideas”</h2>
<p>So, we came up with a random idea for a food-related app, and called it <strong>Foodswiper </strong>– it was like Tinder, <em>but for food</em>. Then, we started coding for months <strong>in secret</strong>, without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, our idea was so valuable, so <em>irresistible</em>, that mentioning it would trigger all our friends to immediately ditch their jobs and families, and start coding to <strong>steal our idea</strong>. Even our moms were suspected of such intrigues.</p>
<p>I remember my flatmate throwing away post from the government directed at our company. He thought the address was wrong – I rescued the letter from the rubbish at night (of course in secret) and felt like <strong>James Bond</strong>.</p>
<p>So, why is all of this wrong?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, <strong>nobody is going to steal your ideas</strong>. The only ideas worth protecting are highly specialized academic research, military secrets, copyrightable material, etc. The obvious stuff that needs to be secret.</p>
<p>Secondly, keeping your idea secret prevents you from getting <strong>crucial feedback</strong> <strong>from customers</strong>, and getting customer feedback should be your goal when starting a new software product company.</p>
<p>In our case, with Foodswiper, we spent months coding the application up and when we finally came out to the real world to get some customers… we discovered that <strong>nobody wanted our app</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of pain and resources could have been saved if we tried to get our idea out there earlier instead of coding it up in secret for months.</p>
<h2>Why do people fall for this trap?</h2>
<p>I literally think the real reason people keep their ideas secret is <strong>fear of failure</strong>. Ironically, this fear of failure leads to failure itself!</p>
<p>People that want to start startups are often – but not always – accomplished individuals that have succeeded at many things in the past. <strong>When you have a good track record, you don’t want to sully it with failure.</strong></p>
<p>For example, in my case, I kind of had a very good trajectory. I graduated top of my class from Cambridge University, got a great job at Citi, and was succeeding at everything I cared about in life.</p>
<p>If you asked me back then why I kept my startup idea secret, I probably would have said <em>“so that nobody steals it”</em>, but the real reason was probably closer to fear of failure coupled with inexperience.</p>
<p>A startup is a big gamble. So many things can go wrong. It can be really painful to be “winning at life” for many years and then lose it all. <strong>All your fancy titles mean nothing</strong> when you start a startup. It’s all about results.</p>
<p>Some people invest all their money and get financially ruined after all, and plenty of really accomplished people have tried the startup game and failed. We all know some stories like these of have heard of them.</p>
<h2>The solution: limiting the downside</h2>
<p>At least I can proudly say we had <strong>some </strong>foresight back in the day. We acknowledged that we didn’t know many things so we engineered a situation where it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we failed.</p>
<p>Basically, we saved up all we could working in London. Then, we moved to a cheap country where our savings would last us around 2 years. This gave us <strong>plenty of time to learn</strong> (and eventually succeed with a different idea).</p>
<p>The backup plan was to come back to working as software developers for another company, and we were young and had no dependents, so the risk of total failure was mostly mitigated.</p>
<p>When you remove the risk of catastrophic ruin should your idea not work out, then you limit the fear and increase your chances of success.</p>
<h2>Gather customer feedback early</h2>
<p>I promised I would talk about the wasp. So picking up where I left off, we coded furiously for months, and then, we took to the streets of London to try to convince restaurant owners one by one to sign up for our app.</p>
<p>Did I mention this was <strong>after</strong> I quit my job to pursue that startup idea full time? i.e. <strong>dropping my income to zero</strong>. This was a depressing time. Nobody from any restaurant was interested at all.</p>
<p>Imagine a twenty-something year old, <em>inexplicably dressed in a suit,</em> entering your takeaway establishment and asking if you want to sign up for an app with <strong>no users</strong> that they have <strong>never heard of</strong>.</p>
<p>We basically visited hundreds of restaurants and nobody, <strong>zero people</strong>, were interested… until we got a signal from the heavens.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive search we finally found <em>one guy</em> that wanted to sign up for our app. To be fair, this man was really enthusiastic and wanted to help, I really appreciate people like this, but it was not meant to be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this just wouldn’t work. This is when the guy slapped the wasp into the grill. Needless to say you don’t want to see a dead wasp in your food. Also, too bad we needed millions of other people to also sign up.</p>
<p>There were so many insurmountable problems. If only the guy slapped me in the face that day, maybe that way I would have learned quicker.</p>
<p>We should have stopped the project then with the wasp incident, but we still stubbornly continued for 6 more months. For some reason we thought that restaurants were not interested because <strong>we lacked features!</strong> </p>
<p>It makes me cringe to think about those extra 6 months now. What we were lacking was <strong>customers</strong>, not <strong>features</strong>. We had <em>freaking </em>business cards! But not a single user.</p>
<p>We somehow convinced ourselves to continue writing code and features with no users! It’s insanity! We even <strong>made up</strong> some graphs with “projections” and automated billing systems for zero cash-flow. Ridiculous.</p>
<h2>Succeed with your idea instead of keeping it secret</h2>
<p>Instead of keeping your idea secret you should test it as soon as possible. Don’t fall for the same trap we did.</p>
<p>In our case, we eventually learned this lesson and stopped <em>Foodswiper</em>. We then tested 5 business ideas in just one month <strong>before</strong> coding them up. Out of those 5, one of them was <a href="https://nutriadmin.com/">https://nutriadmin.com</a>, which was successful.</p>
<p>We tested the ideas <strong>very quickly</strong> by creating a single one page mockup for each, and then placing ads, sending cold emails, and contacting prospects to ask if they would buy the product we were planning to build.</p>
<p>This allowed us to quickly discard 4 out of our 5 ideas (we didn’t find any interest for them for different reasons).</p>
<p>Moreover, when we found the app idea for nutritionists, the people we talked to gave us <strong>a list of the features they would need</strong>, and other key details that helped us succeed! Clearly this is a much better approach!</p>
<p>When we eventually launched our first (terrible) version of the software, we already had a couple of people in our list to try to sell it to. Even though we lacked features, some people paid for it and said they found it <strong>useful</strong>!</p>
<p>Over the years we have extended and grown this app to a much more professional product. But it all started with an idea and customer feedback. <strong>Crucially</strong>, it didn’t start with months of coding in secret.</p>
<p>I didn’t invent this “technique”, it’s broadly called <strong>customer development</strong>, and was popularized by Steve Blank in his book <em>The 4 steps to the epiphany</em> and later by his student Eric Ries in <em>The Lean Startup</em>. It works, confirmed.</p>

While answering these questions, we will discuss some of the core concepts that are vital for newcomers and engineers looking to keep pace with emerging cloud computing technologies.</p><p>This blog post is the first in our Serverless Series about serverless computing. If you want to learn more about how serverless technologies is changing the application landscape, be sure to check out the next blog post in the Serverless Series: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://koyeb.com/blog/going-serverless-implications-benefits-and-challenges"><strong>Going Serverless: Implications, Benefits and Challenges</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#overview"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>In short, serverless computing means the fact of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely abstracted for the user.</p><p>Serverless is a significant evolution in cloud computing because users no longer have to manage the underlying infrastructure in order to scale their functions, containers, databases, and more; cloud service providers take care of this for them automatically and cost-effectively.</p><p>Above all, going serverless is a strategic decision with considerable benefits in the short and long term. Serverless is becoming the new standard to host modern and greenfield applications.</p><h2 id="quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing">Quick Refresher on the History of Cloud Computing<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="pre-cc-cloud-computing">Pre-CC (Cloud Computing)<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#pre-cc-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>At the dawn of the computing era, those who wanted to leverage computing technology needed to buy, install, maintain, and upgrade their own physical servers - a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor.</p><p>Even with their high-cost, computing technologies increased efficiency by orders of magnitude, so firms began to transition to the digital era. Still, building a computing infrastructure required massive amounts of upfront investment in the form of time, manpower, and money. Best practices included investing in large computing infrastructures that your firm would grow into and owning enough servers to handle the occasional spikes in activity. This capacity over-provisioning was really inefficient with expensive servers idling most of the time.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-emergence">Cloud Computing Emergence<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#cloud-computing-emergence"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Since the introduction of cloud computing in the mid-2000s, individuals and firms alike can outsource their computing infrastructures to cloud service providers (CSPs). CSPs provide and manage different levels of cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/aaS-graphic.png" alt="Managed Services"></p><p>IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are often represented as a pyramid as each of them provides a higher level of abstraction.</p><p>This outsourcing is a radical evolution in computing practices. Small and large companies alike can save incredible amounts of money, manpower, and time all while tailoring their computing infrastructures exactly to their needs and refocusing those resources back into their businesses.</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-serverless">The Rise of Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-rise-of-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term">Serverless is a Broad and Global Term<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless computing is an evolution of cloud computing. In short, serverless computing means the duty of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely removed for the user. </p><p>In fact, the word serverless only makes sense from the user's perspective because the user no longer has to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Servers are still very much in the picture as servers perform the computing operations, but there is a responsibility shift: they are now maintained and provisioned by the cloud service provider.</p><p>The term serverless started to be actively used in the industry for mainstream computing and web applications in 2015, after the launch of AWS Lambda, a serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform. Although FaaS is often associated with the serverless term, these two concepts should not be conflated. During the following years, a lot of other serverless services emerged, and the promise to reduce infrastructure complexity quickly enticed developers and companies.</p><h3 id="everything-serverless">Everything Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#everything-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Nearly all services can become serverless: compute, storage, database, messaging, and more. Indeed, there are already several different types of managed serverless services: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), and Database-as-a-service (DBaaS), just to name a few.</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/types-of-serverless-services.png" alt="Managed Serverless Services"></p><p>At its core, going serverless means outsourcing the work of managing your underlying infrastructure. It means no longer having to scale, operate, or update the servers that run your applications. Cloud service providers now handle these operations and offer them as a service.</p><h3 id="the-technologies-enabling-serverless">The Technologies enabling Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-technologies-enabling-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless technologies are possible thanks to a combination of several computer science advancements:</p><ul><li><strong>Containers:</strong> The rise of containerized resources with improvements in core Linux cgroups feature, hardware virtualization and the Docker/OCI are core enablers, allowing efficient virtualization and abstraction of physical resources.</li><li><strong>Ability to host arbitrary code:</strong> The ability to securely host any code with isolation thanks to virtualization progress is essential to allow mainstream serverless.</li><li><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong> The increase in network bandwidth and reduction of network latency has enabled wider distributed computing adoption, which is essential to provide variable amounts of computing power, above the limits of a single physical server.</li><li><strong>Versioning, naming and discovery:</strong> The last decade has seen significant progress in continuous deployment technologies with improvements in versioning and service discovery tooling, increasing the capacity to deploy in a distributed environment.</li><li><strong>Events and message passing:</strong> Event-driven architectures are a significant enabler for serverless as tasks can easily be distributed and processing power can grow as requests come.</li><li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Creating small, specialized services is essential to provide the right amount of resources for each processing function.</li><li><strong>Autoscaling:</strong> Finally, autoscaling is a core component of serverless, which has itself been made possible by strong advancements in load-balancing and monitoring technologies.</li></ul><p>The AtLarge Research Team provides a good overview of the technological evolution that lead to serverless in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/serverless-history-now-future18ieeeic.pdf"><em>Serverless is More: From PaaS to Present Computing</em></a>, give it a read if you want to dive deeper!</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#further-reading"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>We hope you enjoyed this short retrospective on the history of cloud computing and serverless.

February 5, 2021 | https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>We’ve been on a bit of a device enablement kick lately: from <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a> and <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> to <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/devices-slimbook">Slimbook</a>, <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/now-shipping-elementary-os#laptop-with-linux">Laptop With Linux</a>, and <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/now-shipping-elementary-os#star-labs">Star Labs</a>, we’ve been working with specific devices and device makers more than ever. We covered these efforts—and why they’re so important—in <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/our-2020-in-review#hardware">our 2020 in review</a>.</p>

<p>There’s another angle, though, that we’re starting to see come into play: when elementary is more directly involved, the improvements made for these specific devices benefit <em>everyone</em>—not just one specific device or OEM. Here are some areas in elementary OS that are seeing improvements directly due to recent hardware enablement efforts:</p>

<h2 id="boot-experience">Boot Experience</h2>

<p>We’ve been working on the first-run experience of elementary OS for a few years now, including a <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/say-hello-to-the-new-greeter">new login and lock screen greeter</a>, a <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/get-settled-into-elementary-os-with-onboarding">new “welcome” onboarding experience</a>, and the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/meet-the-upcoming-installer">new Installer</a> coming with elementary OS 6. An area we’ve also been working on for elementary OS 6 is the boot screen itself: what you see while your device is turning on, but before the operating system is fully booted.</p>

<p>Our approach to the new boot screen was informed heavily by our work with Star Labs; they ship elementary OS on their laptops, and several system components are updatable via the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://fwupd.org/">Linux Vendor Firmware Service using fwupd</a>. When installing a system firmware update via fwupd, part of the process requires a reboot so the update can happen “offline” (e.g. when the operating system itself is not fully running). This offline update can show feedback and progress on the boot screen, if the boot screen supports it. In elementary OS 5.1, that just gives you a slowly pulsing elementary “e” logomark, so Star Labs installs their own OEM boot screen—which works, and is the kind of work OEMs often do for better integration.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/boot-loading.jpg" alt="Boot Screen: loading spinner"></p>
  <figcaption>The elementary OS 6 boot screen on a Star LabTop Mk IV</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve been working on something even better out of the box: a minimalist, seamless boot screen that also supports modern features like firmware updates and encrypted disk unlocking. This boot screen builds on the work of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/">FreeDesktop.org Plymouth project</a>, delivering flicker-free boot on many systems. Our design approach was to let the OEM branding—if provided—shine while offering minimal supplemental information. If an OEM sets a boot logo in their system firmware, our boot screen will load that and display it. While the operating system is loading, we add a small, minimal spinner in the same style as loading spinners in elementary OS. If an encrypted disk needs to be unlocked, there’s a minimalist password entry provided. And finally, when installing firmware updates, we provide straightforward messaging using the same typography as in elementary OS 6.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/boot-password.jpg" alt="Boot Screen: unlocking an encrypted drive">

  <figcaption>
    <p><strong>Left:</strong> Unlocking an encrypted drive | <strong>Right:</strong> Installing a firmware update</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The end result is that elementary OS 6 is an even more seamless experience from powering on your device through logging in, while also supporting features OEMs care about. For a fallback—e.g. on platforms that don’t support boot logos, like Raspberry Pi or Pinebook Pro—we show the elementary “e” logomark, similar to today. This fallback feature was <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth/-/merge_requests/125">contributed to Plymouth upstream</a>. This boot screen work was tackled largely by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a>, so be sure to consider <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">sponsoring him on GitHub Sponsors</a> for all his contributions.</p>

<h2 id="installer--initial-setup">Installer &amp; Initial Setup</h2>

<p>The new installer for elementary OS 6 has been <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/meet-the-upcoming-installer">in the works</a> for quite some time. From the beginning, it was designed to handle very little: getting the OS onto your device. While designing and developing the installer, we realized how we could also cater to OEMs without needing an entirely separate OEM installation flow: <em>every</em> install is treated like an OEM install.</p>


<p>We’ve worked with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> to create this new installer, designing the front-end while building on their distinst back-end. Their perspective as an OEM helped inform some design decisions, as has working with our OEM retailers. The new installer essentially handles the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a language and keyboard layout to use in the installer</li>
  <li>Choose to try a live “Demo Mode” or to install the OS</li>
  <li>Select a drive to install to</li>
  <li>Reboot to continue, or shut down to set up later</li>
</ol>

<p>This last step is the key to the OEM-friendly approach; since the installer explicitly does not handle creating or setting up a user account, the next step is identical whether you’re installing the OS for yourself, you’re installing the OS for a friend or family member, or an OEM has pre-installed the OS on a device: the end-user boots the device and is handed off to Initial Setup to create their account.</p>

  <figcaption>Initial Setup creates the first user account, regardless of how the OS was installed</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Initial Setup flow means a system administrator or lower-volume OEM can manually step through the couple of steps to install the OS each time, and be confident that the user will unbox the device and be able to set it up as expected. It also means larger OEMs can create an installation image from this installed state and image it directly to their devices’ storage without manual steps. It even means that builds for specific hardware—like the ARM-based Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi—have you flash an “installed” image onto the storage medium, and you get the exact same Initial Setup experience as any other installation. Regardless of how you get elementary OS, the Installation and Initial Setup process is always a tested, first-class experience.</p>

<h2 id="firmware-updates--system-information">Firmware Updates &amp; System Information</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the Boot Experience section, updatable firmware—specifically using LVFS and fwupd—is an emerging feature among our OEM retailers. In addition to the boot screen work here, we’ve been hard at work adding this capability right into System Settings. Much of this front-end work was again handled by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a>, building on the excellent work of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/">Richard Hughes</a> and fwupd.</p>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While we were working on enabling firmware updates, we redesigned the <em>System Settings</em> → <em>System</em> area—formerly <em>System Settings</em> → <em>About</em>—with a new tabbed layout and refreshed typography. The Operating System tab shows off a dynamic OS logo using the user’s accent color and the default release wallpaper, with a better layout for OS links and actions. The Hardware tab pulls information from the system hardware as well as <code>/etc/oem.conf</code>, enabling OEMs to provide a high-resolution logo or product image, model-specific branding, and a link for their own website. We also improved the detection and display of certain hardware, especially GPUs and ARM processors.</p>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All of these improvements will be shipping to users of elementary OS 6. Firmware updates require the firmware be uploaded to the LVFS, but we’re seeing manufacturers large and small—from Star Labs and 8bitdo to Logitech, Dell, and Lenovo—adopt it, so there’s a good chance at least some of your hardware will be updatable in this way.</p>

<h2 id="num-lock--caps-lock-indicators">Num Lock &amp; Caps Lock Indicators</h2>

<p>Some keyboards and devices don’t have built-in Num Lock or Caps Lock indicators—whether it’s a minimalist mechanical keyboard or a laptop. Star Labs laptops have this quirk, and so on GNOME-based OSes, they install an extension to add these indicators to the top panel. In parallel, we have received user requests to support such indicators in elementary OS for people who have this sort of hardware.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/indicators.png" alt="Keyboard indicator settings" width="856" height="556"></p>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve now added this capability to the top panel in elementary OS 5.1 and newer, bringing it to OEMs like Star Labs as well as any end user who wants it; just head to <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Keyboard</em> → <em>Layout</em> and turn on the “Show in Panel” switch for whichever indicator you’d like.</p>

<h2 id="multi-touch-gestures">Multi-touch Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve written more extensively about <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6">our work with multi-touch gestures in elementary OS 6</a>, but it is important to give some of the credit to our work with OEMs; some retailers like Slimbook currently include third-party software for trackpad gestures in their images of elementary OS 5.1, but it’s not as integrated as it could be. Our goal is for it to be built into the operating system and not require configuring anything out of the box—while also offering sensible preferences where users expect in <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Mouse &amp; Touchpad</em> → <em>Gestures</em>.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/gestures.png" alt="Gestures settings" width="856" height="556"></p>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Enable and configure multi-touch gestures in <em>System Settings</em></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now all multi-touch-capable trackpads and touchscreens will benefit from this gesture work, instead of it being different depending on the OEM or requiring extra third-party tools.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Lastly, a significant amount of performance work has been going into elementary OS 6 thanks to our work on Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi builds; this class of hardware is lower-powered than our typical target hardware, so every little bit helps. We’ve largely been reducing and asynchronizing inter-process communication between desktop components, removing unused code, and reducing disk I/O—especially important on lower-clocked processors and slower storage mediums like SD cards.</p>

<p>And of course, any performance improvements on the lower end also benefit higher-end devices as well. Most of this work has been handled by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>; you can <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/davidmhewitt">sponsor him on GitHub Sponsors</a> to encourage him to keep it up!</p>

And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How much time went into preparing the iPhone demo?</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.&nbsp;</p><p>I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!&nbsp;</p><p>With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections. </p><p>So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic.&nbsp;The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Amazing!

I want you to fucking go home right now and tell me why I shouldn’t fire you tomorrow.” So I went home that night and I probably worked on 15 or 16 versions of an email trying to explain everything. But then I just decided to say “Steve, you know how I feel, but you’re the boss. You let me know tomorrow whether I’m fired or not.” I never heard another word about it.</p><p>The mythology of him mostly comes from individuals that didn't survive around him. The people who got close knew the rules, knew how to work with him, knew his core desires and what he was trying to achieve. They never really had problems with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Someone told me early on that if you do something great, you just have to acknowledge it yourself because you’re not going to get it from him except on a rare occasion. A lot of people who weren’t used to that would come in to present their product plan or whatever, and they would be seeking to make themselves look good and get praise from Steve. If he got a whiff of that, he would rip you down a peg.&nbsp;</p><p>He was usually right because the person usually didn’t do a great job. Those are the ones who flamed out and then had the horrible things to say because they couldn’t admit to themselves that they couldn’t cut the mustard.</p><p>He was a complex individual but he always desired the best out of everybody. He was ultimately very caring. He had his own relationship with my daughter from the age of 4 years old and let her come to rehearsals and events. He even asked her opinion a few times when the team couldn’t decide between particular graphics to use.</p></div><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Give us an example of when he went off on you because he expected better.</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><div><p>When we launched the Lifesaver iMacs (the color ones), Steph Adams [Owner of Adams &amp; Asscociates—the outside production company for Apple] and I were trying to bring them out from behind the screen and raise them up out of their pedestals. A week before the event and we were still struggling to synchronize them and make the motion smooth. This was before computer-controlled movement machinery was readily available.</p><p>After mentioning this to Steve, he literally says, “I know the guys from Cirque du Soleil, why don’t you call them?” With one week left, we couldn’t do that so we stuck with our way. It was a hand-crank thing. When you looked at it close, it was really bad. But when you were in the audience, you couldn’t tell unless you knew what to look for. However, Steve was on the stage watching these things not perfectly aligned with a little bit of stuttering. He wasn’t happy and we could see it in the video feed we were watching.</p><p>The show went off, no one ever noticed or mentioned it in the press, but yet he noticed. He pulled me and Steph aside. There were people all around so he didn’t scream or yell at us. It was one of those “I’m really disappointed. At any other time I’d probably fire you.” For ten minutes he went on and on.

        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">

              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10
11
2
3
...
9

// Numerical sort
1
2
3
...
9
10
11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.
01
02
03
...
09
10
11
12</code></pre>
        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10
...
2019-12-28
...
2020-08-26
...</code></pre>
        
        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>

              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>

        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct.

<p>This is the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, II) discussion of the idea of a ‘universal warrior’ – the assumption that there is a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of fundamental truth for understanding war, either in the past or present, or else a useful blueprint for current life more generally.  In investigating this question, we are using Steven Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">recent video series</a> as our foil, since it is a more completely explained expression of this idea and one should always try to debate the stronger form of the opposing argument.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">Last time we took a look at the social place of people involved in war</a>.  We found that, far from there being a universal combatant, distinctions between soldiers and warriors are both significant for the present and important for understanding the past.  Moreover, beyond that simple dichotomy, the idea of a universal war experience in turn conceals the basic fact that many people who were neither warriors nor soldiers, not properly combatants of any kind, experienced war in unique ways, be they victims of warfare, homefront supporters, or economically invested in the enterprise.  Already we have seen that there’s far more than just one sort of person <em>with</em> a war experience.</p>



<p>This week (and next), we’re narrowing our focus just to the combatants and asking to what degree is even the experience of combat and soldiering (or ‘warrioring’) common.  Does it evoke the same emotions or require the same kinds of character?  Is it conditioned on the same values?  Does it involve the same activities or experiences?  Is combat understood the same, from one society to another?</p>



<p>Even so narrowed, our topic is necessarily massive, since we are considering the experience of <em>all</em> wars at <em>all</em> times.  But fortunately (for the wear and tear on my keyboard, if nothing else) our thesis – that there are quite a lot of broad universals in the war experience – does not need to be tested <em>everywhere</em> if it can be shown to fail in many places.  Consequently, we are going to bounce around a bit here; I hope the reader will understand that I mean these examples to be broadly representative, rather than exhaustive.</p>



<p>If that method seems a bit patchwork, it is important to remember just how <em>expansive</em> the argument implied by this notion of a ‘universal’ warrior or war experience is.  <strong>In arguing for a ‘warrior archetype’ that recurs in all cultures</strong> (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-eight/">as Steven Pressfield does</a>),<strong> or more obliquely in arguing that some given sort of long vanished ‘warrior culture’ </strong>(like the Spartans) <strong>provides material for emulation today, they are making a claim for a <em>human universal</em>, and a profound one at that</strong>.  After all, the suggestion is not that, for instance, some particular Spartan (or knightly, or Viking, or Samurai, or Apache, or…) tactic or weapon should today be used, but that the <em>ethos</em> and worldview of those ‘warriors’ is valuable because it taps into a true human <em>constant</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Because after all, a lot has changed!</strong>  We no longer fight with spears, or muskets.  Our wars are, in some obvious ways, vastly different from the conflicts of the past.  <strong>Yet for these past values, social systems, or habits to be directly applicable to the present, <em>something</em> would have to be fundamentally constant, at a deep and fairly profound level, in human conflict</strong>.  And it has to be something rather more than ‘people die in war, and that is sad for some people.’  After all, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html">people die in logging</a>, and you don’t hear all of these fellows waxing lyrical about the ‘universal lumberjack’ (though I can assure you, if it does exist well…<a href="https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM">then he’s a lumberjack and he’s ok</a>).  It has to be something more than ‘war is scary’ because after all so too is running <em>into </em>burning buildings, but we’re not discussing patterning our lives around the ‘universal firefighter’ either.  There would have to be some more profound truth to the phrase – to abuse the <em>Fallout</em> series – that ‘War, war never changes.’</p>



<p>And that is a thesis we can test!  Does war change from one culture to the next?  From one period to the next?  From one place to the next?  Let’s find out!</p>

<h2>Raids and Battles</h2>



<p>So what is the experience of combat like?  Well, first we have to ask, <em>what sort of combat do you mean?</em></p>



<p>As I’ve noted before, the branch of military history most focused on the experience of combat is what is sometimes called the ‘Face of Battle’ school, after John Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle</em> (1976).  Taking three battles from English history (Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme), Keegan aimed to reconstruct the experience of those battles in its own long chapter, beginning with the campaign that led to them, then discussing the interaction of men and weapons (infantry vs. cavalry, cavalry vs. cavalry and so on) seeking to use the physics of the battlefield to explain how these interactions would go.  He then focuses on how men cohered in the face of terror; then on to the casualties and the aftermath.</p>



<p>We might imagine that this standard order (replicated, I might add, in <em>The Western Way of War </em>(1989), albeit with more problems of evidence) implies a standard sequence of events, moments and emotions in a battle.</p>



<p>Except that for most of the human experience, this sort of battle was rare and generally indecisive when it did happen (a point which leads to the marvelous title of the upcoming, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Face-Battle-Forgotten-Experience/dp/0190920645">The Other Face of Battle</a></em>).  This ‘Face of Battle’ kind of war – formally constituted field armies meeting in set-piece battles out on open fields, with a clearly defined ‘peace’ before and after the war, along with a zone of conflict and a ‘home front’ – is the kind of war modern folks tend to be quickest to imagine, because in most of the industrialized world, we imagine this as <em>our</em> way of war.  But it not the oldest, or most common, or original way of war.</p>



<p>The oldest way of war was what Native North Americans called – evocatively – the ‘cutting off’ way of war (a phrase I am borrowing from W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America” in <em>Empires and Indigines</em>, ed. W. Lee (2011)), but which was common among non-state peoples <em>everywhere</em> in the world for the vast stretch of human history (and one may easily argue much of modern insurgency and terrorism is merely this same toolkit, updated with modern weapons).  <a href="https://youtu.be/4I8kic8xZh8">The goal of such warfare was not to subjugate a population but to drive them off, forcing them to vacate resource-rich land which could then be exploited by your group</a>.  To do this, you wanted to inflict maximum damage (casualties inflicted, animals rustled, goods stolen, people captured) at minimum risk, until the lopsided balance of pain you inflicted forced the enemy to simply move away from you to get out of your operational range.</p>



<p>The main tool of this form of warfare (detailed more extensively in A. Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) and L. Keeley, <em>War Before Civilization</em> (1996)) was the raid.  Rather than announcing your movements, a war party would attempt to advance into enemy territory in secret, hoping (in the best case) to catch an enemy village or camp unawares (typically by night) so that the population could be killed or captured (<em>mostly</em> killed; these are mostly non-specialized societies with limited ability to incorporate large numbers of subjugated captives) safely.  Then you <em>quickly</em> get out of enemy territory before villages or camps allied to your target can retaliate.  If you detected an incoming raid, you might rally up <em>your</em> allied villages or camps and ambush the ambusher in an equally lopsided engagement.</p>



<p>Only rarely in this did a <em>battle</em> result – typically when both the surprise of the raid and the surprise of the counter-raid ambush failed.  At that point, with the chance for surprise utterly lost, both sides might line up and exchange missile fire (arrows, javelins) at fairly long range.  Casualties in these battles were generally very low – instead the battle served both as a display of valor and a signal of resolve by both sides to continue the conflict.  That isn’t to say these wars were bloodless – indeed the overall level of military mortality was much <em>higher</em> than in ‘pitched battle’ cultures, but the killing was done almost entirely in the ambush and the raid.</p>



<p><strong>We may call this the first system of war.</strong>  It is the oldest, but as noted above, never entirely goes away.  We tend to call this style ‘asymmetric’ or ‘unconventional’ war, but it is the <em>most</em> conventional war – it was the first convention, after all.  It is also sometimes denigrated as primitive, but should not be judged so quickly – first system armies have managed to frustrate far stronger opponents when terrain and politics were favorable.</p>

<p>What changed?  Very briefly, agriculture, cities and the state.  Agriculture created a stationary population that both wouldn’t move but which could also be dominated, subjugated and have their production extracted from them.  Their wealth was clustered in towns which could be fortified with walls that would resist any quick raid, but control of that fortified town center (and its administrative apparatus of taxation) meant control of the countryside and its resources.  Taking such a town meant a siege – delivering a large body of troops and keeping them there long enough to either breach the walls or starve out the town into surrender.  This created a war where …</p></div></div>

        <p>For those of you who don’t recognize him, the photo above is me and Richard Donnell Ross, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross" target="_blank">“Freeway Rick” Ross</a>: the most infamous crack dealer of all time (not the fat ass rapper who stole his name). The original “Johnny Appleseed of Crack”. The most successful crack dealer in history. I figured that the photo was appropriate.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, <a href="https://edlatimore.com/the-projects/">I grew up in the projects.</a></p>

<p>In the ghetto, there are crackheads. In case you didn’t know, crackheads are people addicted to crack-cocaine. Crackheads and the ghetto go together like Kool-Aid and fried chicken.</p>

<p>Crackheads get their crack from somewhere. That’s where crack dealers come in. I grew up in the projects. This means I spent a lot of time around crack dealers and crack addicts. However, my experience had a unique feature.</p>

<p>I spent about 5 years living next to a certified crackhead. When I moved to another housing project, I lived next to a crack dealer for 4 years.</p>

<p>The hood is a terrible place to begin with. I can assure you that living next to hard drug users and dealers is a unique level of hell.</p>

<p>These are my observations, lessons learned, and experiences from living next to crack dealers and crackheads.</p>



<h2 id="crackheads-are-surprisingly-functional">Crackheads are surprisingly functional</h2>

<p>A lot of crackheads rob and steal to get drug money. There are also quite a bit who have jobs.</p>

<p>They use that money to fund their crack habit and to also keep a roof over their head. Not all crackheads want to get high in a crack house.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://edlatimore.com/images/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(44).jpg" alt="Crackheads live in a crackhouse like this" title="Crackheads live in a crackhouse like this"></p>
  <figcaption>A typical crackhouse. Yes, they actually ‘live’ here.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My mom even occasionally let a crackhead babysit us. She lived next door to me as a kid. This brings me to my next experience.</p>

<h2 id="crackheads-value-drugs-over-money">Crackheads value drugs over money</h2>

<p>The crackhead next door babysat me.</p>

<p>When I was 4 years old, I picked up a syringe full of heroin and squirted it. I thought it was a water gun. The crackhead was super angry. I remember my mom offering to pay for the lost drugs, but the junkie didn’t calm down.</p>

<p>I actually don’t remember the eventual resolution.</p>

<p>In the world of a crackhead, crack is God.</p>

<p>Crackheads sell their children to get crack money. Male and female crackheads will suck dick so they can get crack when low on funds.</p>

<p>No crime is too great or too low once a person has sold their soul to the crack devil.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Read: “<a href="https://edlatimore.com/how-to-hustle-like-a-crackhead/">How To Hustle Like A Crackhead</a>”)</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="because-of-the-last-point-the-crackhead-economy-is-legendary">Because of the last point, the crackhead economy is legendary</h2>

<p>It’s common to hear someone in the hood talk about “crack prices” when referring to something inappropriately priced.</p>

<p>An object is in the “crack price” range when it’s priced low to expedite the sale.</p>

<p>My introduction to the concept of crack prices came at age 5.</p>

<p>One day my dad parked his car outside and went through the extra effort of putting his Club anti-theft device on. I asked him why he put The Club on. His response was, “So some crackhead doesn’t steal my car and sell it for 5 dollars.”</p>

<p>That confused me.</p>

<p>While 5-year old me didn’t know how much cars cost, I knew they were a lot more than 5 dollars. Once I learned that the rock is the most important thing to a crackhead, it all made sense.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve watched or been victim to this type of crackhead behavior on a few occasions.</p>

<p>I’ve known crackheads to break out car windows for loose change in the seats, ignoring anything else of value.</p>

<p>Once a crackhead broke into my apartment and only stole a jar of change and a cable box. The crackhead is extremely short-sighted.</p>

<p>It’s only thinking about the fastest way to get just enough money to get high again.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Read: “<a href="https://edlatimore.com/a-basic-bro-beginners-guide-to-making-money-online/">The Basic Bro Beginner’s Guide To Making Money Online</a>”)</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="superhuman-feats-ascribed-to-crackheads-are-inspired-by-true-events">Superhuman feats ascribed to crackheads are inspired by true events</h2>

<p>Crack doesn’t ACTUALLY give a person superpowers.</p>

<p>I joke about the crackhead superpowers, but all good jokes contain truth. What probably happens is crack changes their brain, allowing them to <a href="https://edlatimore.com/pushing-through-the-pain/">endure high amounts of pain.</a></p>

<p>I’ve seen crackheads get hit by cars and keep moving. I once watched a crackhead fall a few stories and shake it off like nothing happened. I’ve personally seen crackheads jump out of burning buildings and land in stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/moss-gorilla1.cloudvent.net/hash-store/59126b7ec26fe8b65b9b1223473bd949.jpg" alt="Crackhead strength is legendary" title="Crackhead strength is legendary" data-cms-original-src="/images/crackheadstrength.jpg"></p>
  <figcaption>Crackhead strength display</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You also don’t really meet any fat crackheads. Maybe crack raises your metabolism, but it is likely just a symptom of the previous observation. Crack is more important to crackheads than food.</p>

<p>If you only have 5 dollars from the car you stole and sold, crack comes before food. Even if you haven’t eaten in days.</p>

<h2 id="the-biggest-problem-with-illegal-drugs-is-the-violence-between-suppliers-not-between-buyers">The biggest problem with illegal drugs is the violence between suppliers, not between buyers</h2>

<p>They make a big deal about drug violence and why we need all these laws against drugs. My perspective is unique.</p>

<p>I have no skin in the game either way but grew up at ground zero of war on drugs. Here’s what I’ve observed.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually seen two crackheads fighting one another.</p>

<p>I’ve seen them fighting other non-crackheads, but they don’t really go to war with one another. However, the crack dealer next door is one of the reasons there were bullet holes in my door.</p>

<p>On a more general note, most hood violence is drug-related.</p>

<p>It’s about controlling who sells what, where, and for how much. Random muggings aren’t as common as shooting disputes over street corners.</p>

<h2 id="bad-traits-come-in-clusters-especially-with-crack-dealers">Bad traits come in clusters. Especially with crack dealers</h2>

<p>I’ve met a few dealers of all different substances. My general experience has been that the harder the drug, the worse the human being is that deals it.</p>

<p>I’m sure this is a result of the level of ruthlessness you need to get into and survive the game. Harder drugs are worth more money so the competition is tougher.</p>

<p>This is merely speculation, but it makes sense.</p>

<p>The crack dealer who lived next door to me regularly beat his girlfriend. Once, he tried to push his way into my house to go after my then 10-year-old sister to beat her.</p>

<p>She played a harmless prank, but he didn’t care. I pushed him out of my house, but for weeks I worried that he’d shoot my 13-year-old ass.</p>

<h2 id="dont-start-no-shit-there-wont-be-no-shit-with-crack-dealers">Don’t start no shit there won’t be no shit with crack dealers</h2>

<p>Drug dealing is a thing a person gets into to make money.</p>

<p>The ROI is shitty, but most guys sell drugs as a way to make ends meet. They aren’t in it to fuck the world up or hurt others (despite what drugs do to people).</p>

<p>They just want to put food on the table.</p>

<p>You generally don’t have to worry about drug dealers trying to hurt or you rob you for no good reason.</p>

<p>Unless you’re a player in the game, you’re safe. These guys have other issues but if you keep to yourself, you don’t have to worry about crack dealers.</p>

<h2 id="misery-loves-company">Misery loves company</h2>

<p>You’ll never meet someone more generous than a hard drug user offering a hit of his drugs.</p>

<p>I never used any hard drugs. I was offered heroin, crack, and coke on a few occasions. The dealers weren’t the ones making the offer. It was always a user while they were getting high.</p>

<p>I don’t think something about being a smack or crackhead makes you more altruistic than the general population. I think this is an attempt to normalize their behavior.</p>

<p>If you accept their invitation, it makes them feel a lot better about feeding their addiction in your company.</p>

<h2 id="more-people-are-on-hard-drugs-than-you-think">More people are on hard drugs than you think</h2>

<p>I didn’t learn this directly from living in the projects.</p>

<p>I knew a guy who made home deliveries. One day (in the rash stupidity of youth), I did a ride along with him. I couldn’t come into the house and meet the clients although we were in some pretty nice areas.</p>

<p>Most clients bought “soft” (cocaine). A few wanted “hard” (crack). He told me that most of these people were doctors and lawyers.</p>

<p>This reiterates what I’ve stated earlier about drug dealers being functional individuals. These people can hold down a job (even a damn good one) but they just like to party.</p>

<p>Living next to crackheads and crack dealers is something I will never do again. However, I can’t deny that I’ve learned some things about life that you can’t pay to learn.</p>

    <h2>Get Your Life Together With The Essays of Power</h2>
    <p>I don’t know you, but I know you.</p>

<p>I know that you’re tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no control over the direction of your life.</p>

<p>I know you because I was once you.</p>

<p>I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk, always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment and distraction.</p>

<p>Then one day, I changed my entire life around.</p>

<p>I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the best life I possibly could. I learned how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live with purpose</li>
  <li>Think with clarity</li>
  <li>Face the my demons</li>
  <li>Fix my finances</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I’ve been to the bottom and I clawed my way back out. It wasn’t easy and I wasn’t sure if I’d just become another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous progress.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy way…</p>

<p>One of my coaching clients was designing a program, and came to me with a data-modeling question. The program was for making interactive stories like those Choose Your Own Adventure books. A story contained many passages. In a passage, you might encounter a monster, and then flip to page 62 to fight it, or to page 187 to run away.</p>

<p>He had been choosing between two models. In one, the story contains a list of passages. In the other, each passage has a reference to a story. Which was better?</p>

<p>They have differences in which operations they make easier or more complicated. But I told him that, before even discussing this, or looking at third alternatives: there’s a basic question to answer first:</p>

<p>Do they even represent the same thing?</p>

<p>I smiled as I gave my answer: <i>They are equivalent if passages are immutable, but different if they are mutable.</i></p>

<h2>
Identity</h2>

<p>At first glance, both options seem identical. Option 1 says that a story has many passages. Option 2 says that every passage is associated with a story. It’s a one-to-many-relationship.</p>

<p>Or is it? It’s pretty obvious in Option 2 that no passage can be associated with two stories. But they can be in Option 1 —in the mutable case only.</p>

<p>Why not in the immutable case? You might think that you can create an immutable passage, stick it in two stories, and presto — sharing! But, in the immutable world, one copy used twice is the same as two independent copies.</p>

<p>Think about what happens when you go to implement the “edit passage” screen. In the mutable world, you modify the title and content in-place, and it gets updated in both stories. But in the immutable world, modifying the passage really means making a modified copy, and updating it into the story. It’s copy-on-write. To modify the other story similarly, you’d have to go find it and do the same operation to its passage. It really is a separate copy.</p>

<p>What we’ve seen is a fundamental concept in programming: <i>mutable values have identity</i>. And immutables don’t.</p>

<p>With immutable values, there is no notion of “the same” story or passage beyond “these two have the same values.” There is no way to distinguish between two stories that have the same passage, vs. two stories that have identical copies of the passage. There is no true sharing.</p>

<p>With mutability, the opposite holds. If there are two passages that have the same values, and updating one also updates the other (i.e.: all reads and writes are identical), then they really are the same. Conversely, it’s now possible to have two identical passages which are not the same.</p>

<p>So, the mutable vs. immutable debate is not just about in-place updates vs. modified copies. Immutability means independent parts. Mutability means sharing.</p>

<p>One way to model this is to think of every mutable value as really a pair. The first element of this pair is the value itself. The second element is a magic “token,” created at allocation-time, which is guaranteed to be distinct from every other such token in the program. This explains why, if you do want proper sharing in the immutable world, you’ll need to change your data model to explicitly add some kind of identifier. This, by the way, is one of the reasons why it’s correct to think about immutability as the default, and mutability as an added feature.</p>

<p>
<b>
Bigger Differences</b></p>

<p>In the example above, there’s a simple fix if you like Option 1, but you don’t want sharing between stories: Add an extra rule, or invariant, forbidding sharing. Every rule means extra work to enforce, but this one should be easy. And you still have the option to just not care about sharing.</p>

<p>But adding mutability can mean more pervasive changes to a data model. Here are two more options for passages and stories, in stripped-down form. In Option 3, the story has a start passage, and every passage has a number of successors. In Option 4, we store the edges in reverse, with each passage having a parent.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3:</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4:</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span>Story:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;start: Passage</span></p>

<p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;links: Passage[]</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&lt;content&gt;</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Story:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;passages: Passage[]</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;startIdx: int</span></p>

<p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;parent: optional&lt;Passage&gt;</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&lt;content&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>Extra invariant:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every passage is reachable from the start passage</span></p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>If you squint at it right, when passages are immutable, these are the same. Option 3, naturally, represents trees (no cycles). But, by reversing the arrows, any tree can also be turned into the form of Option 4, so Option 4 also represents trees. This is a convenient lie up until you have to implement any kind of editing, and find that it’s just pretending to be a tree: you’ll need to rebuild large sections on every edit.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3, immutable</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4, immutable</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span><img height="232" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m78lJHFkBmOoysWX-rDggwcQz97kTGT-9dpswe9fSlyy6aENagl_4-UjtHSHeAnrbBghRSSRM_8qL_BKGGdtIGkIswWAeVMj7ApOVEQDKK35Y8qjuaHQBEtSjoV1cauf5LYod1XG" width="298"></span></p>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>But, after adding mutability, Options 3 and 4 become unequivocally not the same. When passages have identity, Option 3 now represents arbitrary graphs with ease. Option 4, meanwhile, now represents these weird graphs that can have cycles, but where every passage can only have one predecessor. Picking between models goes from a game of “which one is more convenient to use” to “which one actually represents a story?”</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3, mutable</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4, mutable</span></p>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p><b>Reversing the Polarity</b></p>

<p>We’ve seen two examples where adding mutability suddenly made two data models different. Is there a case where the story is reversed, and mutability can make two different models the same?</p>

<p>At first I thought there wasn’t — making things mutable just adds distinctions. We need the reverse. But for any rule about data structures, you can often get a reverse rule by putting the data structure in a “negative position” —  that is, as the argument to a function, or as the key to a map. So consider options 5 and 6, this time representing just passages:<b></b></p><div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 5:</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 6:</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;title: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;content: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;summary: string</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;title: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;content: string</span></p>

<p><span>Global:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;summary: Map&lt;Passage, string&gt;</span></p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Here, we want to track some extra information on a passage. Perhaps you want to add some auxiliary information like the Chinese translation or a summary. Or perhaps you want to compute some property of all the passages, like how many steps till the end of the story, and you need to cache the intermediate results. The most straightforward way is adding an extra field. But another approach is to create a hashmap elsewhere associated each passage to some extra data. This pattern is often necessary when extending third-party APIs. And it only works when the objects are mutable.</p>

<p>Option 5 is always straightforward: each passage gets an extra string. But with immutable passages, Option 6 has an extra restriction: there cannot be two passages with the same title and content, but a different summary. Database people call this a functional dependency.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can hack it by making the map check for pointer-equality anyway, but chances are you’re breaking the assumptions of the rest of your code. Immutable code usually moves and copies objects willy-nilly, meaning that “the same object” will have different memory addresses over time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when passages are mutable, you can think of every passage as coming with a magic token that distinguishes it from others with the same values. And so, that hashmap really does just mean that every passage gets some extra data.<a href="#1" name="top1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><span>The True Relationship</span></p>

<p>In software design, the first step is to<a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/making-bugs-impossible-illustrating.html"> discover the essence of the concepts you are implementing</a>. I wrote in the first paragraph that a story contains many passages, so the basic idea is that a story contains passages, right?</p>

<p>Too fast. Since it makes sense to speak of a passage without a story, neither direction is more primitive. The primitive idea is just that the one-to-many relationship exists. If you were modeling stories in a database, the standard approach is to have a table just for storing the stories-passages relationship, separate from the tables for stories and passages. You can get the passages for a story, and the story for a passage. The relationship knows no direction.</p>

<p>How do you express this in a program? In 1987, a researcher at General Electric <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Relations-as-Semantic-Constructs-in-an-Language-Rumbaugh/ca82d99f69ad34371288e06ab1d6cf264d4319e9">came up with an idea</a> for a new style of programming in which relationships between objects can be created and manipulated as easily as the objects themselves. There’s been an uptick in the past decade, but first-class relationships still haven’t caught on even in the research world, and so I promise your language doesn’t have them. We can’t put the idea of a story-passage relationship directly into the program. We have to make do.</p>

<p><span><img height="380" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/esxNkC39bU3TSuC0UGkY8377Fv-ZrXDWz1xo7ex2z_gDzZZwZqgVlKZY7I51fCDE-raCYLl1FacErF6T1X9IF3vEwA9-_9grzyjHxXw9kio-wfT1sP54YB6-qDh53P38G92CO15T" width="624"></span></p>


<p>In databases, when you find yourself often using something in one table to look up things in another, you can speed things up by <i>denormalizing</i> the structure, fusing two tables together. In one possible denormalization, you fuse the Story-Passages table into the Stories table, giving each story a list of passages. In another denormalization, you fuse the Story-Passages table into Passages, giving each Passage a reference to its containing story. The two denormalizations correspond to the original Options 1 and 2 at the top of this post. (A third denormalization fuses Story-Passages into both.)</p>

<p>And now, we see that the reasons to choose one over the other are the same as the reasons to denormalize a table. For the choice between the <span>passages</span> and the <span>story</span> fields, it’s a matter of how often each would be accessed. Since data tends to be accessed hierarchically, I’d expect the need to fetch all the passages of a story to be great, and the need to work with a passage of an unknown story to be slight. This suggests Option 1 (well, Option 1 + more fields you need to actually write this app). But know that both are denormalizations of the true relationship.</p>

<p>Disqus is a free commenting system and a great example of "if you're not paying for it, you become the product".

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>After doing a little searching, I’ve found it’s a little difficult to understand the differences between strongly typed, weakly typed, dynamically typed, and statically typed programming languages. I’d like to clear that up.</p>

<p>First, let’s define what typing is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In programming languages, a type system is a <strong>collection of rules</strong> that assign a property called a type to the various constructs—such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—a computer program is composed of. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. <strong>This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two important pieces to pull from the definition. The first is that a type system is a collection of rules. The second is that checking for the rules can apply at different times.</p>

<p>Here’s what we can deduce so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strongly typed - many rules</li>
<li>Weakly typed - few rules</li>
<li>Dynamically typed - rules applied at run time</li>
<li>Statically typed - rules applied at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an extremely helpful post by <a href="http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2011/07/11/dynamic-typing-is-not-weak-typing/">Naresh Jain</a> that includes this diagram:</p>

<p><a href="http://josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png"><img src="http://www.josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png" alt="strongweakstaticdynamic_type"></a></p>

<p>Naresh’s image shows that there are different degrees of typing. There are languages that have more rules (more strongly typed) than others.</p>

<p>Here’s another definition from Wikipedia that explains a strongly typed language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Liskov and Zilles described a strong-typed language as one in which “whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.” Jackson wrote, “In a strongly typed language each data area will have a <strong>distinct type</strong> and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this definition, PHP is NOT a strongly typed language because you can pass multiple variable types to the same function. Let’s take a look at this example of PHP:</p>

<pre><code>// Pass the integer 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo(4));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo('4'));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: Fatal error: Unsupported operand types
var_dump(foo(array(4)));

// Argument does not have a distinct type
function foo($bar)
{
    // Return the value + 5
    return $bar + 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the function, foo(), does not specify a distinct type for argument $bar so a programmer can pass any type of variable. The first time the function is called, the integer of 4 is passed and returns an integer of 9. The second time the function is called, the string of 4 is passed and again returns an integer of 9. The third and final time the function is called, an array containing an integer of 4 is passed and results in a Fatal Error.</p>

<p>The example above shows PHP is weakly typed and dynamically typed. In terms of the number of rules, PHP uses strings and integers interchangeably so there are “less rules”. Therefore, PHP is considered a weakly typed language. PHP is also dynamically typed because the rules are applied at run time instead of at compile time since PHP is not compiled and instead interpreted at run time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> PHP does support type hinting which makes it less weakly typed/more strongly typed, yet it is still considered a weakly typed language because you cannot use type hinting for integers or strings.</p>

<p>In summary, here are how I see the different types defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - types cannot be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Weakly typed</strong> - types can be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> - types are checked at run time</li>
<li><strong>Statically typed</strong> - types are checked at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this clears up a few things.</p>

  <h5>February 4, 2021</h5>



  
  
  

  


  <p>I recently got stoned for the first time in several years with Caleen. Whoa buddy. Like no time had passed at all. Instantly back where I was when I was a 24/7 stoner (about from 2007 to 2015).</p>
<p>I thought I might try to write about what it’s like for me. I think everyone’s experience is distinct, like a fingerprint of your soul. Caleen and I talked about it a little bit. She just always gets giggly. Not me. Sometimes, but unfortunately not usually.</p>
<p>Almost the first thing that hits me is the overwhelming sense of <em>being</em>. Like… simply the fact of existence and sensory input is too much to bear. In normal day life this is not a problem, of course how else could I function? My god, thinking back.. how <em>did</em> I function stoned all the time? The answer is there in my memory and it is this: <em>with great difficulty</em>. I never gave up trying. Out of maybe thousands of deeply conflicted confrontations with the nature of my existence in this reality, I never let go and never gave up on the fact that whether I like it or not <em>it is</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure the adjective “horrifying” is something that will make sense without some expansion. And I guess that’s kind of central to my experience. If I can explain why it is horrifying, then maybe I can understand it better.</p>
<p>Let’s start with focusing on a single sensory input. Vision, let’s say. That’s usually the first thing I become hyper aware of- and I think it makes sense, being sort of the most primary of human senses.</p>
<p>When I got high the other night, almost immediately I became hyper aware of my sense of vision. Being aware isn’t itself scary, of course. Being a naturally inquisitive person, and especially under the influence, I start to ask questions. Almost every single time. Why do I have vision? What am I seeing here? It’s in moments like this where questions like this aren’t satisfied by answers like “Well, photons are massless particles (bosons, actually) that travel at the maximum speed limit of the universe whose wave combination behavior can be described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. And because our eyes are photosensitive, the energy conveyed by a photon interacting with our eyes results in the experience of color”.</p>
<p>No, I hyperfocus on what <em>experience</em> is. And it gets me into trouble. If I can describe it in computer science terms it might be something like a recursion stack overflow. It’s deeply unsettling, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Even sober, sometimes I get into this mood I think most philosophers and scientists in the history of the world must get at some point. It’s fascinating to be able to describe a feature of reality with such detail.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t really get at the heart of, like, <em>why though</em>?</p>
<p>Most experimental physicists I’ve ever read say something along the lines of  “Yeah, it’s crazy. But all we can do is report what we find even if it seems insane.” So, my stoned mind <em>really</em> wants to think more about this, presumably under the impression that the effects of a plant no less a child of the universe than it can help connect it better to its true nature. Sober minds far more educated than mine can’t make sense of it. Maybe altering the perception of reality can help. And honestly, sometimes it feels like you finally have it figured it out only your brain is so distorted you have no human way of communicating it even to your later sober self. But that’s not when things are scary, that’s more of a “Well that’s too bad, but also remember the time you left a very important post it note to yourself that said ‘they observe you when you observe them’? Yeah, man. Great stoner thought.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot of paths a mind in an altered state can wander when asking questions like this. One of them is to doubt the fabric of reality altogether. That’s maybe the scariest one, because when you start to think that maybe your experience is really just a virtual reality helmet inside an inception style simulation inside the <em>real</em> reality… and critically <em>you begin to actually believe this</em> well… scary ideas can become scary reality quickly.</p>
<p>One of the ways I’ve managed this in the past, and it came in handy the other night is to force myself to acknowledge the inputs of my senses <em>and only the inputs of my senses</em> as reality. My thoughts are complicated machinations informed by and developed around decades of a mixture of pleasure and abuse, and therefore the primary thing <em>not</em> to trust.</p>
<p>If what I see <em>right now</em> is a woman offering nice words and calming behavior, I choose to trust that. My inner turmoil about how well I <em>actually</em> know this woman I have been close friends for a decade is garbage. That is a symptom of an unwell mind, possibly (obviously) one under the influence of an intoxicant. What is real <em>right now</em> is Caleen being a good friend. What my mind is doing is playing tricks with my senses. Given that it’s kind of hard to exist outside of one’s own mind, when it start playing tricks it can be really hard to realize it.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem obvious. And it is, from a place of sobriety. But in the moment when your mind is doing these things (you sort of asked it to do) your mind is telling you every single thing your senses are telling you are potential lies. The only way to win is maintain a part of your mind that questions everything, even itself. That concept only raises more questions. “How can a piece of a mind exist outside itself?” If minds are in anyway similar to a computer, well it’s not unlike asking a computer to report its current CPU usage. Which processes are dominating. Silicon can do, why shouldn’t neurons?</p>
<p>But nothing I’ve described answers what I call the question of experience, also known as the hard question of consciousness. And maybe nothing ever will. It is, after all, at the heart of what millenia of philosophy, religion, and science have been asking.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to paint a relatable picture of what it’s like for me. In actuality, it can be vastly more intense than doubting a friendship, or even reality. Imagine the kinds of things that you could let your mind replace reality if you let it. That’s what makes it truly horrifying, when every aspect of reality comes into question. From your fridge to your fingers to your friends.</p>
<p>Now, I’d love to dig into why my experience is not consistently giggily like Caleen’s, but I’m afraid that touches on some personal stuff I’m not ready to get into right now. Suffice it to say, it’s a mix of my experiences in life and a deliberate combination of no fear and punishment gluttony.</p>
<p>I would normally never publish something like this, but I’m getting into a stage of life where I think I’m pretty clearly safe to do so. And that is refreshingly nice to be able to say.</p>

As "the railrodder", Keaton crosses Canada from east to west on a railway track speeder. True to Keaton's genre, the film is full of sight gags as our protagonist putt-putts his way to British Columbia. Not a word is spoken throughout, and Keaton is as spry and ingenious at fetching laughs as he was in the old days of the silent slapsticks.

<h2 id="the-advent-of-samesite">The advent of <code>SameSite</code> <a href="#the-advent-of-samesite">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have no doubt heard of the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute</a>.
It made headlines when, in February 2020,
Chrome started rolling out changes to <code>SameSite</code>’s default behaviour;
Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed suit</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>Intended as a defense-in-depth mechanism against cross-site attacks,
such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</a>
and <a href="https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)</a>,
<code>SameSite</code> had been lying dormant at the heart of implementing browsers
since <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its inception in 2016</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/samesite-cookie-changes-in-february.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code>’s activation in early 2020</a>
required labourious adjustments
by some websites to maintain third-party access,
but was widely hailed as a welcome addition to browser defences.
Both in anticipation and in reaction to <code>SameSite</code>’s activation in browsers,
posts started
sprouting on blogs all over the Web to spread the word
about the mechanics of the “new” cookie attribute.</p>
<h2 id="playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">Playing fast and loose with terminology <a href="#playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some of those posts were of admirable precision,
such as <a href="https://twitter.com/rowan_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rowan Merewood</a>’s <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev piece</a>
entitled “SameSite cookies explained”.
Unfortunately, relatively few of the posts about <code>SameSite</code>
went to the effort of clarifying the concept of <em>site</em>,
from which the concepts of <em>same-site request</em> and <em>cross-site request</em>
are of course derived.</p>
<p>Moreover, many posts,
including those produced by influential members of the infosec community,
appeared to use the terms “origin” and “site” interchangeably or, at least,
somewhat loosely.</p>
<p>Back in February 2019, Kristian Bremberg <a href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/02/05/guide-http-security-headers-for-better-web-browser-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote the following</a>
on the venerable Detectify blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SameSite attribute is rather new and provides excellent protection
against CSRF attacks. If a cookie uses the SameSite attribute,
the web browser will make sure that the request made with the cookie came
from the <strong>origin</strong> that sat [sic] the cookie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Infosec superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> himself,
in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seminal post</a> entitled
“Promiscuous Cookies and Their Impending Death via the SameSite Policy”
and published in early January 2020, described the effects of the different
<code>SameSite</code> attribute values as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>None: what Chrome defaults to today without a SameSite value set</li>
<li>Lax: some limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
<li>Strict: tight limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>And a few months later, in an otherwise fascinating <a href="https://blog.reconless.com/samesite-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
analysing how the advent of <code>SameSite</code> was affecting a range of vulnerabilities
cherished by hackers,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xReconless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconless team</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the update, all cookies without an explicit <code>SameSite</code> attribute will
be treated as having <code>SameSite=Lax</code>.
This means <strong>cross-origin</strong> requests no longer carry cookies,
except for top-level navigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p><em>Domain</em>, <em>host</em>, <em>origin</em>, <em>site</em>…
Using those terms loosely in informal communication is natural;
such laxity in the use of terminology can be forgiven,
and if you’ve been guilty of it yourself, you’re in good company.</p>
<h2 id="are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">Are “site” and “origin” interchangeable? <a href="#are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">¶</a></h2>
<p>However, the advent of the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute raises some questions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a careful distinction between “origin” and “site” warranted, here?</li>
<li>Is it just a distinction without a difference?</li>
<li>Is a <em>cross-site</em> request no different from a <em>cross-origin</em> request?</li>
<li>Could the cookie attribute have as well been named “SameOrigin”, then?</li>
<li>Or, if there is indeed a real difference between “site” and “origin”,
does it matter to practitioners?</li>
<li>And, if the difference does matter, how so?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have already guessed the answers from the title of this post:
“site” has a very technical meaning in the context of <code>SameSite</code>,
yet it is unduly neglected;
and the distinction between <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> <em>does</em> matter,
yet the two concepts are frequently conflated.</p>
<p>This lapse in terminology didn’t escape everyone.
That Google’s <em>Developer Advocate of Web</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/agektmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eiji Kitamura</a>
felt the need to dedicate
a whole <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
about the distinction between “origin” and “site”,
only a few months after Chrome activated <code>SameSite</code>, is revealing.</p>
<p>In order to understand why the distinction matters,
you first need to understand the difference between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-origin">What do we mean by “origin”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-origin">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work with Web technologies,
you have at least some familiarity with the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</a>,
arguably one of the main pillar of Web security.
The concept of <em>origin</em> of a URI is of course central to the SOP and,
as such, it is relatively well-understood.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.2 of RFC 6454</a> defines an <em>origin</em> as a triple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly speaking, two URIs are part of the same origin
(i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
scheme, host, and port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The port is optional; if not specified, the default port associated to the scheme
is implied (e.g. 80 for <code>http</code> and 443 for <code>https</code>).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Glossary/Origin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN Web Docs</a> has a series of useful examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-site">What do we mean by “site”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-site">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behind the painfully generic term that is “site”
hides a concept fundamentally more difficult to grasp
than that of <em>origin</em>.
For one thing, the term “site” was not always a technical one:
it predates the SOP and was in in common use
<a href="https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when attacks like cross-site scripting came onto the scene</a>.
Furthermore, the modern concept of <em>site</em> is fraught with technical difficulties.
It is intimately linked to that of a host’s <em>registrable domain</em>,
which the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-registrable-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Living Standard</a> defines as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a domain formed by the most specific public suffix,
along with the domain label immediately preceeding it, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A host’s registrable domain is also known as its “eTLD+1”, short for
“effective top-level domain plus one”.)</p>
<p>In the simplest of cases, <strong>the site of an origin simply corresponds
to the registrable domain (if any) of the origin’s host</strong>.</p>
<p>Two examples, to fix ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site of <code>https://www.example.org</code> is <code>example.org</code>,
because <code>org</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>example.org</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
<li>The site of <code>https://jub0bs.github.io</code> is <code>jub0bs.github.io</code>,
because <code>github.io</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>jub0bs.github.io</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! Perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>github.io</code> is a public suffix</a>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the concept of registrable domain is a fluid one,
because it relies on the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public-Suffix List</a>,
a list which is not set in stone but <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to change over time</a>.
Not to mention that different browsers may not necessarily stay abreast of
changes to the Public-Suffix list at the same pace.</p>
<p>The technicalities do not end there!
As <a href="https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev warns us</a>,
the concept of <em>site</em> is still evolving and
will soon incorporate the scheme also.
The change currently sits behind a flag in Chrome but will soon be rolled out.
However, to sidestep this difficulty and prolong the relevance of this post,
I’ll only consider origins whose scheme is <code>https</code> in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">Same-site vs. cross-site requests <a href="#same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dealt with the concept of <em>site</em>,
we can finally discuss the concepts of <em>same-site</em> and <em>cross-site</em> requests.
A given request is either <em>same-site</em> or <em>cross-site</em>.
Whether a request is same-site or cross-site depends on the comparison
between the sites of the request’s source origin and target origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two sites are identical, the request is said to be <em>same-site</em>;</li>
<li>If the two sites are different, the request is said to be <em>cross-site</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site,
because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.github.io</code>
to <code>https://bar.github.io</code> is cross-site,
because the site of the first origin is <code>foo.github.io</code>,
whereas the site of the second origin is <code>bar.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.bar.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site, because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve made it this far down the present post, I thank you for your patience.
Take heart: the payoff is near!</p>
<h2 id="cross-origin-same-site-requests">Cross-origin, same-site requests <a href="#cross-origin-same-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>All cross-site requests are necessarily cross-origin; that much is clear.
However, as shown by the first and third examples above,
not all cross-origin requests are cross-site.</p>
<p><img src="https://jub0bs.com/images/cor_vs_csr.svg" alt="Venn-diagram"></p>
<p>And the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is only concerned with cross-site requests;
it has no effect on cross-origin requests that happen to be same-site.
This is why the distinction between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em> is important.</p>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo <a href="#online-demo">¶</a></h2>
<p>To prove my point,
I’ve drawn inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt’s post</a> and
I’ve deployed a simple Go server to <code>samesitedemo.jub0bs.com</code> composed
of two simple endpoints.
Endpoint <code>/setcookie</code> sets a <code>SameSite=Strict</code> cookie, like so</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>Set-Cookie: StrictCookie=foo; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict
</span></code></pre></div><p>Endpoint <code>/readcookie</code> prints the cookie (if any) attached to the request.
I’ve also set up two “attacking” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both pages simply consist in a single link to
<code>https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/readcookie</code>.</p>
<p>To fix ideas, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie</a>.
Doing so will set the <code>Strict</code> cookie in your browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the attacking URI (<code>jub0bs.github.io</code>)
is different from that of the target URI (<code>jub0bs.com</code>),
the browser does not attach the cookie to the request resulting from
following the link, and no cookie gets printed in the response.
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as expected, and the “attack” is foiled.</li>
<li>Now navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><strong>Notes Taken: 2021-01-28</strong></p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0">GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Martin explains there are several different understandings of what Event-Driven Architecture is. All of these are valid but are distinct in their actual form. Martin delves into four of these.</p>
<p>At a high level, there is a difference between events and commands.
Events explain, 'something <strong>has</strong> happened', the receiver is free to ignore the event or do something in response to the event occurring.
Commands explain, 'something <strong>should</strong> happen', the producer of the command has to know what command to issue.
Events and commands are both valid, the disadvantage of commands is that the producer has to know which system wants to react to a command, and the producer must issue the appropriate command - arguably this creates more coupling.</p>
<p>The four patterns of Event-Driven Architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Notification</li>
<li>Event Carried State Transfer</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pattern-1-event-notification">Pattern 1: Event Notification</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=200s">Timecode - 3:20</a></p>
<p>Martin pictures a system where a user changes their address in the <strong>Customer Management System</strong>, this should cause the&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Quoting System</strong> to calculate a new quote for the customer. In a classic model, the customer management system must call out to the Insurance Quoting System to order a requote. This creates a strong coupling, in particular the Customer Management System is dependent on the Insurance Quoting System. This is likely suboptimal as the Insurance Quoting System is a more specialised and less general system than the Customer Management System; Martin argues dependencies should usually be drawn from specialised systems to more general systems. Instead of calling from the Customer Management System to the Insurance Quoting System, the Customer Management System could publish an event 'CustomerAddressChange' to a queue, and the Insurance Quoting System could listen for these events and requote the customer when it receives the event. This effectively alters a coupling of&nbsp;'<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Insurance Quoting System</em>' into&nbsp;<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Event Queue &lt;- Insurance Quoting System</em>.
This is the most basic of event architectures, it simply alters the way dependencies can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-2-event-carried-state-transfer">Pattern 2: Event Carried State Transfer</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=893s">Timecode - 14:53</a></p>
<p>A less common pattern. Built atop Event Notification, when we receive an event, we pull the data from the Customer Management System and store the relevant parts in our own database. This means the Insurance Quoting System can stay available, even when the Customer Management System goes down. The problem is we now have to copies of data so we lose consistency.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-3-event-sourcing">Pattern 3: Event Sourcing</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=1251s">Timecode - 20:51</a></p>
<p>The previous two patterns are largely still CRUD, when we make a change, we save it to a database,&nbsp;<strong>overwriting</strong> the previous value and maybe publishing an event.
Event Sourcing changes this, we both overwrite the current state but we also log an event to an event log.
We now have a system with two forms of state, the <strong>application state</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The application state is the point in time state, which can be recovered from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The standard for an event sourcing system, is that at any point in time the application state can be destroyed and we can&nbsp;<strong>reliably recover</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
In Event Sourcing, we move from being oriented around application state, with events as an optional extra, to being oriented around a log of all events, with application state derived from that log.</p>
<p>Developers are constantly using an example of an event sourcing program, almost all vcs systems such as git are event sourced.
The current commit/working state is the application state, and branches, commits, etc are all just events in the event log.
For business people, an accounting system makes for a good analogy to an event sourced system.
The current balance of accounts is the application state, but the series of entries in the ledger is the set of events that are used to construct that state.</p>
<p>One great benefit of Event Sourcing is that we can change the models of application state at any time, and fully reconstruct from our event log. Instead of writing database migrations when data models change, like we do in the SQL world, we just change how state is derived from events. We can even test systems in a read only mode against production, by reading the event log to construct a new application state. One key advantage Martin mentions is that Event Sourcing enables a 'Memory Image'. This essentially means that our application state can be completely ephemeral, and in memory; you don't need a database for application state, you only need to read from the event log and construct the application state in memory. This can be very fast and performant. The other benefit of this is that memory is super fast, and you can essentially avoid database calls, whilst having persistence. Martin mentions, think about the opportunities opening up here as we begin to see more and more systems with high amounts of RAM or super fast non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p>There are added complexities. Consider how you can order events reliably. Consider how you ensure transactional guarantees, if you write to the event log, you must also update the application state at the same time. You can't update application state before writing to the event log because then you have a working state that is ahead of the event log state, and remember, the event log state is the source of truth. Event Sourcing systems generally bring asynchrony with them, and this can add quite a bit of complexity. You must also consider consistency, what does it mean to write to the event log, if other systems are going to react to those events, they will not be consistent at the point of time you write to the event log. This is a trade off with all event driven architectures however.</p>
<p>Martin mentions in passing that he is very surprised by how uncommon Event Sourcing is in practice.</p>
<p>Martin brings forward a final and very important consideration when Event Sourcing. We must carefully consider which events are worth storing, and which are not. Suppose there is a service that receives an order to 'buy 15 widgets', the service then creates a transaction that is stored in the application state, this transaction contains additional info like the tax applied and any discounts applied. The service could persist an event with the business logic derived details, such as tax and discounts, or an event that most closely mirrors the input request. The advantage of the former is that the event log contains a more precise record of what was computed at the time the request was received, the advantage with the latter is that it contains only the bare minimum required to recompute the application state, and nothing more. In practice, many systems persist both types of events. Greg Young says that there should be no business logic between your events and your application state.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-4-command-query-responsibility-segregation">Pattern 4: Command Query Responsibility Segregation</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=2611s">Timecode - 43:31</a></p>
<p>Martin warns outright, this is a complex pattern that is more often than not implemented incorrectly, and can cause troubles if so. The idea here is to separate out the write (command) path from the read (query) path of your system. This is particularly useful when you have an application that is read from much more frequently than it is read from, especially if the reads are of a form derived from the write form.</p>

<section id=""><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Bathed in light, the world remains our first and last love.” —Albert Camus</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone writing seriously about utopia in September of 2020 will seem—to be charitable—a little disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>The American West is burning. The Arctic is melting. Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Nearly a million people have died from the coronavirus. Economic inequality continues to grow, only accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>If there’s anything like a road to utopia—if we can even begin to entertain such an idea—we don’t seem to be on it. The belief that society’s problems can be solved seems ridiculous when each day brings fresh horrors. Our collective failure to make so much as a dent on climate change, the cancerous spread of polarizing misinformation with its fracturing of society, and the irretrievable damage we are inflicting on the biosphere, only deepen a sense that the best we can hope for now is adaptation and survival in an environment increasingly hostile (physically, psychologically, spiritually) to the individual.</p>
<p>But hope, as “Mad” Max Rockatansky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN4sboc7E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us from the other side of collapse</a>, is a mistake, and despair paralyzes. What we need are viable alternatives. Alternatives that go beyond bolt-on fixes to broken systems. Alternatives we can imagine living—and thriving—in. And most importantly, alternatives we can look for in our present and in our past, not in some idealized future.</p>
<p>Utopia is in the air again, though few dare call it by that name. Ideas that would be dismissed just a few short years ago as “utopian”—a word that has been cut down to pejorative status—are entering into the mainstream. Political programs like the Green New Deal promise solutions that could spare us from the worst effects of climate change while stimulating the economy. Universal Basic Income and its brethren suggest how we might mend broken social safety nets and ease economic inequality. But what we lack, and urgently need, is a vision of the world we want to bring into being. That’s all utopianism is: the audacity to imagine the world we want, and then living as though that world were possible.</p>
<p>Metals become malleable when subjected to heat. In higher temperatures, they melt, making it possible to cast existing forms into new shapes. Culture I/O is premised on a belief that under certain conditions, the malleability of our society increases as well. The coming decade, more than any other in recent memory, will be turbulent and heated. In the words of Arundhati Roy: <em>“We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</em> </p>
<p>The Culture I/O Working Group<br>
Los Angeles &amp; Berlin, 09/2020</p>

<p>A guide to utopia has to start with a foundation of all the concepts feeding into it: ourselves, nature, technology, society, and the other Big Things. It’s easier to go on a journey together if we all leave from the same place.</p>

<section id="individuals"><div><h3><span>1. Individuals</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“I am neither a liberal nor a conservative…. My holy of holies is the human body, health, intelligence, talent, inspiration, love, and absolute freedom.” —Anton Chekhov</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A society consists of individuals. Only individuals suffer, experience joy, love, longing, pleasure, pain, act with intent, die. They can do so collectively, but always and only as individuals. <strong>In the end, only individuals matter.</strong></li>
<li>This is an ontological position, not a value judgement. A family or society exists only insofar as its individual members exist.</li>
<li>Because of this, we should reject any ideology that stresses the primacy of a group at the expense of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, we should reject any ideology that places a system (such as markets) above individuals.</li>
<li>This should not be taken as an endorsement of individualism. Individuals do not exist in isolation. The point is simply that we should always treat individuals as <em>ends</em>, never as <em>means</em>.</li>
<li>Humans are complex, emotional, self-aware animals with a degree of free will—not rational agents, logic machines, or biological algorithms.</li>
<li>Humans are not the only complex, emotional, self-aware animals on this planet.</li>
<li>The quickest path to dooming any human undertaking is to assume that we can become, or even reliably pretend to be, anything other than what we are—both at our best and at our worst.</li>
</ul>

<section id="minds"><div><h3><span>2. Minds</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Use your head, can’t you, use your head, you’re on earth, there’s no cure for that!” —Samuel Beckett</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The human brain is the most mysterious and versatile physical structure in the known world. We know more about how the universe came to be than how the brain works.</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between brain, mind, and consciousness is the greatest scientific question of our time.</li>
<li>Though we are emotional creatures first and foremost, we are wired for reason. Using only his mind and some crude observations, Aristarchus of the Greek island of Samos figured out that the Earth orbits the Sun almost 2,000 years before this became accepted fact. Einstein produced four of his groundbreaking papers in one year spent hunched over a desk in a musty Bern patent office, with reason as his only instrument.</li>
<li>In spite of these impressive abilities, we are extremely susceptible to biases and fallacies in our thinking—and to those who would exploit these biases.</li>
<li>The either/or fallacy is one of the most pernicious of these errors, passed down to us by Aristotle. It suggests that everything must be either this, or that. Good or bad. Nature or nurture. Introvert or extrovert. Liberal or conservative. It is the binary logic of machines applied to an analog world full of semantic nuance, contradiction, and mystery. If we are, on a species-level, in trouble, it is in large part because of our inability to internalize the fact that multiple ideas which seem opposed to each other can simultaneously be true.</li>
<li>This does not mean that truth is relative. It isn’t. Only that out in the world, truth is more complicated than it seems. If we simplify the world in order to function in it, we do so at our peril.</li>
</ul>

<section id="language"><div><h3><span>3. Language</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“The map is not the territory.” —Alfred Korzybski</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Words are not reality—they represent abstractions that allow us to make sense of reality, to think and talk about it.</li>
<li>This is important because it means that words do not and cannot map perfectly to reality, and that different languages—systems of words—can reflect reality in subtly different ways.</li>
<li>Words matter. Words and mind are inextricably linked and together they create the feedback loop that makes reasoning possible.</li>
<li>The abuse of language is a form of psychological abuse. George Orwell memorably took it to task in <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Politics and the English Language</em></a> three quarters of a century ago, but we’ve been at it for much, much longer. What is new is the degree to which words have saturated our lives. Social media and 24 hour news have made it impossible to escape.</li>
<li>Precision and clarity are how we push back against the abuse of language. Because we use words to think, choosing them with care leads to clearer arguments and thoughts. We should always strive to practice good linguistic hygiene, and to use language in good faith—for our own sanity, if nothing else.</li>
<li>Where pushing back is impossible, we must step away. Silence can be a virtue.</li>
<li>The only way to have a productive discussion involving abstractions (democracy, justice, utopia) is to clearly and rigorously define them first. Often we’ll find that the discussion ends up fixating on the definitions of the words themselves. This is a good thing.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We are surrounded by and enmeshed in systems.</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of systems helps us to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world.</li>
<li>Societies are systems. Culture is a system. Governments, markets, weather, language, and the biosphere are all examples of systems.</li>

<p>Moritz Systems have started a new contract with the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation
</a> to continue our work on modernizing
the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> debugger’s support for <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  Throughout the previous contract we have
introduced a FreeBSD Remote Process Plugin utilizing the mode modern
client-server layout of LLDB.</p>
<p>We have managed to achieve the feature parity with the original FreeBSD
plugin on the x86 architecture.  However, as of today other
architectures still use the original.  During the next two months,
we are going to work on bringing the remaining previously supported
architectures to the new layout, with special focus on providing first
class support for ARM64 (also known as AArch64) architecture.  Afterwards, we are going to
continue improving FreeBSD support in LLDB.</p>
<p>The complete Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each
taking approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD
Remote-Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs,
marking the non-trivial ones for future work.  Remove the old
local-only Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with
the GNU GDB support.  Cover the functionality with LLDB regression
tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance
the regression testing of core files in LLDB.  Update the FreeBSD
manual.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-compiling-lldb-to-other-freebsd-architectures">Cross-compiling LLDB to other FreeBSD architectures</h2>
<h3 id="a-short-introduction-to-cross-compilation">A short introduction to cross-compilation</h3>
<p>Cross-compilation is a technique permitting to use a compiler running
on one platform to create executables for another platform.  It can
be used to build software for another CPU architecture (e.g. ARM64
executables on an x86 system) or e.g. for another operating system
(e.g. FreeBSD packages from Linux), or both.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cross-compilation is to use a single
development environment to produce executables for multiple target
platforms.  What’s really important for our case, it permits building
software much faster than when running a native compiler via an emulator
or on hardware that is much less performant than modern x86 PCs
(e.g. commonly available ARM boards).</p>
<p>An important limitation of cross-compilation is that the resulting
executables cannot be executed on the platform running the compiler.
This means that the tools needed at build-time need to be built
separately – depending on the build system, this either needs to
be done manually or is done automatically as part of cross compilation.
This also means that the build scripts cannot perform tests that
require running the test program.</p>
<p>There are two main prerequisites to cross-compilation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A cross-toolchain, i.e. the compiler and link editor capable
of producing executables for the target platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sysroot, i.e. the system libraries and dependencies compiled
for the target platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preparing-the-cross-compiler-and-sysroot">Preparing the cross-compiler and sysroot</h3>
<p>Ordinarily in order to obtain a cross-toolchain, you need to build
the compiler for a specific target.  However, the Clang compiler
that is used by default on FreeBSD has integrated cross-compilation
support.  Rather than rebuilding the whole compiler for each target,
it is sufficient to ensure that appropriate target support is enabled
at build time.  Therefore, the standard Clang builds on FreeBSD are
sufficient to cross-build for ARM and ARM64.</p>
<p>Cross-compiling a FreeBSD sysroot is very similar to building it
natively.  The only difference is the necessity of passing
a <code>TARGET_ARCH</code> variable specifying the target architecture.
For example, to build arm64 sysroot we run the following commands
in <code>/usr/src</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> buildworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> installworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> distribution TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cross-compiling-llvm">Cross-compiling LLVM</h3>
<p>LLVM is using the CMake build system.  CMake partially facilitates
cross-compilation itself, while the other part is handled
in LLVM-specific CMake files.</p>
<p>The first step towards cross-compiling CMake-based projects is to
create a toolchain file.  This file is used to set some internal CMake
variables that cannot be directly overriden via the command-line.
One toolchain file can be shared between multiple projects, so it is
also a convenient place to set standard cross-related CMake options.</p>
<p>For our purpose, <code>toolchain-arm64.cmake</code> contained the following
variables:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span># Since we are using clang as the compiler and it is the default
</span><span># on FreeBSD, we do not need to override the compiler.  However,
</span><span># we do need to pass a correct -target indicating the platform we're
</span><span># build for and the path to our sysroot.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># While this may seem redundant, setting it explicitly (even to the same
</span><span># value) actually causes CMake to consider itself to be cross-compiling.
</span><span># This is important since LLVM relies on CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING being set.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</span> <span>"FreeBSD"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># Force library search functions to use our sysroot.  Make sure it never
</span><span># uses programs from the sysroot (since we can't execute them).  Headers
</span><span># and libraries have to be taken from sysroot, on the other hand.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</span> <span>"/sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM</span> <span>NEVER</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY</span> <span>ONLY</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</span> <span>ONLY</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to that, a few additional options needed to be passed
to CMake.  The following snippet explains them, in the Bash array form:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir build.arm64
cd build.arm64

args<span>=(</span>
    <span># Path to the source directory</span>

    <span># than Makefiles.</span>
    -G Ninja

<span>)</span>

cmake <span>"</span><span>${</span>args[@]<span>}</span><span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once LLVM is configured this way, the regular <code>ninja</code> calls can be used
to build the project.  The build system will automatically configure
a <code>NATIVE</code> subdirectory containing utilities that need to be executed
during the build, while the rest of the project will be built for ARM64.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-additional-architectures">Working on additional architectures</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-specific-code-in-lldb">Architecture-specific code in LLDB</h3>
<p>While a significant part of <code>ptrace(2)</code> API used by debuggers,
and therefore of the debugger itself is architecture-agnostic,
it is practically impossible to debug programs without specific support
for the processor in question.  For example, the debugger benefits
from support for deassembling the code, generating function calls,
inspecting registers, etc.</p>
<p>A large part of the architecture support is generic and shared between
different operating systems.  Moreover, a part of FreeBSD-specific
architecture support is shared between the legacy and new plugins.
Therefore, in order to extend the new plugin to support additional
architectures we mostly needed to introduce the ‘glue’ binding the new
plugin with the architecture support.  However, we also had to implement
support for inspecting and modifying registers (in more modern form
than used by the legacy plugin), choosing opcodes for software
breakpoints and fix existing bugs in platform support.</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we will discuss shortly the architectures
we were working on, and the specifics that we needed to research
in order to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="ptrace2-register-groups">ptrace(2) register groups</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the <code>ptrace(2)</code> API defines three pairs of requests
for getting and setting registers, effectively splitting the registers
visible to userland programs into three groups: General-Purpose
Registers (GPRs), Floating-Point Unit Registers (FPRs) and Debug
Registers (DRs).</p>
<p>General-Purpose Registers are the baseline set of processor’s registers
exposed to userland programs.  This group includes generic registers
that can be used to store arbitrary data by the program (usually
integers or memory addresses) and special CPU registers with predefined
meaning.  Two common examples of special registers are the Program
Counter that is used to help the memory address of the code being
executed currently, and the flag register that is used to expose part
of the CPU state and boolean results of executed instructions.</p>
<p>The non-special registers also often have functions predefined
by the platform’s ABI.  For example, often one of the registers
is dedicated to be the Stack Pointer.  While the program could
technically use it on some CPUs for another purpose, it must preserve the original value
for interoperability.</p>
<p>Floating-Point Unit Registers are the registers used to store
and perform computation on floating-point numbers.  This class
of registers is only present on processors implementing hardware
floating-point support.</p>
<p>Finally, Debug Registers are special CPU registers used to aid
debuggers.  Usually, they are used to enable hardware-assisted
breakpoints and watchpoints.</p>

<p>ARM is a family CPU architectures maintained by <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM Ltd.</a>, primarily used on embedded platforms.
The processors up to ARMv7 were pure 32-bit.  ARMv8 featured an optional
(though present in the vast majority of ARMv8 processors) 64-bit

<![CDATA[Replicating the literature on meritocratic promotion in China]]>

February 4, 2021 | https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2021/02/replications | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2021/02/replications">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">

	



  <p>China has had double-digit economic growth for nearly three decades. How
can we explain this? In my dissertation, I studied one explanation that
is backed up by a large literature: meritocratic promotion. The idea is
that politicians compete in promotion tournaments, where the politician
with the highest GDP growth rate in their jurisdiction is rewarded by
being promoted. By tying promotion to economic growth, meritocratic
promotion creates strong incentives to boost GDP, and hence helps
explain China’s rapid growth.</p>

<p>When I collected data on prefecture politicians, however, I found no evidence for
meritocracy: there was no correlation between GDP growth and
promotion, despite trying many different models. How is this null result
consistent with the positive findings in the rest of the literature? To
find out, I replicated the main papers claiming evidence for prefecture-level meritocracy. Short answer:
the literature is wrong.</p>

<p>This post summarizes my replications. I find that the results in the
literature are not robust to reasonable specification changes, or are
due to data errors. You can find the full details, and a few more
replications, in the paper <a href="https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-015-9116-1">Yao and Zhang (2015)</a>, published in the Journal of Economic Growth, was
the first paper to study meritocratic promotion at the prefecture level
in China. They estimate a leader’s ability to grow GDP, and then estimate
the relationship between ability and promotion. If promotion is
meritocratic, we should see a positive correlation, as high-growth
leaders are promoted.</p>

<p>However, they find no average correlation between leader ability and
promotion: leaders with higher ability are not more likely to be
promoted. Despite this, the authors do not frame their paper as
contradicting the literature.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Moreover, this paper is cited in the
literature as supporting the meritocracy hypothesis.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This is because the authors further test for an interaction between
leader ability and age, reporting a positive interaction effect that is
significant at the 5% level. Narrowing in on specific age thresholds,
they find that leader ability has the strongest effect on promotion for
leaders older than 51. They conclude that leader ability matters for
older politicians, because more years of experience produces a clearer
signal of ability.</p>

<p>Now, this result is consistent with a limited promotion tournament,
where the Organization Department promotes older leaders based on their
ability to boost growth (because older leaders have clearer signals of
ability), but applies different promotion criteria to younger leaders
(whose signals are too weak to detect). But this limited model
contradicts the usual characterization of China’s promotion tournament
as including all leaders, irrespective of age: in each province, leaders
compete to boost GDP growth, and the winners are rewarded with
promotion.</p>

<p>This is actually a big discrepancy, because half of all promotions occur
for leaders younger than 51. If the Organization Department cannot
measure ability for these young leaders, what criteria does it use to
promote them? Furthermore, remember that the original motivation was to
explain China’s rapid growth. The incentives generated by this limited
tournament are weaker, since the reward is only applied later in life;
if young leaders are impatient, they will discount this future reward
and put less effort into boosting growth. The limited tournament model
has less explanatory power.</p>

<p>At this point, it is not clear to me why this paper has been cited
without qualification as evidence for meritocratic promotion. It offers
no general support for meritocracy, and its model of a limited promotion
tournament partly contradicts the literature.</p>

<p>But I’m not stopping here. Finding a null average effect with a
significant interaction is a classic formula for p-hacked results in
social psychology. Since the age interaction doesn’t make much sense, I
don’t believe that the authors started out planning to run this test.
Rather, it looks like they wanted to find a positive average effect, but
didn’t. But they’d already invested a lot of time in collecting the data
and working out a clever identification strategy, so they found an
interaction that got them statistical significance, even if the
interpretation wasn’t really consistent. Hence, I <a href="https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2020/11/pvalues">reject their p-value
as invalid</a>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>And it turns out that this is the right call. Digging into the paper, I
find that the significant interaction term depends on including
questionable control variables.</p>

<p>When estimating leader ability, the authors regress GDP growth on three
fixed effects (leader, city, year) as well as three covariates: initial
city GDP per capita (by leader term), annual city population, and the
annual provincial inflation rate. I think it makes sense to control for
initial GDP by term. The model includes city effects, so level
differences in growth rates are not an issue. But we might worry that
the variance of idiosyncratic shocks to growth is correlated with city
size, and growth shocks could affect promotion outcomes.</p>

<p>However, it is not clear why population and inflation should be
included. The authors mention that labor migration can drive GDP growth
(p.413), but a leader’s policies affect migration, so population is
plausibly a collider or ‘bad control’, if leader ability affects growth
through good policies that increase migration. The authors provide no
justification for including inflation, which is odd because the
dependent variable (real per capita GDP growth) is already expressed in
real (rather than nominal) terms.</p>

<p>Given the lack of justification for including population and inflation
as covariates, I re-estimate leader ability controlling only for initial
GDP. Using this new estimate of ability, I then replicate their main
results. I again find a nonsignificant average effect of ability on
promotion. But now the interaction with age disappears. The sign remains
positive, but the magnitude of the coefficient drops by half, and the
results are nonsignificant.</p>

<p>So it turns out that Yao and Zhang (2015) offers no evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uez018">Li et al. (2019)</a>, published in the Economic Journal, studies GDP growth
targets and promotion tournaments in China. They start with the
observation that growth targets are higher at lower levels of the
administration; for example, prefectures set higher targets than do
provinces. Their explanation is that the number of jurisdictions
competing in each promotion tournament is decreasing as one moves down
the hierarchy, which increases the probability of a leader winning the
tournament. As a consequence, leaders exert more effort, and
higher-level governments can set higher growth targets without causing
leaders to quit.</p>

<p>As part of their model, they assume that promotion is meritocratic:
performance (measured by GDP growth) increases the probability of
promotion. Further, they report an original result: the effect of
performance on promotion is increasing in the growth target faced. That
is, a one percentage-point increase in growth will increase a mayor’s
chances of promotion by a larger amount when the provincial target
is higher, relative to when the target is lower.</p>

<p>This result seems naturally testable by interacting
\(Growth \times Target\) in a panel regression, with a predicted positive
coefficient on the interaction term. However, the authors argue that OLS
is invalid, instead reporting results based on maximum likelihood where
promotion is determined by a contest success function. Why does OLS not
apply? “Standard linear regression does not work here partly because
promotion is determined by local officials’ own growth rates as well as
by the growth rates of their competitors. The nonlinearity of the
promotion function is another factor that invalidates the OLS
estimation.” (p.2906)</p>

<p>But these are not problems for OLS. First, as is standard in this
literature, the promotion tournament can be captured by using prefecture
growth rates relative to the annual provincial growth rate. Second, OLS
is the best linear approximation to a nonlinear conditional expectation
function. So if there is a positive nonlinear relationship between
promotion and growth, we should be expect that it will be detected by
OLS.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Given the lack of justification for omitting results from linear
regression, I replicate their results using a linear probability model
and logistic regression. First, I test the generic meritocracy
hypothesis. I find that GDP growth has no average effect on promotion.
Next, I do find a positive interaction effect between growth and growth
target, but it’s not statistically significant.</p>

<p>This doesn’t look good for the authors. OLS is the default method, and
you need a strong justification for not reporting it. But their reasons
are flimsy. Now it looks like they tried OLS, didn’t get the result they
wanted, then made up a complicated maximum likelihood model that
delivered significance.</p>

<p>So Li et al. (2019) is another paper that claims to provide evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders, but is unable to back up
those claims.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy027">Chen and Kung (2019)</a>, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
studies land corruption in China, with secondary results on meritocratic
promotion. The main result is that local politicians provide price
discounts on land sales to firms connected to Politburo members, and
these local politicians are in turn rewarded with promotion up the
bureaucratic ladder.</p>

<p>For provincial leaders, they find a strong effect of land sales on
promotion for secretaries, but not for governors. In contrast, GDP
growth strongly predicts promotion for governors, but not secretaries.
They conclude that “the governor has to rely on himself for promotion,
specifically by improving economic performance or GDP growth in his
jurisdiction [...] only the provincial party secretaries are being
rewarded for their wheeling and …</p></div></div>

<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>When the <a href="http://beyondloom.com/blog/thinkc.html">Macintosh</a> was released in 1984, it featured a square-pixeled black-and-white display at a crisp 72 dots per inch. The 512x342 resolution might seem less than impressive today, but for the time it was a pleasantly high-resolution consumer-grade computer. Among other things, the monospaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)">Monaco 9pt</a> bitmap font featured characters that were 6 pixels wide, allowing the Macintosh to render a standard 80-column terminal with ample room for a vertical scrollbar and other niceties.</p>

<p>Beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare">Susan Kare’s</a> brilliant type design and pixel-art icons, a cornerstone of the visual vocabulary of the Macintosh is the use of dithered images. Dithering algorithms use a small palette (in our case, black and white) to represent a larger one (simulated grayscale). Here we will examine two popular techniques: Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and a variation common on the Macintosh, Atkinson dithering.</p>

<h2 id="floyd-steinberg">Floyd-Steinberg</h2>

<p>The central idea of Floyd-Steinberg dithering is <em>error diffusion</em>. When determining the 1-bit color to assign to a given pixel in a grayscale image, quantizing will result in some error- a pixel either <em>darker</em> or <em>lighter</em> than the true grayscale value. By “pushing” this rounding error to neighboring pixels, we can ensure that <em>on average</em> the distribution of black and white in the output image resembles the input. Your eye closes the gap, and reconstructs some of the lost information.</p>

<p>Floyd-Steinberg dithering scans input pixels in a single pass, top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Error left over from each pixel is distributed between neighboring pixels which have not been converted yet, in the following proportions:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="http://beyondloom.com/blog/dither-figures/floyd.png">
	<figcaption>Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Suppose we have the <em>[0.0,1.0]</em> grayscale values of an image in an array <code>pixels</code> and the width of the image <code>w</code>, and we wish to generate an array of <em>{0,1}</em> output pixels. If we are permitted to mutate <code>pixels</code> in-place, a JavaScript implementation of the algorithm might look something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>function floyd(pixels,w) {
	const m=[[1,7],[w-1,3],[w,5],[w+1,1]]
	for (let i=0; i&lt;pixels.length; i++) {
		const x=pixels[i], col=x&gt;.5, err=(x-col)/16
		m.forEach(([x,y]) =&gt; i+x&lt;pixels.length &amp;&amp; (pixels[i+x]+=err*y))
		pixels[i]=col
	}
	return pixels
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given a <em>mask</em> (<code>m</code>) of relative offsets to neighbor pixels and the proportion of error they should get, we map over our pixels in order. The <em>color</em> at each pixel (<code>col</code>) is a simple quantization of the grayscale value (<code>x&gt;.5</code>), the <em>error</em> (<code>err</code>) is the difference between this quantized value and the original, and we simply add a fraction of that error to neighbor pixels before returning <code>col</code>.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Note that in this implementation error diffused from the right edge of the image will bleed into the left edge of the following row. The inherent noisyness of dithering makes this aesthetically irrelevant, and doing so simplifies the implementation. Everyone wins!</p>

<p>If we wanted to avoid modifying <code>pixels</code> in-place, we could observe that the accumulated error we care about would fit in a fixed-size circular buffer (<code>e</code>) proportional to the width of our image. The result is slightly more complex, but in some ways conceptually cleaner, since our main loop is now a <code>map()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function floyd2(pixels,w) {
	const e=Array(w+1).fill(0), m=[[0,7],[w-2,3],[w-1,5],[w,1]]
	return pixels.map(x =&gt; {
		const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix&gt;.5, err=(pix-col)/16
		m.forEach(([x,y]) =&gt; e[x]+=err*y)
		return col
	})
}
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>Array.shift()</code> and <code>Array.push()</code> are used here for conciseness; use your imagination for a more efficient low-level implementation.)</p>

<h2 id="atkinsonsalgorithm">Atkinson’s Algorithm</h2>

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> developed a variation of the above technique which produces results that are subjectively nicer-looking. The basics work the same, but error is spread in a broader pattern, and only 3/4ths of the error is preserved:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="http://beyondloom.com/blog/dither-figures/atkinson.png">
	<figcaption>Atkinson error diffusion</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Modifying <code>floyd2()</code> above, we can simplify <code>m</code>, as all the error is propagated in an even proportion. The sliding error window <code>e</code> now needs to be roughly twice as large to account for the broader spread pattern:</p>

<pre><code>function atkinson(pixels,w) {
	const e=Array(2*w).fill(0), m=[0,1,w-2,w-1,w,2*w-1]
	return pixels.map(x =&gt; {
		const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix&gt;.5, err=(pix-col)/8
		m.forEach(x =&gt; e[x]+=err)
		return col
	})
}
</code></pre>

		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Compared side-by-side with Floyd-Steinberg dithering, Atkinson’s algorithm seems to produce richer contrast, at the cost of some detail in very light or dark areas of the image.</p>

<h2 id="ditheringinike">Dithering in iKe</h2>

<p>Readers of this blog might be curious to know what Atkinson dithering would look like in <a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/tree/gh-pages/ike">iKe</a>.</p>

<p>We can leverage iKe’s capabilities for loading remote images via the special <code>/i</code> operative. By specifying the built-in palette <code>gray</code>, the input image will be converted into a matrix of <em>[0,255]</em> grayscale values. To resize the iKe graphics window to match the image, we initialize the magic variables <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> based on the dimensions of this matrix. Our running error window is stored in a global (<code>e</code>) initialized with two rows worth of zeroes (<code>&amp;2*w</code>). The definition of our mask <code>m</code> is virtually identical to the JavaScript version above.</p>

<p>Most of the work happens in <code>d</code>, which is meant to dither one pixel. We find the value of the current pixel, incorporating accumulated error (<code>p:x+*e</code>), quantize the output color (<code>c:p&gt;.5</code>), shift out the consumed error value and shift in a zero (<code>e::1_e,0</code>), and then <em>amend</em> <code>e</code> by adding the error at the current pixel at every index in our mask <code>m</code> (<code>@[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]</code>).</p>

<p>To dither the entire image, we explicitly apply <code>d</code> to each pixel of the matrix, remembering to first rescale the input <em>[0,255]</em> palette indices into floating point <em>[0.0,1.0]</em> values. For an animated application of this code, it would be necessary to reset <code>e</code> after each frame.</p>

<pre><code>/i pixels;gray;https://i.imgur.com/Lcq4Xi4.png
w: #*pixels
h: #pixels
e: &amp;2*w
m: (0;1;w-2;w-1;w;2*w-1)
d: {p:x+*e; c:p&gt;.5; e::1_e,0; @[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]; c}
,(;;d''pixels%255)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Parental anxieties can damage kids’ relationship with food</em></p>



<p><em><sub>(The below completed story, assigned to me by <strong>Optimum Wellness</strong>, is posted here with permission from my editor. It’s been held indefinitely as Covid has affected many magazines’ page counts, but I wanted to get it out there as I really enjoyed this one!)</sub> </em></p>







<p>By Sarah Protzman Howlett</p>



<p>As parents, it can be a tall order to foster positive body image and a healthy relationship with food in our kids when both are sore subjects in our own lives. The new book&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Intuitive-Eating-Healthy/dp/1612439330">A Parent’s Guide to Intuitive Eating</a>” by pediatrician <a href="https://www.doctoryami.com/">Dr. Yami&nbsp;Cazorla-Lancaster</a> helps parents navigate these confusing waters using the principles of intuitive eating, a so-called “anti-diet” that eschews food restrictions. In the book, Dr. Yami outlines five pillars she says will help parents cultivate adventurous, joyful meal times for everyone at the table, no matter what hang-ups lurk in your past.</p>



<p><strong>Honor hunger and satiety</strong></p>



<p>Parents should decide what food to serve and when, Dr. Yami says—and then? <em>Shhhh</em>. “After you’ve presented the food, your job is done,” she says. Steer clear of any goading: <em>Come on, have another bite! Don’t you want more? You didn’t even touch your broccoli. If you want dessert, you have to eat your…</em> are all counterproductive, she says. Instead, let the child know they will never be forced to eat but that they must use manners, perhaps remaining at the table until everyone is done eating. Parents who are fearful their child is too small or too large seem to struggle most with this one, Dr. Yami says: “When a parent is anxious about a kid who is larger or more robust, or is very lean or petite, they’ll start urging a few more bites and so forth,” she says. “In other words, intervening when the child should be using their own intuition.”</p>



<p><strong>Emphasize whole-plant foods</strong></p>



<p>This phrasing intimidates many parents, Dr. Yami says, because it conjures images of salad and little else, when in reality plant-based eating is much broader. Think beyond mere leaves and create meals around the foods kids almost universally love that also happen to be plants: potatoes, corn, fruit, etc. Plant-forward meals decrease the risk of chronic disease and increase longevity, she says, and are packed with fiber and antioxidants. Avoid restrictive diets, especially ones that forbid foods widely considered healthy, she says: “The Paleo diet eliminates beans and whole grains, which are very health promoting and support the gut microbiome,” she says, “and fad diets like Keto can be incredibly dangerous for kids because of the lack of macronutrients. We can have carbs and fat as part of delicious, abundant meals.”</p>



<p><strong>Establish a positive environment</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Yami urges filling your home with health-promoting foods, making sure what’s available matches the messaging: “If you tell your kids to eat fruits and vegetables but there are chips everywhere, you’re not giving the brain and the eyes an opportunity to make those things part of kids’ consciousness,” she says. Further, examine what body-image messages your kids may be absorbing, through TV, social media and films, or hearing talk about dieting or body size—be it yours or someone else’s. “You may be telling your kids ‘all bodies are good bodies’ but have a magazine that says LOSE 10 POUNDS on the cover,” she says. “You put the culture into your child’s brain.”</p>



<p><strong>Be flexible</strong></p>



<p>Parents should feel free to honor the cultural importance of, for instance, cake at birthday parties, candy on Halloween and chocolate bunnies on Easter—again, without additional commentary that can instill guilt. “When they eat their cake, don’t give them the side eye or say something like, ‘I think you’ve had enough,’ ” she says. For older kids, Dr. Yami advises candid conversations about sugar, salt and fat—and how we as humans are naturally driven to eat those things because they taste good. For parents with younger kids, the temptation to forbid sugar can backfire once a child goes to school and sees other kids enjoying such foods in moderation. Denying access to sweets or other foods deemed “bad” can lead kids to hoard food, binge or hide candy wrappers in their pockets, she says.</p>



<div><p><strong>Relax and have fun</strong></p><p>Dr. Yami says too many parents in her practice deal with crushing guilt and shame over any number of parenting issues, but that tensions run highest where food is concerned. “Parents are so anxious, and the dinner table becomes stressful,” she says. “When it comes to food, parents do not need to be saints or be perfect. Their kid is going to be <em>fine</em>. We are not trying to feed them enough broccoli to get into Harvard.” She says that if a parent is getting whole-plant foods into their child’s diet, to not overthink the rest. Pressure and perfectionism zaps all joy from family mealtimes; she says. “Your kids love you, so give yourself space and time to try different things,” she says. “You do not have to get everything right all the time.”</p></div>



<div><p><strong>&gt;&gt; No “bad” foods</strong></p><p>In Dr. Yami’s family, no nosh is forbidden. But this cornerstone of intuitive eating—that no food is banned or off limits—doesn’t ignore the fact that some foods pack more nutrition than others. “I call them ‘health-promoting foods’ and ‘play foods,’ ” she says. “Play foods are fun but are probably more processed, and we won’t eat them all the time.” Regardless of what your kids may hear at school—that certain foods are “good” and others are “bad”—parents who reject this rigid way of thinking about food must say so, and say so often. “You can say, ‘Some foods help us feel better and have more health benefits than other foods, but nothing is off limits,’ ” she says. “That gives kids the ability to keep foods on an even platform.”</p></div>

                        <p>India <em>should</em> launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.</p><p>We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/the-indian-government-may-ban-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html">proposed ban</a>, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should <em>buy</em> Bitcoin rather than <em>ban </em>Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.</p><h2 id="1-crypto-is-now-a-trillion-dollar-industry">1. Crypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry</h2><p>Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoins-proof-of-work-the-problem-of-the-byzantine-generals-33dc4540442">unsolved problem</a> in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.</p><p>Yes, you read that right: <em>trillion</em>. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">today</a>, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png 783w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!</figcaption></figure><p>So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it's led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don't get how large the space is. Let's give some more numbers.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/what-is-ethereum">Ethereum</a>, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a></em>, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.</li><li>Ethereum has given birth to an entire sector called <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi">decentralized finance</a></em> ("defi") which is to traditional finance ("tradfi") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost <a href="https://defipulse.com/">$30B in assets</a> are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.</li><li>The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-on-pace-to-settle-over-1-trillion-in-transactions-in-2020-analyst/">&gt;$1T in volume</a> in 2020, more than PayPal.</li><li>So-called "<a href="http://stablecoinstats.com/">stablecoins</a>" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.</li><li>The website coinmarketcap.com has a higher Alexa ranking (<a href="https://archive.is/wip/OJv3Y">#324 at last check</a>) than the website wsj.com (last ranked <a href="https://archive.is/wip/tgPHo">as #440</a>). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal's official website! And that flip first occurred in <a href="https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/893557870897184768">2017</a>.</li><li>The research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=18205202439612985620&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">13,000 times</a> by professors at places like <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses/cs251-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-technologies">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/introduction-blockchain-and-bitcoin?delta=0">Harvard</a>, and <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">applied cryptography</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07091.pdf">distributed computing</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/cryptocurrency-startups">More than five billion dollars</a> in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world's top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png 860w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Annual crypto transaction volumes are now in <a href="https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1318985292347543552">excess of $1T</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here's some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/01/price-of-bitcoin-jumps-after-elon-musk-says-it-is-a-good-thing"><em>Elon Musk</em></a><em>:</em> The world's richest man has said that Bitcoin is "inevitable" and changed his Twitter bio to simply "#Bitcoin".</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1297640002604527621"><em>The IMF</em></a>: Cryptocurrency could "completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills" and "could be the next step in the evolution of money."</li><li><a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/pt/293821525702130886/pdf/Cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain.pdf"><em>The World Bank</em></a>: "Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are<br>part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized."</li><li><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-treasury-secretary-larry-summers-says-bitcoin-is-here-to-stay"><em>Larry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary</em></a>: "Bitcoin is here to stay" and the "financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin."</li></ul><p>At this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there's an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.</p><p>But it's actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn't just an economic sector, it's a <em>civilizational advance</em> on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.</p><h2 id="2-national-security-crypto-means-india-can-t-be-deplatformed">2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed</h2><p>As noted above, a <a href="https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/draft-banning-cryptocurrency-regulation-official-digital-currency-bill-2019">recent bill</a> introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India's national security. But as we'll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually <em>essential</em> to India's national security.</p><h3 id="bitcoin-prevents-financial-deplatforming">Bitcoin prevents financial deplatforming</h3><p>First, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a <em>centralized</em> currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are <em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp#:~:text=Decentralized%20currency%2C%20peer%2Dto%2D,central%20bank%2C%20like%20U.S.%20dollars.">decentralized</a></em> international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-jpm-idUSKBN29A1IF">digital gold</a>, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.</p><p>It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045">3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.</p><p>Similarly, for the same reason that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-leader-condemns-twitter-facebook-blocking-trump-75123130">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/11/problematic-twitter-merkel-france-trump/">France</a> expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347902693537239040">national replacements</a> for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.</p><p>Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/in/all/top-free/">dependent</a> on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like <a href="https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/">SWIFT</a>, PayPal, or Google Pay.</p><p>What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/amazon-viral-fire-photos-fake-misleading-leonardo-dicaprio/">fake photo</a> of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/amazon-fires-show-limits-sovereignty/596779/">invasion of Brazil</a>. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.</p><p>In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/India-permanently-bans-TikTok-and-58-other-Chinese-apps#:~:text=The%20ministry's%20June%20order%20stated,of%20state%20and%20public%20order.%22">TikTok ban</a>, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.</p><h2 id="3-foreign-investment-crypto-brings-capital-to-india">3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India</h2><p>A second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight. But the opposite is true.</p><p>After all, what do <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/elon-musk-on-clubhouse-i-am-a-supporter-of-bitcoin.html">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/">Marc Andreessen</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/09/17/billionaire-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reveals-why-bitcoin-is-the-best-internet-currency/?sh=57f875e4439e">Jack Dorsey</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/peter-thiel-is-betting-on-bitcoin-to-be-the-online-equivalent-to-gold.html">Peter Thiel</a>, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244859">Reid Hoffman</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/prominent-silicon-valley-investor-naval-doesnt-think-bitcoin-goes-to-3k-again/">Naval Ravikant</a>, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-reasons-why-chamath-loves-crypto/">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, and countless CEOs, founders, angels, and venture capitalists have in common?

It repels a trillion dollars in crypto capital from coming to India in the first place. The proposed crypto ban would <em>itself</em> cause capital flight.</p><p>And <em>capitalist</em> flight. Lest we forget, Indian entrepreneurs are highly <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/at-17-5-million-indian-diaspora-largest-in-the-world-un-report/articleshow/71179163.cms?from=mdr">mobile</a>.

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>
