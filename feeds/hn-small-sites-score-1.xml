<blockquote>
  <p>SEC Investor Education:</p>

  <p>New Year’s Financial Resolution: Avoid too-good-to-be-true “investments” with Ponzi scheme “red flag” claims like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“To the moon! To the mars!”</li>
    <li>“Number go up!”</li>
    <li>“Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!”</li>
    <li>“Could quadruple in 2021 and rally to $100,000!”</li>

</blockquote>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Some “unpopular” bitcoin facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster</li>
  <li>Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters’ Greed Fest</li>
  <li>The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!</li>
  <li>Bitcoin Is Comedy Gold - Bitcoin Is the New Standard?! - LOL</li>
  <li>When Will the Music Stop? (Hint: Try to Cash Out)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what!?  Do your own research! Here we go:</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://theirtimeline.com/1-million-sales-in-1-year-a-chronological-study-of-jack-butchers-visualize-value-part-1-the-unsung-era/">part 1</a>, we documented how Visualize Value was created as an attempt to productize the whole system of allowing businesses to better market themselves to customers. It was not a smooth sailing journey- there was no clear product until 11 months in.</p><p>In part 2, we will focus on the growth of VV's first digital product- Daily Manifest. </p><p>We will learn how Jack:</p><ol><li>more than tripled the price of his product... and continued having incredible sales,</li><li>created a community that was attuned to his creative process and eager to learn from him, and</li><li>introduced synergy among his offerings so that each offering helped to drive the sales of others.</li></ol><p>Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><p>Here are some stats from Visualize Value around the point of Daily Manifest launch (December 16 2019):</p><p>🗓 November 24 2019: Around 270 likes for a Tweet. While this is a major improvement over the initial tweets, there is nothing to suggest that Visualize Value will grow exponentially to its current scale of having a few thousand likes on each tweet.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Value.” <a href="https://t.co/dTYp5oqeU4">pic.twitter.com/dTYp5oqeU4</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1198295935580884992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It is also hard to trace the exact factors that allowed Visualize Value to gain more exposure. A possible answer, aside from the natural compounding of his content, is that Jack has been going onto other platforms to talk about Visualize Value. An example is <a href="https://www.mavenadviser.com/podcast5/jack-butcher">the interview that he did with Maven Adviser</a>, released on November 28 2019.</p><p>At this point in time, Jack probably felt comfortable enough with the quantity and quality of Visualize Value's graphics that he decided it's time to gain more exposure via guesting on other platforms.</p><p>The key lesson here (discussed in <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/173-dru-riley-of-trends-vc">Courtland Allen's interview with Dru Riley</a>):</p><ul><li>Instead of rushing for the launch (or putting our product in front of as many people as possible), it is wiser to instead put it in front of a small audience and iterate until we find a product that works. If we refer to the first tweet above, we can already see the distinctive Visualize Value design in it. Contrast this with the account's initial tweets, which had different design elements.</li></ul><h2 id="rise">Rise</h2><p>🗓 February 17 2020: 15,000 VV followers on Twitter. It took about 13 months for Jack to accumulate this audience size. Again, one of the key principles of Jack's success is leveraging on existing audiences of other individuals and adding value to those individuals. How can you do something similar for your product?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1229149748424331266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 February 25 2020: 1,000th order for Visualize Value's Daily Manifest. This is inline with the rough approximation that less than 10% of your audience will be active product buyers. For VV's case, it was around 3%.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just hit our 1,000th order. Thank you.</p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1232137721998692353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 6 2020: Build a community. Now that Jack has created a sufficient audience size on Twitter, the next step is to create an environment for your audience to interact more closely with each other and you. This community can also provide closer feedback on what they hope to get from you, and you can create products that satisfies their need.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1235688840830033924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 10 2020: $15.5k in revenue that took 14 months to grow. The first 11 months were spent iterating. Jack's ability to create bite-sized visuals (3 to 4 posts a day) allowed him to go through a huge number of iterations, thus speeding up the networking and audience building process.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It has taken me about 14 months to grow <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@visualizevalue</a> from $0 a month to $6k~ a month.</p><p>All while running an agency that is significantly more profitable, but significantly less specific, and all service based.</p><p>The product game is harder, but more satisfying. <a href="https://t.co/zepfk4Ix31">pic.twitter.com/zepfk4Ix31</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1237219734233505792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 13 2020: Expanding on the community aspect, Jack launches his first office hours. You want to iterate a new product/service among a smaller (and ideally your close) audience, before launching it to the general public. Office hours also help to create a stronger bond among his community as it is a real-time event.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1238306163843903488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 30 2020: $5k sales in 24 hours. The trick? A substantial price increase + limited time is always an amazing combination to drive sales. This is a strategy often used- selling at a cheaper price initially to validate market + collect testimonials, then raising the price.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244308058869772288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244373984474472451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Transparency time:</p><p>Results from a pre-price raise promotion:</p><p>$5k in 24 hours from a $19 product. </p><p>Thanks to all new members.</p><p>Now $57. Until it isn’t.</p><p>I’ll be breaking this all down in more detail in the VV community. </p><p>Hop in here: <a href="https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke">https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke</a> <a href="https://t.co/O1xay3CkOl">pic.twitter.com/O1xay3CkOl</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244475521292959747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 April 16 2020: The Daily Manifest made over $10k in sales. This ridiculous amount of sales of a one-page pdf is not driven by the sole prospect of daily planning; rather, the audience is also enticed by the prospect of joining a community that can teach them how to communicate better and earn more.</p><p>Jack's genius is in integrating different products and services so that there is synergy among them. What is a simple product of yours that you can add value to by integrating it with other services?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1250618935415910400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This concludes today's time capsule on Visualize Value's Daily Manifest. In future installments, we will further examine how Jack created his other products such as <em>Build Once, Sell Twice</em> and the <em>Permissionless Apprentice.</em></p><p>Subscribe to receive future issues that examine the exact path and timeline of successful entrepreneurs, and learn how you can apply those lessons to your own journey.</p><p>Give Their Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/their_timeline">a shout out on Twitter</a> if there is any entrepreneur whom you'll like to be featured too.</p><p>Keep building! 🔨</p>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

<h3>Dive into Dr Ian Harris’ research</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28592661-surgery-the-ultimate-placebo">Book</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzueFu1cq5U">Lecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HSd2K4IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Papers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253">Relevant paper</a> backing the claim that most surgeries are ineffective</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last weekend, I played in the Women Unite Over CTF, hosted by <a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">WomenHackerz</a> and several other organizations.&nbsp; There was a fantastic turnout, with 1,000 women playing!&nbsp; For many of the participants, it was their first time playing a CTF.</p><p>After the event was over, there was some discussion on what to do if you wanted to play more CTFs, if you got stumped a lot, etc.&nbsp; This is intended to be <strong>a guide for beginners who have just started playing CTFs</strong> (or for people who have never played, but would like to).</p><p>It certainly isn’t the only CTF resource out there, but I find that a lot of the resources are either big information dumps (hard to pick through as a beginner) or links without context or guidance on how to improve.&nbsp; This post seeks to change that.&nbsp; : )</p><h2 id="what-is-a-ctf">What is a CTF?</h2><p>CTF stands for “<strong>capture the flag</strong>.”&nbsp; It’s a hacking competition where the challenges (or a hacking environment, or both) are set up for you to hack.&nbsp; Once you successfully solve a challenge or hack something, you get a “flag”, which is a specially formatted piece of text.&nbsp; You can then submit that flag for points… the player or team with the most points wins!</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPcqmx1mpCOJJp6/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Each challenge is usually oriented around a single concept.&nbsp; By solving challenges, you (hopefully!) learn about a new concept, vulnerability, tool, class of attack, etc.</p><h3 id="ctf-styles">CTF Styles</h3><p>Most CTFs are “<strong>jeopardy style</strong>", meaning that there are a handful of categories, and each of the (typically standalone) challenges falls in to one of those categories.</p><p>The categories vary from CTF to CTF, but typically include:</p><ul><li><strong>RE (reverse engineering)</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and reverse engineer it to find a flag</li><li><strong>Pwn</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and a link to a program running on a remote server.&nbsp; Cause a buffer overflow, etc. to bypass normal functionality and get the program to read the flag to you.</li><li><strong>Crypto</strong>:&nbsp; crypto means cryptography!&nbsp; Get an encrypted flag and figure out how to decrypt it (includes both classical and modern ciphers)</li><li><strong>Web</strong>:&nbsp; web-based challenges where you are directed to a website, and you have to find and exploit a vulnerability (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) to get a flag.</li><li><strong>Forensics/Stego</strong>:&nbsp; given a PCAP file, image, audio or other file, find a hidden message and get the flag.</li><li><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; this is a bit of a grab bag.&nbsp; Includes random puzzles, electronics-based things, OSINT, anything that doesn’t fit into the other categories.</li></ul><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1vZaAcldbX8Xh6lMlV/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Jeopardy isn’t the only style.&nbsp; There are a few <strong>attack/defense CTFs</strong>, where you are given control of a server that you must protect from other players, while also attacking other servers.&nbsp; These are fairly rare (and pretty difficult to set up, I imagine).</p><p>There are also CTFs that emulate <strong>pen testing</strong>, where you are given a target VM (“box”) to hack into, and escalate your privileges until you are a root user.&nbsp; These are also fairly rare but a lot of fun.&nbsp; Check out <strong>Metasploitable</strong> in late November (<a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2018/11/05/announcing-the-2018-metasploit-community-ctf/">here is the announcement from 2018</a>), or <strong><a href="https://hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a></strong> year-round.</p><h2 id="logistics-and-how-to-find-ctfs">Logistics and How to Find CTFs</h2><h3 id="wait-before-you-go-any-further">Wait!&nbsp; Before you go any further</h3><p>It’s definitely more fun to play with friends, or even internet strangers.&nbsp; Playing with other people means that you can get each other unstuck, and you can also support each other when you make progress, get a new tool working, or find a flag… or when you don’t.&nbsp; Especially when you’re new, CTFs can feel like repeatedly banging your head against the wall (there’s so much to learn in this field!).&nbsp; Having others to play alongside can definitely help lift that emotional burden when things aren’t going well, and give you people to celebrate with when you make a breakthrough.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/haBeggedmenEA/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>You might think, “who am I going to convince to play CTFs” with me?&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many online groups that are open to beginners.&nbsp; A short list includes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opentoallctf.github.io/">OpenToAll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">Women Hackers</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1068173165610831872">CTF Circle</a></li></ul><p>You can try Slack/Discord for local security meet-up groups to see if there’s any interest in teaming up.&nbsp; Same goes for university groups, if you’re a student.&nbsp; Finally, you can also check Slack or Discord for a given CTF, as often there are other people looking for teammates.</p><p>Even if your first response to this idea is “oh hell no”, give it try, at least once.&nbsp; : )</p><h3 id="where-to-find-ctfs">Where to find CTFs</h3><p>There are <strong>in-person CTFs</strong> (especially if you live on the east or west coast in the US) throughout the year, plus many at <strong>conferences</strong>.</p><p>But there are also plenty of <strong>online CTFs</strong>, which is what I mostly play.&nbsp; They typically happen on weekends, and run for 1-3 days, although some go for a week or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;To find them, check out <a href="https://ctftime.org/"><strong>CTFTime</strong></a> and click on “Upcoming”.&nbsp; This is continually updated (and sometimes at the last minute).&nbsp; Also keep an eye out on Twitter.</p><p>A few CTFs and CTF platforms are <strong>available online, year round</strong>.&nbsp; See the bottom of this post (“Bonus Round!") for more.</p><h2 id="and-now-for-the-resource-list">And now for the resource list!</h2><p>There’s really no substitute for actually doing CTF challenges, even if you only make a little bit of progress.&nbsp; This resource list has a few goals:</p><ul><li>Equip you with enough tools and knowledge to get started on a CTF challenge in a given category</li><li>Point you towards additional resources if you want to build up your skills outside of time-limited CTF events, and alert you to any category-specific sites or platforms</li><li>Give you a basic list of things to try if you have no idea where to start with a challenge</li></ul><p>There’s a LOT to learn.&nbsp; If you’re new, I recommend that you <strong>find a few beginner CTFs that are “jeopardy” style, and try a few challenges from each category and see what you enjoy doing</strong>.&nbsp; If you like doing one category, that’s great!&nbsp; It’s also great if you like to do a bit of everything.&nbsp; My top recommendation for a “jeopardy”-style beginner CTF is <strong><a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a></strong>, but there are more options in the “Bonus Round!” section at the bottom of this post.</p><p>This guide is by no means comprehensive.&nbsp; I know there are a ton of sites and resources out there.&nbsp; I wanted to share my top picks for each category, with options for different learning styles.</p><h2 id="re">RE</h2><p>Reverse engineering (RE), involves taking a binary and, well, reverse engineering it to determine its functionality (and find a flag).</p><p>In industry, RE skills are used for vulnerability research.&nbsp; You might be given a software program and asked to find vulnerabilities (without having source code).&nbsp; Similarly, malware research involves a lot of reverse engineering.&nbsp; In my view, it’s a bit more niche than its inclusion in CTFs would lead you to believe, but still a challenging/fun category.</p><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/4UzW8S83pWoKs/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><h3 id="resources-to-get-started">Resources to get started</h3><p>It can be pretty daunting to get started in reverse engineering, especially if you have little or no experience in low-level programming languages like assembly.&nbsp; As you get started, try to find something in the code to orient yourself… a call to a standard library function (read, scanf, printf, etc.), comments, strings, etc.&nbsp; Then keep expanding and iterating from there.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>:&nbsp; My top recommendation is <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; It’s a game where you try to reverse engineer (fictitious) bluetooth locks of increasing difficulty.&nbsp; It’s all in-browser (which means no tool setup), and has a tutorial level that introduces you some of the assembly and environment.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/category/microcorruption/">write-ups for each level</a> if you get stuck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by reading</strong>:&nbsp; I’m going to double dip between this section and Pwn.&nbsp; I’d suggest <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></strong> and then <strong><a href="https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/">Practical Binary Analysis</a></strong>.&nbsp; Hacking: The Art of Exploitation takes you from a very basic level through C, assembly, program memory, exploits, and much more.&nbsp; It’s incredibly thorough and definitely worth a read</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by watching</strong>:&nbsp; Live Overflow has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN"><strong>series on binary exploitation</strong></a>.&nbsp; Check out the playlist of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="re-focused-ctfs">RE-focused CTFs:</h3><p>I’m going to suggest <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong> one more time.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; There’s also FireEye’s yearly <strong><a href="http://flare-on.com/">Flare-On</a></strong> challenge, which will probably kick your ass (it always kicks mine) but it’s worth a try.</p><p>You can also find plenty of RE challenges in jeopardy-style events, both year-round and regular/short-term CTFs.</p><h3 id="tools-and-other-resources">Tools and other resources</h3><p>You will definitely need special tools to do RE challenges.&nbsp; There are lots of tools to choose from, as well as different categories of tools (disassembler, decompiler, debugger, etc.).&nbsp; In addition to having varying functionality, different tools are needed for different file types.</p><p>If you are a total beginner, I’ll once again recommend <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; A lot of the tools listed below can be difficult to set up, and in the interest of removing barriers to entry, I’m suggesting Microcorruption as an introduction to RE, because you don’t have to install anything to get started.</p><p>Eventually though, you’ll want to install and get familiar with different tools:</p><ul><li>My favorite is <strong><a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a></strong> and have done some previous write-ups using it.&nbsp; I like the UI/UX and the available features.&nbsp; The only downside is that you need a license (I got mine originally through a BSides RE workshop, otherwise it’s $149).</li><li>There are plenty of free options as well.&nbsp; My second choice is <strong><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a></strong>, which is free and fairly beginner friendly.&nbsp; There’s also <strong><a href="https://www.radare.org/r/">Radare</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">Ollydb</a></strong>, <strong>gdb</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">IDAPro</a></strong>, <strong>Objdump</strong> and many more.</li></ul><p>Similar to “try a bunch of categories and see what you prefer”, I recommend trying a bunch of tools and see what you prefer.&nbsp; I realize that installing a bunch of tools can be a gigantic pain in the ass, so here are a couple VM options that get you a bunch of pre-installed tools:</p><ul><li><strong>FireEye</strong> provides a VM image as part of their Flare-On competition (<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/07/flare-vm-the-windows-malware.html">see this link for more info</a>) that includes many pre-installed RE tools.</li><li>You can also install a <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali</a> VM</strong>, which comes pre-installed with various tools as well.</li></ul><p>As for more resources, <strong>OpenToAll</strong> has a <a href="https://github.com/OpenToAllCTF/REsources">fantastic list of RE Resources here</a>.&nbsp; This includes some foundational knowledge like C, x86 assembly, and more.</p><p>There’s also this free <strong><a href="https://www.begin.re/">beginner RE workshop</a></strong> that uses IDA.</p><p><strong>If you have no idea where to start with an RE challenge</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>does <code>strings &lt;filename&gt;</code> reveal find any interesting strings in the program?&nbsp;
Open the file in a debugger/disassembler/decompiler tool (as listed above) and try to get a sense of what the program does.&nbsp; Are there any ASCII-range characters?&nbsp;</li><li>What user …</li></ul></div></div>

</ul>
<p>Recently I discovered a nice way to capture call stack in Haskell exceptions almost transparently, and I’m going to share it in this post</p>
<p>If this is a known technique, let me know, otherwise — enjoy using it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-call-stack">What is a call stack</h2>
<p>Suppose somewhere in the program you use <code>error</code> to signal an impossible situation:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>foo ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>bar ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then accidentally use it with an empty list:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously, there is an error, but <code>GHCI</code> also prints a peculiar thing: a call stack! It contains only one entry and isn’t helpful, though… So you go to <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/">GHC manual</a> to see what <code>HasCallStack</code> the message is talking about, and there it is: <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#hascallstack"><code>HasCallStack</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>As the manual says, you add <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint to your <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-4"></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now the output becomes much more informative:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>10</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get function names, module names and even source locations for all calls starting from the <code>ghci</code> prompt down to the point where <code>error</code> is called.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that stack is captured only as far from the <code>error</code> call as there are <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint. E.g., dropping the constraint from <code>foo</code> will also exclude <code>bar</code> from the log:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Still, you get to know the precise location of the <code>error</code> call, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>read</code> and so on use <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Err.html#v:errorWithoutStackTrace"><code>errorWithoutStackTrace</code></a> (for performance reasons), so you won’t ever see stack traces from them. One more reason to avoid <code>head</code>!</p>
<h2 id="using-exceptions">Using exceptions</h2>
<p>However, using <code>error</code> to report errors is not very convenient: you can pass only a <code>String</code> as an argument and so catching specific errors while propagating others becomes very hard and messy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another mechanism in GHC for that: exceptions. So you define your custom exception type and throw it from the <code>foo</code> function like this:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>, <span>Exception</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-5">foo [] <span>=</span> throw <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-7"></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You run it and expect to see the nice exception with a stack trace. But…</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get none! What is going on, and how <code>error</code> is different from <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Exception.html#v:throw"><code>throw</code></a>?</p>
<p>The reason is that exceptions don’t capture the stack trace automatically, even when thrown from a place with <code>HasCallStack</code> context. There is an <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12096">open issue</a> to do so, reported back in 2016, but no progress was made yet.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-stacks">Capturing stacks</h2>
<p>But what if we want to capture stack with exceptions? One possible way would be to save the stack (represented as <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Stack.html#t:CallStack"><code>CallStack</code></a> type) as part of the exception constructor, then make your custom <code>throwWithStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; Foo -&gt; IO ()</code> function and use it everywhere, but that is too cumbersome, and you may just forget to use the right throwing function.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a better way. Recall that magic <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint captures call stack from the point where something annotated with it is used. We don’t want to annotate <code>throw</code>, but there is one more thing on the same line — exception constructor itself! It turns out, you can use GADTs to capture stack with an exception data:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">  <span>FooException</span><span> ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then access it in <code>Show</code> instance:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">  <span>show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>"FooException\n"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> prettyCallStack callStack</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>deriving</span> anyclass <span>instance</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-- alternatively, derive Show from stock and print call stack in 'displayException' method.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>callStack</code> is provided by <code>GHC.Stack</code> and will use <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint introduced by pattern match on <code>FooException</code> GADT constructor.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of how it works:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4">  <span>FooException</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>16</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>7</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For another example, here is a real call stack I reproduced in our production code:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>Operation</span> timeout</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>TimeOut</span>, called at src<span>/</span><span>Database</span><span>/</span><span>Bolt</span><span>/</span>Connection.hs<span>:</span><span>38</span><span>:</span><span>36</span> <span>in</span> hasbolt<span>-</span><span>0.1</span><span>.</span><span>4.3</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>Database.Bolt.Connection</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">  run, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>43</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5">  runDB, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>124</span><span>:</span><span>14</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">  programs, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>API</span><span>/</span>Program.hs<span>:</span><span>33</span><span>:</span><span>17</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.API.Program</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p><code>HasCallStack</code> is a magic constraint, so the fact that this trick works may or may not be a coincidence: some later change in GHC may stop GADT pattern match from affecting how <code>HasCallStack</code> is solved. However, I think that this approach is useful enough and may be used in practice. Just don’t forget to add enough <code>HasCallStack</code> to places which can fail.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, though, that <code>HasCallStack</code> is not free and sometimes can break some optimizations, especially if used in recursive functions (that’s the reason <code>head</code> &amp; friends do not capture the stack).</p>
<p>Of course, this post does nothing to help debugging standard exceptions, like <code>IOError</code>. For that, the usual way is to build with <code>-prof</code> and run your code with <code>+RTS -xc</code>, as documented in <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#rts-flag--xc">the manual</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Appendix</strong>: Common misunderstandings regarding nuclear</p>



<h2>1. Can we achieve our climate goals without nuclear energy?</h2>



<p>Looking at global energy consumption, the situation seems bleak. Over 80% of global consumption still comes from fossil fuels. Consequently, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/download/#full">the IPCC report notes</a> that, above all, the capacity of low-emission renewables – wind, solar and geothermal energy – must be multiplied in order to combat climate change. Additionally, IPCC report scenarios for 1.5 degrees warming require a two to sixfold increase for nuclear power.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Mwc7IATWBVsl4dcDZ5OBNl7wR68n8WcKaCC359ZMBsdYfM_JT1NlDgHOXEJNE7p8p6Z-EwSw_pEkH4pEZ17DSazKelHzu1uNkRx_ts2ollYmNBUUed8-dNyXehFZh5RXu7OpZ_vU" alt=""></figure>

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kUXqwLAM04PQzFDYyXXi1AcDVB86AF153eD_gQP8NOpuQaHiqQWRHaBy6PFjokDQNyNJE_ZwPbEfGh6fNo1RUzeYz1U5KV3d5wMMlCs2-DOGMN_UozX_SStEvC33ESHAi2FScg0Z" alt=""></figure>



<p>Traditionally, opposing nuclear power is associated with trust in a notion, created in the media and in public discourses, that a problem-free renewable-energy based solution is waiting for us just around the corner, and that this solution will cover all future energy needs. For example, with news about how Denmark has been run entirely by renewable energy for a day, an image is created that soon the same solution will work everywhere. At the same time, the media overlooks the fact that this is about electricity consumption; the total energy consumption by Denmark is still largely based on fossil fuels. Even though low-emission renewables are likely to be the most significant future energy form, renewables alone may not be able to replace all fossil energy forms in, for example, heating or increasing electrification. Wind and solar energy have challenges related to the variability of the energy production and they often need support from other energy sources. Therefore, it is worth keeping various nuclear-power based solutions as part of the energy mix.</p>



<p>The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) predicts that, <a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Apr/Global-Energy-Transition-A-Roadmap-to-2050">in 2050, renewables could produce two thirds of all energy needed</a>. When realized, this would be a great achievement! However, also the last third of the energy required in 2050 must be produced by low-emission means and not by fossil energy sources. Additionally, the report by IRENA, unfortunately, estimates that heating would largely be based on bioenergy. This is not a sustainable solution. Bioenergy cannot be sustainably increased by much, as forests must be kept as carbon storage, and be partly utilized as higher-value products, such as in wood construction. Also, human action – farming and gathering of nature’s biomass production for human use – is already driving a rapid loss of biodiversity and shrinking of species populations. When the challenge is as enormous as it is, low-emission renewables and nuclear power should not be pitted against each other. Such juxtaposition only benefits the fossil industry.</p>



<h2>2. Is nuclear power sustainable?</h2>



<p>To stop climate change, it is essential to minimize the carbon emissions from energy production. The picture below shows that nuclear power has one of the smallest carbon footprints of all electricity sources per unit of energy produced.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Vw7bDJAtG-CPOkk9wUp3Nl8KVsBGuGsQndXSSufd56MXm737dyy_yS3jyXgE8AuA94qYg0hRNnE1Oem_DfFlHXorkJmthDqiDiomw4pb4WM5kcnfDiiRZeTsztP7Z8mEDqWNfYxu" alt=""></figure>



<p><em>Median values for lifecycle emissions of different electricity sources: IPCC 2014</em></p>



<p>Some criticize nuclear power for the problems related to mining uranium. However, this kind of criticism makes one wonder what the better option would be, as all sources of energy have their own problems related to the required minerals. Renewable sources of energy require more different metals per unit of energy than nuclear power does. Nonetheless, in order to replace fossil fuels, we will need many times more low-emission renewables than we currently have.</p>



<p>The image below indicates the land use footprint of nuclear power and wind power based on actual projects. The nuclear footprint is likely overestimated, since the uranium mine depicted here produces more than three times what is used by the nuclear power plant, and the site can accommodate at least a fourth large reactor. The footprint of wind power is underestimated, as the mines and backup power needed by wind power are not included.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7jZAQK6TNHxqfFNQ7Rt7fZfbGWFen1z7pWS6AUD7mMJWZhh1IEn41Om0fdn0Qxq7kdW4BHemoimSteE1HRzOpcseSd_R54F1ucF0J8MtL-dHXjSQIdTdZ5fpSpRFWRhOiwfV7Scx" alt="" width="821" height="634"><figcaption>Data for wind park is from Environmental Impact Assessment of Oosinkangas wind park, data for nuclear is from google maps.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>3. Is nuclear power safe?</h2>



<p>Many of those opposing nuclear power originally formed their position as a reaction against the indifference towards risks in the Soviet Union, and in particular, against the resulting Chernobyl accident. This is understandable. However, there have been no accidents in plants constructed after 1980, and statistically speaking, nuclear power is actually <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy">the safest form of energy</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pNxE_sClx7Q_dd_65EC4vmiZCXeMBZcR9B_Ko_9CUgep3aHF7brgKNM-xQmdg6ykpTKyefUUQrY9R5S5-XxRRh8WZe-MrnnCHcLSqOwaXB8K4Fy4vYu42TaQG3fw7BCWmtSLdezQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Nuclear power has also been opposed due to fears of nuclear arms proliferation. However, if a country wants to make nuclear weapons, it can make them also without civilian nuclear reactors.&nbsp; Using modern nuclear reactors to make weapons material (plutonium), is actually multiple times more expensive, and easier to detect than other options, such as enriching uranium with centrifuges (e.g. Iran) to weapons grade or using a simple graphite pile to make plutonium (examples in and after Second World War). IAEA supervises the use of nuclear power and the use and transport of nuclear materials to prevent nuclear arms proliferation. Here, a strong global civilian nuclear community is a great asset.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>4. How harmful is nuclear waste?</h2>



<p>Spent nuclear fuel is also a common safety concern. However, nuclear waste management is already heavily regulated by the laws and procedures both in the EU and in the member states. In practice, spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone, anywhere. Spent nuclear fuel emits radiation and must be kept separate from the biosphere. This is not very hard: a few meters of water or concrete is adequate to stop the radiation.&nbsp; In the long term, it is preferable (safer, cheaper) to store the spent fuel for example in deep geological storage, or use it to make new nuclear fuel and low carbon energy in breeder-reactors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The graph below shows the average radioactive doses humans get, by source (Data: United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, 2008. <a href="https://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Report_Vol.I.pdf"><em>https://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Report_Vol.I.pdf</em></a>). As can be seen, the nuclear fuel cycle, which includes spent fuel, is barely the size of a rounding error. </p>



<p><img width="587" height="432" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/elCKjgL1BvrGdfke6Eeb9pvVsa0z25ibYbr-o7_QnjomNagxufXXiufj4EIduJBwUX4Bvic77Y-TcbUNecvqVkzJnmPUCF7IYznBPlHrzRUitJajkcgi0Z3I69TNN5XOEsNn6Iq1"></p>



<p>Finland’s spent nuclear fuel repository <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository">Onkalo</a> sets an example for the final disposal of nuclear waste. The independent nuclear and radiation regulator STUK has stated that the repository can be built to be passively safe. The margin of safety is such that even the purely academic modeling exercise, where everything goes wrong, the maximum doses someone might get, at 0.00018 mSv, are in the neighbourhood of a million times too small to cause any significant harm to the local population ten thousand years into the future.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>5. Is nuclear power too slow to build?</h2>



<p>Some argue that nuclear reactors are too slow to manufacture compared to the immediacy of the climate crisis. The reactors take multiple years to plan and build. However, the EU is likely still many years or decades away from ending emissions from its energy production – and even then, the energy production infrastructure needs constant rebuilding. Therefore, the nuclear reactors that start to generate power years or decades from now will help in reducing the remaining emissions. If nuclear energy is not an available tool to reduce emissions, then reaching carbon neutrality might take longer, as we argue in the next section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the reactor production is not always as slow as some of the worst recent examples indicate. According to<a href="https://pris.iaea.org/pris/"> IAEA’s PRIS database</a>, the plants built during 1990s and 2000s took less than six years to build on average, and currently the average building speed in China is around 5-6 years. The recent delays in western nuclear projects are largely due to lost expertise and supply chains during the 30 years of not building nuclear and building new First-Of-A-Kind plants that had unfinished designs when construction started. These can all be mitigated, leading to faster projects that stay on budget better.</p>







<h2>6. Is nuclear power too expensive?</h2>



<p>Some 10-20 years ago, wind and solar were very expensive. Since then, we have had extremely supportive policies and poured billions of euros in subsidies and tax-breaks for wind and solar. They have proliferated, and they have become cheaper. As can be expected, humans get better and more efficient in the things they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be observed in nuclear power as well. Several decades of not building nuclear in Europe led to prohibitively expensive “First-of-A-Kind” projects, plagued with delays and problems. Yet elsewhere, the rest of the world (ROW)&nbsp; kept on building nuclear, and can do it at low cost, relatively on time and on budget. This can be seen in the image below, taken from the recent global study “Nuclear Cost Drivers Project” done for the Energy Technologies Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it is abundantly clear that we need much more nuclear power to mitigate climate change effectively and within the required timeframe, it would make sense to make building it cheaper. Having a program to build nuclear, instead of politically risky one-off projects every decade or so, can substantially bring down nuclear energy’s costs, halving them or even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nuclear plants are big and time-consuming project even when they are successful. Therefore, the cost of capital also plays a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career, I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. with seemingly a singular heartwarming goal - to put a smile on my face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own! Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks.</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>Capitalist hegemony has short-circuited people into buying wildly illogical and ridiculous propaganda like: “<em>Lift yourselves up by the bootstraps</em>” (which shows the almost religious power of capitalist propaganda, that the impossible can become possible), or “<em>Communism doesn’t work</em>”, when in fact <strong>Communism did work extremely well.</strong></p>

The mass housing projects began in the 60s, they were completed in the 70s, and by the 70s, there were homeless people, but they often had genuine issues with mental health.</li>

<p>When it is claimed that a system <em>works</em>, we should ask, <strong>who it works for</strong>. Capitalism benefits a tiny number of rapacious capitalists, to the detriment of the rest of us, while Socialism works for the masses.</p>

<p>I’m trying to convince friends and family to switch to Signal. Opened the Signal App after several months today and I was welcomed with 100+ unread “X just joined Signal” messages. And it irritated me right away! Not for some privacy concern but because looking at 100+ automated, unread messages is simply unpleasant. So many email apps base their whole business plan around the ‘zero inbox’ idea. Instead here I was on Signal, greeted with unnecessary messages. You don’t expect me to click each one to mark as read! Or go look for solutions to bulk-delete or mark-all-read right after I signup. The two friends that I had chatted with long back were embedded deep into the sea of these messages.</p>
<p>I go back and forth between whether first impressions are as important — but dare I say, for Web and Mobile Apps they are.</p>
<p><strong>Signal ought to act confidently about its presence in the messaging Apps domain now and not act as a newbie in the market.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.: There’s an option under settings to Switch Off the “Contact Joined Signal” notifications. This should be default off or completely removed from the App.)</p>

            <p><em><strong>Cash and Stock Transaction Valued at Approximately $8.0 Billion</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Teledyne and FLIR to Host Joint Conference Call and Webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Today</em></p>
<p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and ARLINGTON, Va. – January 4, 2021 – Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) (“Teledyne”) and FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR) (“FLIR”) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Teledyne will acquire FLIR in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $8.0 billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, FLIR stockholders will receive $28.00 per share in cash and 0.0718 shares of Teledyne common stock for each FLIR share, which implies a total purchase price of $56.00 per FLIR share based on Teledyne’s 5-day volume weighted average price as of December 31, 2020. &nbsp;The transaction reflects a 40% premium for FLIR stockholders based on FLIR’s 30-day volume weighted average price as of December 31, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Teledyne has arranged a $4.5 billion 364-day credit commitment to fund the transaction and refinance certain existing debt.&nbsp; Teledyne expects to fund the transaction with permanent financing prior to closing.&nbsp; Net leverage at closing is expected to be approximately 4.0x adjusted pro forma EBITDA with leverage declining to less than 3.0x by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Teledyne expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings, excluding transaction costs and intangible asset amortization, and accretive to GAAP earnings in the first full calendar year following the acquisition.</p>
<p>“At the core of both our companies is proprietary sensor technologies. &nbsp;Our business models are also similar: we each provide sensors, cameras and sensor systems to our customers. &nbsp;However, our technologies and products are uniquely complementary with minimal overlap, having imaging sensors based on different semiconductor technologies for different wavelengths,” said Robert Mehrabian, Executive Chairman of Teledyne. &nbsp;“For two decades, Teledyne has demonstrated its ability to compound earnings and cash flow consistently and predictably. &nbsp;Together with FLIR and an optimized capital structure, I am confident we shall continue delivering superior returns to our stockholders.”</p>
<p>“FLIR’s commitment to innovation spanning multiple sensing technologies has allowed our company to grow into the multi-billion-dollar company it is today,” said Earl Lewis, Chairman of FLIR. &nbsp;“With our new partner’s platform of complementary technologies, we will be able to continue this trajectory, providing our employees, customers and stockholders even more exciting momentum for growth. &nbsp;Our Board fully supports this transaction, which delivers immediate value and the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company.”</p>
<p>Jim Cannon, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR, said, “We could not be more excited to join forces with Teledyne through this value-creating transaction. &nbsp;Together, we will offer a uniquely complementary end-to-end portfolio of sensory technologies for all key domains and applications across a well-balanced, global customer base. &nbsp;We are pleased to be partnering with an organization that shares our focus on continuous innovation and operational excellence, and we look forward to working closely with the Teledyne team as we bring our two companies together to capitalize on the important opportunities ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Quarter Financial Results</strong></p>
<p>In a separate press release issued today, Teledyne announced improved preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. &nbsp;The Teledyne press release is available on www.teledyne.com. &nbsp;FLIR noted today that it expects to meet or exceed the full year fiscal 2020 guidance it provided on October 30, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Approvals and Timing </strong></p>
<p>The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in the middle of 2021 subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, approvals of Teledyne and FLIR stockholders and other customary closing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Advisors </strong></p>
<p>Evercore is acting as exclusive financial advisor and McGuireWoods LLP is acting as legal advisor to Teledyne in connection with the transaction.&nbsp; Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Hogan Lovells US LLP is acting as legal advisor to FLIR in connection with the transaction. &nbsp;Teledyne has entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility credit agreement with Bank of America as sole lead arranger and administrative agent.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast </strong></p>

                    <p>Jack Ma and Jack Dorsey, two of the leading tech entrepreneurs for their respective nations, are currently perfect juxtapositions for how <strong>different their respective countries’ systems are in managing the power of tech giants and digital information infrastructure.</strong></p><p>In October 2020, Jack Ma, China’s wealthiest man and the model idol of China Inc., was preparing to float Ant Group, in what was billed to be the largest IPO in the world. There were signs that the Chinese government was already looking to reign in some of the Chinese Tech Giant’s influence. On October 24, Ma made a rather controversial speech at a gathering of political heavyweights at the Bund Summit in Shanghai. The next day, <strong>Ma disappeared</strong> from public sightings and Ant’s IPO was halted on November 3, two days before it was supposed <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/government-versus-big-tech/">to go live</a>.</p><p>In parallel timing across the Pacific, Jack Dorsey alongside the CEOs of the other Big Tech firms, were subjected to Section 230 Congressional hearings. There, the Democrats focused on how Big Tech was failing to deal with misinformation and the extremism happening on social media networks. The Republicans focused on the issues of censorship. Both political sides made little actual progress on meaningfully reigning in Big Tech however. On the 8th of January, <strong>President Trump was suspended </strong>from Twitter and any accounts he made to get around it, were also suspended.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="spanstylecolorcc6601thecompaniesthatthejacksbuiltspan"><span>🃋 The Companies That The Jacks Built</span></h2>

During and before this period, China was becoming more open to access by foreigners. As an English teacher by training, Jack Ma was fortunate to work in a tour guide position that enabled him to interact with Western foreigners. His tours allowed him to meet two such foreigners that changed his life and later Alibaba’s trajectory.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/how-a-visit-to-australia-helped-jack-ma-become-an-internet-tycoon">first</a> was his friendship with Australian electrical engineer, Ken Morley. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/09/30/how-jerry-yang-made-the-most-lucrative-bet-in-tech-history/">second</a> was with Yahoo founder, Jerry Yang. The blossoming friendship resulted in Morley sponsoring Ma on his first ever overseas trip, to Newcastle in Australia.</p><p>According to Ma, the trip “<em>totally changed</em>” his future and instilled him with an appreciation for how Western market economics worked. The experiences shaped his later exposure to the differences in the U.S. economy to the Chinese one, and how the opportunities for the Chinese Internet economy.</p><p>Alongside the opportunistic timing of China’s market reforms, Jack Ma also met a fantastic operator in the form of American educated, Taiwanese financier, Joseph Tsai. Much of Alibaba’s financial and legal structure, it’s international dealings, were created by Tsai. As Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Tsai streamlined Alibaba’s operations. Under his instruction, he created operational standardisation and facilitated critical international investments to Alibaba’s growth and strategic acquisitions.</p><h3 id="dorsey-">Dorsey:</h3><p>Born in 1976, St Louis, Missouri, Jack Dorsey lived in the country with the highest proliferation of computers in the golden era of Commodore computers. The 1981 release of the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/desktops/76735/the-golden-age-of-commodore-computers">Commodore VIC-20</a> marked the beginning of low-cost home computers. The $299.95 launch was attractive for many home users by its inclusion of BASIC, Atari 2600 compatible controller ports, and color graphics that suited themselves well to video games. The period of cheaper computing and emergence of high school computer clubs, provided an opportunity for Dorsey to study and play around with IBM Computers.</p><p>Dorsey’s interest in computing and programming would see him drop out of University and move to California to work as a programmer. Whilst there, he was inspired by LiveJournal and AOL for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service. When he saw the implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey began to wonder whether he could use instant messaging as a status output to be easily shared among friends.</p><p>In 2000, Dorsey built a simple prototype that let him update his friends on his life via BlackBerry and email messaging. The idea didn’t seem to be too popular, so Dorsey began freelancing and also went to work for podcasting startup Odeo. There, he met his Twitter co-founders, Biz Stone and Evan Williams. In 2006, the three would build the Twitter prototype. Evan would <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6505/the-march-of-twitter-analysis-of-how-and-where-twitter-spread.aspx">blog about it</a>, others who used to work with him at Google would follow suit, and Twitter would become a viral product after becoming popular among attendees of the South by Southwest convention in Austin in March 2007, where Twitter usage would exceed more than 60,000 Tweets per day.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="spanstylecolorcc6601theamericandreamvsthechinesedreamspan"><span>🃋 The American Dream Vs The Chinese Dream </span></h2>

As the country with the longest continuous history in the world, China has not forgotten its long standing history of geopolitical greatness and the <a href="https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2019/07/11/how-the-century-of-humiliation-influences-chinas-ambitions-today/">Century of Humiliation</a> by the Western powers and Japan. This Dream has fluctuated alongside the political conveniences of the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the more laissez-faire attitude of the 1990s.</p><p>The two differing dreams have greatly influenced the narrative and general population sentiment on how each country’s system should be run. In the U.S, there has been a general lack of Government appetite or unwillingness to reign in private corporate power. The rise of a <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/rise-liberaltarian">Liberaltarian class</a> has not been favourable to an <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality">income and wealth divide</a> for the traditional working class. China in contrast is ruled by a Party that espouses a narrative for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-020-09695-3">Authoritarian order</a>, pointing to periods of great dynasties with a ruling Mandate, lest it falls to the periods of chaos when such dynasties fell apart.</p><p><strong>“<em>It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white. So long as it catches mice</em>” - Deng Xiaoping</strong></p><p>The two different dreams posit different outcomes.</p><p>In the U.S., Jack Dorsey is able to boot off the U.S. President from its platform with little to no pushback. Thierry Breton, the European Union’s Digital Commissioner, notes this as a “<em>9/11 moment of social media</em>”. In an opinion piece, he <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/thierry-breton-social-media-capitol-hill-riot/">writes</a> that the “<em>fact that a CEO can pull the plug on POTUS’s loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing. It is not only confirmation of the power of these platforms, but it also displays deep weaknesses in the way our society is organized in the digital space</em>”.</p><p>In China, even the wealthiest man and most well known Chinese ‘model’ entrepreneur can be removed (i.e. ‘step down’ as executive chairman). The Antitrust laws can be very quickly <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/draft-revisions-of-the-anti-monopoly-law-public-comment-draft/">redrafted</a> and the very biggest Tech companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals">fined</a>.</p><p>Both countries have Tech Giants who are monopolistic in behaviour. In the U.S., allegations range from collusion in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/01/16/377614477/tech-giants-will-pay-415-million-to-settle-employees-lawsuit">employee wages</a> to “copy, acquire, kill” <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21505027/congress-big-tech-antitrust-report-facebook-google-amazon-apple-mark-zuckerberg-jeff-bezos-tim-cook">strategies</a>. In China, among all 124 unicorns - private companies with a valuation of $1 Billion USD - 50.8% are controlled or owned by the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154437/true-dominance-chinas-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-revealed-and-how">BAT</a>: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p>As 2021 plays out, we may start to <strong>see more signs as to how regulation will form for the management of digital information</strong>. In China, it is clear that the CCP views its control over currency and financial flows as critical to its hold over the country’s political economy. Regulation will be implemented on any financial challenger of the CCP’s ‘bank’ status. In the US, it is uncertain how the new Biden administration will manage oversized corporate interests.</p>

      <p>If you've been following me awhile, you know that I was <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">hired by AppFolio</a> years ago to measure Ruby 3's performance, especially on Rails. This has been a long trip. And that very first project is finally over: Ruby 3 exists and I can check its final, released Rails performance.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>have</em></strong> been following along, the numbers in this post won't surprise you. But it's important to do the final measurement. If you haven't been following, this will bring you up to date.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>What Am I Measuring?</h2>

<p>In concept, I'm measuring "how fast is Ruby 3 versus Ruby 2.6 or 2.7 for a typical real-world Rails workload?"</p>

<p>"Typical real-world workload" is a vague, hand-wavy concept. But there are a lot of specifics that can back it up. I used <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2018/4/2/rails-ruby-bench-what-and-why">Rails Ruby Bench</a>, something I've written for this purpose and used for years now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">Rails Ruby Bench</a> runs a copy of <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a>, a common and popular Rails app to host internet forums. It's one of the biggest available "real" open-source Rails apps, making it a fine choice for "real world" benchmarking. RRB runs a set of simulated pseudorandom user requests against the running Rails app, and times how long they all take to finish. So it's a throughput test. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/11/28/how-do-i-use-rails-ruby-bench">You can run it yourself if you like</a>, though it's a bit complex and finicky. The dark side of using real-world software is hitting real-world complexity and bugs.</p>

<p>The Ruby versions I measured were my hacked Ruby 3.0 versus 2.6.6 and 2.7.1.</p>

<p>RRB has run against AWS m4.2xlarge instances for nearly its whole existence. That's what I'm doing again. For now: m4.2xlarge instances, 10 processes, 6 threads/process, the same as I've been <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/codefolio.html">using for over 3 years</a> for this purpose. With this post, it has fulfilled its purpose: to measure the total speedup from 2.0 to 3.0 of a typical real-world Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>And I can finally stop supporting some hideous old hacks to make that possible.</p>

<p>These results are running 90 batches per Ruby version of 15,000 requests each. That's enough to get pretty solid results, but not to detect the tiniest differences. If you need to detect the tiniest differences in speed, you should probably be analysing your own workload more carefully instead. Anything below about half a percent in speed is going to be dwarfed by differences for your own specific operations. It kinda breaks the abstraction of asking "how fast is Ruby 2.X?" — at some point you don't care about the language generally, you care about the parts of it that you specifically use a lot.</p>

<h2>Methodology and Extra Pitfalls</h2>

<p>This post <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">clearly follows the methodology of my 3.0.0-preview1 review</a>, of course. The main difference is that the Ruby branch was updated to the final release of 3.0.</p>

<p>Since I'm benchmarking with very old code for compatibility reasons, I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/tree/new_fake_2_8">a fake branch of Ruby 3</a> that doesn't remove some of the deprecated features and reports its version number as 2.8 instead of 3.0. The branch includes all the new Ruby 3 code except for <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/commit/17f4f604254b50cdc2c43eb8264f8cbf42c4ce59">a recently-added per-thread deadlock detection feature</a> that replaced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> I still needed for a deprecated feature. The per-thread deadlock detection feature isn't be used in my benchmark, especially because it didn't exist until after Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Here are those reverted features:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/ruby_30_deprec.png" alt="A variety of Ruby 3.0.0 deprecations-turned-errors I Reverted - you can find them in the commits list on GitHub, too."></p>

<p>Using a hacked version of the latest Ruby with Rails 4.2 means there were several incompatible code chunks in ancient dependencies. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to change tzinfo-1.2.3/lib/tzinfo/ruby<em>core</em>support.rb in its one-liner for "open_file". It was passing the options as a hash, not keywords. Ruby 3.0 keyword-passing changes broke this.</li>
<li>Discourse uses discourse/lib/freedom<em>patches/ams</em>include<em>without</em>root.rb, a horrible old monkeypatch for ActionModel 0.8/0.9, and it causes an infinite recursion. I made discourse/app/serializers/topic<em>list</em>item<em>serializer.rb's method last</em>poster_username return a static string, sidestepping the problem. Sigh.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a new hack, apparently due to something about my hideously-hacked Ruby 3.0 branch that lies about its version number:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to rebuild BigDecimal 1.3.5 to remove three instances of rb<em>check</em>safe_obj() from the C extension code. Since safe mode isn't being used, it does nothing. But it also doesn't link correctly to the (no-op, only a warning) code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty trivial changes, so I shouldn't be unfairly benefiting or penalizing Ruby 3.0 compared to 2.6 or 2.7. The discourse change (probably the biggest for performance) was also made where it would affect every Ruby version, not just 3.0.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>First off, I <strong><em>did not</em></strong> see the occasional crashes with high numbers of threads, that <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">I saw in Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a>. I was worried they were because of my changes to the Ruby code, but apparently it was just that 3.0.0-preview1 wasn't the most stable prerelease. The final released Ruby 3.0 seems to be fine.</p>

<p>Second, when I initially ran 30 batches of 15,000 HTTP requests per batch... The performance numbers were nearly identical. 169.1 reqs/sec, 171.4 reqs/sec and 170.8 reqs/sec. Particularly for version 2.7 versus 3.0, that's well within the noise threshold, where the test is just saying "these look pretty much the same to me." They were within 0.6 requests/second of each other with a standard deviation of 1.39. That's basically identical.</p>

<p>So: Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 had been a few percentage points slower than 2.7. Tested to the same tolerances, Ruby 3.0.0's release version was <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the same speed as 2.7.</p>

<p>I'm a glutton for punishment, so I started another VM instance and ran another 60 batches of 15,000 requests for each Ruby version.</p>

<p>Let's have a table for at least <em>some</em> visual variation, shall we?</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><td></td><th>Ruby 2.6.6</th><th>Ruby 2.7.1</th><th>Ruby 3.0.0</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Median Throughput</th><td>171.1</td><td>173.0</td><td>172.8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Fastest Run of 60</th><td>174.5</td><td>175.5</td><td>176.4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Slowest Run of 60</th><td>168.6</td><td>171.3</td><td>169.2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is once again well within the noise threshold. Ruby 3.0 has a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> bit more variance than 2.7, but by so little that it could easily just be random. And none of these have <strong><em>much</em></strong> variance — nothing that would suggest the test is unstable or that it's getting lots of outliers and averaging them out. The 2.7 and 3.0 results are basically identical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 was a tiny bit slower than 2.7. The release 3.0 is exactly the same speed as 2.7. Preview1 would also occasionally crash for me in a way that might have been the hackiness of my testing... But apparently wasn't. The release version of 3.0 had zero crashes during any of my testing. So I think preview1 was a bit unstable — it happens with prerelease versions sometimes.</p>

<p>Does that mean Ruby 3 failed in its promises? <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so, personally</a>. But that's not what this article is about.</p>

<p>This article is asking "how is the Rails performance of Ruby 3.0.0?" And the answer is "exactly the same as Ruby 2.7.1, which is about two percent better than 2.6.6." You can <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">get more historical perspective on that here</a>. The total comes to 1.75x the speed of (75% faster than) Ruby 2.0.0-p0.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/RRBPerfHistory_720.png" alt="A graph showing the fast-then-slow gain of speed from Ruby 2.0.0-p0 to Ruby 2.7 and 3.0"></p>

<p>If you're into the low-level crunchy details of Ruby performance, <a href="https://fastruby.io/blog/tags/performance">FastRuby.io also has a whole category of performance posts</a> which you may enjoy.</p>

    <p>This is a pure 6510 assembly program for the Commodore 64 made by Bright Pixel in 2019, because why not.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/demo.gif?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a> was a famous 8-bit machine in the 80s and the highest-selling single computer model ever.</p>

<p>Its hardware and architecture set it appart from other 8-bit personal computers at the time. Unlike most of the others, the C64 had dedicated advanced MOS chips for graphics and sprites (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">VIC-II</a>), sound (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581">SID</a>), I/O (the CIA), and many others.</p>

<p>These chips were not only powerful for the time, but they could perform their tasks autonomously, independently of what the main CPU, a MOS technology 6510 microprocessor, was doing. For instance, the VIC-II could generate interrupts on automatic sprite collisions. The CPU and the other chips also shared common data and memory BUSes.</p>

<p>To cope with all these chips inside 64Kbytes of addressable memory, the C64 had something called memory overlay, in which different chips would access different physical data locations for the same memory address. For instance the $D000-$DFFF block could be used for RAM, I/O or access to Character ROM, by the CPU, depending on a $0001 setting. Chips would have to be turned on or off, or instructed to look for data at specific RAM/ROM locations all the time to make the most of the machine as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/0430_-_C64_Mainboard_ASSY250407_RevB.jpg" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>This was impressive in the 80s, for a relatevily cheap mass-market personal computer.</p>

<p>Programming the C64 was more than a lot of fun, it was a form of art. Because of the way all this hardware was packed together, handling the machine meant knowing its memory map and registers by heart, and dominating quite a collection of tricks, some of which weren’t documented at all. What ended up being written for the C64 by the fervent community of developers all over the world went way beyond the imagination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a>.</p>

<p>Today, in 2019, the cult is still alive. There are vast groups of developers still writing C64 games and demos, restoring and using old machines, or using emulators. The SID sound chip was so revolutionary that it still drives a community of chiptune artists <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/8-bit-symphony/8-bit-symphony-pro-double-orchestral-cd-of-8-bit-classics">all over</a> the world. The <a href="https://www.hvsc.c64.org/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> has more than 50,000 songs archived and growing.</p>

<p>At Bright Pixel, we like to go low-level, and we think that understanding how things work down there, even if we’re talking about a 40 years old machine, is enriching, helps us become better computer engineers and better problem solvers. This is especially important in a time when we’re flooded with hundreds of high-level frameworks that just “do the job.” Until they don’t.</p>

<p>This is a simple demo for the C64:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was coded entirely in 6510 assembly.</li>
  <li>It makes use of the VIC-II graphics, character ROM and sprites.</li>
  <li>It plays music using the SID chip.</li>
  <li>Uses raster-based interrupts, perfectly timed.</li>
  <li>Implements a random number generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the source code for it in <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64">this repository</a>, change it and run it a real machine or an emulator. The code is all annotated, and you can use the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/issues">issue tracker</a> to ask us questions or make suggestions, we’ll be listening.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="assembler">Assembler</h3>

<p>We used the <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/">Kick Assembler</a> to build the PRG from the source. KA is still maintained up until today, with regular releases launched every couple of months. It supports <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">MOS 65xx assembler</a>, macros, pseudo commands and has a couple of helpers to load SID and graphics files into memory. Unfortunately, you need Java to run it, but it’s worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Here’s the setup in OSX.</p>

<p>Install Java</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew update
brew install homebrew/cask/java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install Kick Assembler</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/KickAssembler.zip -o /tmp/KickAssembler.zip
sudo unzip /tmp/KickAssembler.zip -d /usr/local/KickAssembler
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should be the contents of /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.cfg</p>



<p>And we have this alias in our ~/.bash_profile for convenience.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias kick="java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="c64-emulator">C64 emulator</h3>

<p>There are plenty of Commodore 64 emulators out there.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/emulator.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/">VICE</a>, the Versatile Commodore Emulator, is a program that runs on a Unix, Win32, or Mac OS X machines and emulates the C64 (and every other 65xx Commodore machine too).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dirkwhoffmann.de/virtualc64/">VirtualC64</a> is an interesting alternative for OSX written from scratch using C++ and native Cocoa and provides a real-time graphical inspector of the CPU, Memory, and the other Chips, while it’s running.</li>
</ul>

<p>We used VICE. One more bash alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias c64="/Applications/x64.app/Contents/MacOS/x64"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging assembly when things go south can be challenging. Back in the 80s, debugging meant spending hours doing trial and error, rebooting the machine, reloading the code from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette">cassette</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541">disk drive</a>, if you were lucky), and writing code to paper just in case you’d lose it in the process.</p>

<p>Luckily, now we have way better tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/debugger.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/">C64 65XE Debugger</a> is a C64 and Atari XL/XE code and memory debugger that works in real-time and embeds the VICE emulator in the same graphical interface. It allows you to see what’s happening with every chip, register, memory block; you can set breakpoints, run the program instruction by instruction, and see what’s happening right in the embedded emulator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The VICE emulator <a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_12.html#SEC271">built-in monitor</a> can also be used to examine, disassemble, and assemble machine language programs, as well as debug them through breakpoints. It has loads of powerful features.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where were these tools in 1986?</p>

<h3 id="graphics">Graphics</h3>

<p>Dealing with graphics is a lot easier now too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">Retropixels</a> is a cross-platform command-line tool to convert any image to Commodore 64 graphical modes and file formats, including Koala (.kla or .koa), which is supported by the Kick Assembler load helpers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate">Spritemate</a> is an online browser-based Commodore 64 sprite editor and supports importing and exporting of the most common file formats, as well as direct Kick Assembler hexadecimal arrays.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sid-songs">SID songs</h3>

<p>SID is short for the MOS 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device, the programmable sound generator chip inside the C64.</p>

<p>A SID file (song.sid) is a special file format, later popularized by modern age SID Players and emulators, which contains both the data and the 6510 code necessary to play a music song on the SID chip.</p>

<p>Here are a few things you should know about SID and SID files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A SID file contains both the data and the code to play the music. The code must reside in a specific RAM address, specified inside the SID file, and changes from music to music, which means that if you want to use another .sid file with this demo, you need to make sure that:
    <ul>
      <li>It starts in the same memory address.</li>
      <li>You change the code accordingly if it doesn’t (advanced).</li>
      <li>It doesn’t overlap with the rest of the memory we need to run our program (Kick Assembler will warn you if it does). RAM is scarce and musics can be big.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can check the SID file <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt">specification here</a>.</li>
  <li>You should absolutely take a look at the <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> and this <a href="https://tamats.com/apps/sid/">SID player &amp; visualizer</a> (<a href="https://github.com/jagenjo/sidviz">github</a>) in javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>Kick Assembler has a helper script to load and parse a SID file directly into your project. <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">loadSid()</a> places the song code and data in the proper RAM location while assembling, and provides the initialization and play subroutines which you can use with your code. Check <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>

<p>These are handy resources you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html">Commodore 64 memory map</a> explaining the functioning of all addresses, registers and memory blocks.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/">C64 Wiki</a> is the online bible of all things Commodore 64, including detailed information of how the hardware works.</li>
  <li>Not the bible, but <a href="https://codebase64.org/">Codebase64</a> is pretty good too.</li>
  <li>A Kick Assembler <a href="https://github.com/gryf/kickass-syntax-vim">syntax file</a> for Vim.</li>
  <li>Understanding the <a href="http://www.coding64.org/?p=164">character and bitmap</a> graphics modes, memory banks, and how the chips interact with each other.</li>
  <li>6510 CPU <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/bmain.htm">instructions</a>.</li>
  <li>Great article explaining the VIC-II <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/26/vic-ii-for-beginners-screen-modes-cheaper-by-the-dozen">screen modes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>

<p>We’ve annotated the .asm sources with all the information you need to understand what we’re doing, why, and where to find more. You can start by looking at the main <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">card.asm</a> file and move from there.</p>

<p>To assemble the sources into an executable PRG file, all you need to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar card.asm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the output should be something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/assembly.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>Here’s a quick run through the main components of this little demo. Find the rest of the information in the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">source</a> itself.</p>

<p><strong>Loading external files with Kick Assembler</strong></p>

<p>Kick Assembler has a couple of helpers to load known file formats into memory at assembly time. We’re using two of these, <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s02.html">LoadBinary()</a> and <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">LoadSid()</a>.</p>

<p>LoadBinary is loading the Koala screen bitmaps we previously converted with <a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">retropixels</a>, while LoadSid is loading the data and code to play the music.sid file. You can check the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a> to see how we handle the music playing and the screen bitmaps in memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.var music = LoadSid("music.sid")
.var picture1 = LoadBinary("screen1.koa", BF_KOALA)
.var picture2 = LoadBinary("screen2.koa", BF_KOALA)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Setting and using the interrupts</strong></p>

<p>We’re using <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">raster interrupts</a> with our demo. These interrupts trigger at specific scan lines that we set with $D012.</p>

<p>First, we need to turn on the interrupts and set the first one when the program starts. This is how:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// disable the interrupts
sei
// first interrupt will be irq1 at scan line 240
setupirq(240, irq1);
// interrupt control - enable all interrupts with $7b
lda #%01111011
sta $dc0d
// interrupt control register - enable raster interrupt with $81
lda #%10000001
sta $d01a
// enable interrupts now
cli
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Later we use the irq1 and irq2 interrupts.</p>

<p>irq1 is triggered at scanline 240, and we use it to change the VIC-II to text mode, scroll the bottom text message and play the music.</p>

<p>irq2 is triggered at scanline 10, and we use it to alternate between the two pictures by switching the VIC-II to bitmap mode and pointing it to the right memory banks.</p>

<p>Here’s irq1 from the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>irq1:
    ack();
    // keep scrolling the bottom line
    jsr scroll_message
    // keep the music playing
    jsr music.play
    // jump to irq2 at line 10
    …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

		<blockquote>
<p>We have made Arm servers&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p>Jon&nbsp;Masters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standards are boring. Satisfied users may not want to migrate to other boards
the market tries to sell&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>So Arm market is flooded with piles of small board computers (<span>SBC</span>). Often they
are compliant to standards only when it comes to&nbsp;connectors.</p>
<h3>But our hardware is not&nbsp;standard</h3>
<p>It is not a matter of ‘let produce <span>UEFI</span> ready hardware’ but rather ‘let write
<span>EDK2</span> firmware for boards we already&nbsp;have’.</p>
<p>Look at Raspberry/Pi then. It is shitty hardware but got popular. And group of
people wrote <span>UEFI</span> firmware for it. Probably without vendor support&nbsp;even.</p>
<h3>Start with <span>EBBR</span></h3>
<p>Each new board should be <span>EBBR</span> compliant at start. Which is easy — do ‘whatever
hardware’ and put properly configured U-Boot on it. Upstreaming support for your
small device should not be hard as you often base on some already existing&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>Add <span>16MB</span> of <span>SPI</span> flash to store firmware. Your users will be able to boot <span>ISO</span>
without wondering where on boot media they need to write&nbsp;bootloaders.</p>
<p>Then work on <span>EDK2</span> for board. Do <span>SMBIOS</span> (easy) and keep your existing Device
Tree.  You are still <span>EBBR</span>. Remember about upstreaming your work — some people
will complain, some will improve your&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Add <span>ACPI</span>, go <span>SBBR</span></h3>
<p>Next step is moving from Device Tree to <span>ACPI</span>. May take some time to understand
why there are so many tables and what <span>ASL</span> is. But as several other systems show
it can be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>And this brings you to <span>SBBR</span> compliance. Or SystemReady <span>ES</span> if you like&nbsp;marketing.</p>
<h3><span>SBSA</span> for future&nbsp;design</h3>
<p>Doing new SoC tends to be “let us take previous one and improve a bit”. So this
time change it a bit and make your next SoC compliant with <span>SBSA</span> level 3. All
needed components are probably already included in your Arm&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>Grab <span>EDK2</span> support you did for previous board. Look at <span>QEMU</span> <span>SBSA</span> Reference
Platform support, look at other <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware. Copy, reuse their
drivers, their&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Was it&nbsp;worth?</h3>
<p>At the end you will have <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware running <span>SBBR</span> compliant&nbsp;firmware. </p>
<p>Congratulations, your board is SystemReady <span>SR</span> compliant. Your marketing team may
write that you are on same list as Ampere with their Altra&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Users buy your hardware and can install whatever <span>BSD</span>, Linux distribution they
want. Some will experiment with Microsoft Windows. Others may work on porting
Haiku or other exotic operating&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>But none of them will have to think “how to get this shit running”. And they
will tell friends that your device is as boring as it should be when it comes to
running <span>OS</span> on it == more&nbsp;sales.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>During a recent “Zoom” lecture a student asked me a question about outliers. In the process of answering I realized something that I knew was true but had never seen explained in any sources. This post is my first attempt to develop an <strong>analogy that connects least squares methods, like regression or PCA, to physical intuition about springs or elastics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-version">The simplest version</h2>
<p>To illustrate I will use data from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html">gapminder</a> conveniently provided in an R package by Jenny Bryan. Consider these two variables in the dataset, GDP per capita and life expectancy, plotted here in a standard scatterplot:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To have a less busy plot, one with fewer points, I’ve subsetted the data to the year 2007 and countries in Asia).</p>
<p>Now we’re going to bring physical intuition into this by imagining these points as physical objects. For example, we can interpret the mean <span>\((\bar x, \bar y)\)</span> = 6252.7, 70.7 as the center of mass (if we assume every point has the same mass). This is the larger, blue point in the plot above. It’s not really important to think of mass specifically, just that this point is the center of the physical ensemble.</p>
<p>We need a few simple rules for our physical system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the data is not allowed, i.e.&nbsp;the points are immovable.</li>
<li>For methods like regression (or PCA), we imagine a rigid object like a line (or hyperplane, in multiple regression) passing through the points, and the points exerting some force that changes the position of this body</li>
<li>If these methods use the standard least squares loss function then this force can be represented by springs or elastics, all of the same length and strength, attached at one end to the points and on the other end to the line (or hyperplane).</li>
</ul>
<p>This line (or hyperplane) may bounce around at first as the springs pull it toward their anchoring points, but eventually it settles into an equilibrium where the forces from all the opposing springs are balanced out. In this equilibrium state we have two immediate consequences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The rigid object (line or hyperplane) <em>must pass through the center point</em>. If it did not, there would be a net force acting on the object pulling it toward the center point, hence it would not yet be at equilibrium. In other words, all of the forces that would <em>shift</em> the object are exactly balanced out so it does not shift.</li>
<li>The same is true about <em>torques</em>, all of the forces that would <em>rotate</em> the object are balanced out.</li>
</ol>
<p>For regression we need one more rule: the springs are guided so they only pull in directions aligned with the axis of the outcome variable, i.e.&nbsp;“vertically.” Let’s call this the <strong>vertical rule</strong> for reference later.</p>
<p>Here is our simple example in picture form:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To create this plot I have copied the <code>geom_spring</code> example by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1331338379636649986">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> from (the new version of!) the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/spring1.html">ggplot2 book</a>).</p>
<p>If you are not immediately convinced that this intuition pays off, consider the issue that motivated me to think of this in the first place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influential_observation">influential outliers</a>, points with high “leverage” in the statistical sense. The definition of statistical leverage is a bit complicated. But we can get the right intuition about it from a physical sense rather than those formal definitions. See the point in the bottom left of the plot above? Since it is pulling closer to the end of the line it has more leverage in the actual <em>physical</em> sense. This is the explanation I prefer to give students who aren’t taking a mathematical statistics course.</p>
<p>(In case you’re wondering, that point is Afghanistan, a nation where the United States remains at war for almost two decades now…)</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when we move this one point so its leverage is being used to rotate the line clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. The old regression line, before this change, is shown as a faded line below for comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>Notice the following changes: the center of mass has shifted a little, the point we moved is now a greater distance from the line so its force is larger, and the line has rotated noticeably due to the influence of this one point, even though our dataset has over 30 points, because that point has a lot of leverage.</p>
<h3 id="hookes-law">Hooke’s law</h3>
<p>Is this intuition correct? Can we really think of least squares solutions (e.g.&nbsp;regression lines) as the equilibrium of a system of springs? Yes, or elastic rubber bands, or any material with linear elasticity, i.e.&nbsp;that follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law">Hooke’s law</a>. Let’s consider how to apply this to regression, where for each point <span>\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> in the data, the spring attaches to the regression line at the point <span>\((x_i, \hat y_i)\)</span>. So the spring is stretched to a length of <span>\(|r_i| = |y_i - \hat y_i|\)</span>, and Hooke’s law says each spring is pulling on the line with a force proportional to this distance.</p>
<p>When the system of the line and springs has stopped moving and settled into an equilibrium, this equilibrium position minimizes the <em>energy</em> of the system, which in this case is just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Potential_energy_for_a_linear_spring">potential energy</a>. The potential energy stored in a spring that is stretched a certain distance is the integral of the force over that distance, and since the force scales with the distance this means the energy scales with the squared distance. Hence, the equilibrium of this physical system <strong>minimizes the total potential energy</strong>:</p>
<p><span>\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2}k |r_i|^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \sum_{i=1}^n  (y_i - \hat y_i)^2
\]</span> where <span>\(k &gt; 0\)</span> is the spring “stiffness” constant. The line that minimizes this is the same as the least squares regression line because the constants in front don’t change the minimizer. This argument works just as well for multiple regression as simple regression, even if we can’t visualize the higher dimensional plots involved. We can still think of springs that are pulling, perpendicular to the <span>\(y\)</span>-axis, on a hyperplane. In this case there can be torques in various different hyperplanes passing through the center of mass but they’re all balanced out, so the hyperplane doesn’t get “tilted” in any direction (if it’s in equilibrium).</p>
<h2 id="principal-components-analysis">Principal components analysis</h2>
<p>Although PCA is often considered a more advanced topic than (simple) regression, its justification in our physical analogy is actually simpler. All we need to do is drop the <strong>vertical rule</strong> that was required for regression. In this case, the springs are allowed to rotate their angle of departure from the points, and their position of attachment to the line (or hyperplane) can slide to accommodate this change in angle. This results in an equilibrium where the springs are stretched as little possible. The total potential energy reaches a lower value because the springs are no longer constrained in which direction they can pull.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>I’ve plotted the line in a different color to emphasize that it’s <a href="https://benediktehinger.de/blog/science/scatterplots-regression-lines-and-the-first-principal-component/"><strong>not</strong> the regression line</a>. Notice that the springs are no longer pulling vertically, instead they connect to the line at the point on the line which is <em>nearest</em> (as measured by overall distance, not just distance in the <span>\(y\)</span>-coordinate alone).</p>
<p>(This is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares">total least squares</a> or a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming_regression">Deming regression</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="model-complexityelasticity-machine-learning-or-ai">Model complexity/elasticity: machine learning or AI</h2>
<p>We can keep building on this analogy by using it to understand more complex modeling methods with another very simple idea: <strong>elasticity of the model object itself</strong>. Instead of a rigid body like a line (or hyperplane), if we imagine it’s made of an elastic material that can be (locally) stretched and deformed then we can get more complex types of regression models.</p>
<p>In this analogy, simpler models like linear regression correspond to more rigid objects like an unbendable metal stick, and more complex models allow flexibility or elasticity when fitting the conditional expectation function like a bendable plastic stick, a rubber band, or even a tensionless string in the most complex case where the model is allowed to fit the points perfectly.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the local polynomial regression method (<code>loess</code>) used by default in the <code>ggplot</code> function <code>stat_smooth</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="624" data-distill-preview="1"></p>
<p>This intuition is not only useful for learning the basic ideas of model complexity and machine learning, it can even be used for cutting-edge research. For example see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06943">recent paper</a> on elasticity in neural networks (by my friend Weijie Su and his coauthor!)</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I think there’s a lot of <em>potential</em> here for statistics education, especially for younger students. It wouldn’t be too difficult to create a physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">classroom demonstration</a> using springs or elastics, especially for the PCA case since that wouldn’t require any guiding tracks to constraint the force direction to be vertical.</p>
<p>I also need to teach myself some more advanced plotting to <code>gganimate</code> these examples. If I succeed I’ll update this page.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>I was surprised by how difficult it was to find any references for this elementary idea that provides physical intuition for such an important method as least squares regression. If you’re aware of any others please contact me because I would be glad to know of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
              <p>It is 1996. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You sit through a bunch of meetings with system integrators, before picking one who promises to deliver your system on time and under budget. They deliver it two years late and a million dollars over budget. Oh well. Your data engineers create and manage data pipelines from your ERP systems, and your data analysts use OLAP cubes to do ad-hoc analyses for businesspeople.</p><p>It is 2006. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You sit through a couple of vendor meetings, before deciding to go all in on the Tableau ecosystem. You hire a small team of data engineers, who set up and then maintain ETL pipelines from your source systems to your data warehouse. They use Ralph Kimball’s dimensional data modeling to transform that data during the ETL step. It’s a lot of work. Your data analysts then copy slivers of that transformed data and perform their analyses on Tableau software running on their own laptops.</p><p>It is 2018. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You don’t bother hiring a data engineer. Instead, you set up a sales call with <a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, and take out your corporate credit card when they ask you to pay for their software. This allows you to pull data from your other cloud software vendors — software services like Salesforce and Mixpanel and Stripe — which you dump into a cloud-based columnar database. You borrow Steve from product engineering for a few weeks to do this. He sets up <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>. You take dbt and use it transform all that data you have in your data warehouse. You release Steve back to his product team shortly after.</p><p>Your data analysts spend their time modeling data, writing tests for said data, and documenting your datasets. They try as much as possible to enable business users to find and manipulate the data for themselves. They’re able to do this because you’ve decided on a tool like Holistics or Metabase or Redash to connect to your cloud data warehouse. Those tools enable easy dashboard and report creation, along with the ability to create and share explorable data marts.</p><p>One day, one of your data analysts comes up to you. “You know,” she says. “This is the first analytics job where things feel different. I’m not dealing with data extracts in Tableau. I’m also not talking to data engineers as much, mostly because all of the data I need is dumped into one data warehouse — I just use dbt.”</p><p>“That’s great!” you say, “What’s the problem?”</p><p>“So I’m spending all this time writing data modeling code, and writing documentation for our data marts and models, and creating dbt tests, and so I don’t spend that much time in raw SQL as much anymore. That worries me.”</p><p>“Why does it worry you?”</p><p>“Well my friends in banks and other companies are still dealing with SQL and data extracts and Tableau visualizations. Sometimes their bosses tell them to go write some longass query and generate a CSV for a VP to inspect. And I’m not doing any of those things. I’m doing this weird set of activities. What if I become unhireable?”</p><p>“Oh,” you say. “Hmm.”</p><p>Your data analyst folds her arms and leans against the door to your office. She watches your face carefully.</p><p>“I guess —“ you say, thinking back to all the previous systems that you’ve watched over, “Well, I guess … maybe this is the data analyst job of the future.”</p><p>And that’s how we got here.</p><p>Two years ago, a bunch of people decided to give this role a new name. They noticed that their jobs had changed, and that the set of things that they produced was strikingly different from all the data analyst roles they’d been in in the past.</p><p>They decided to call this new job ‘analytics engineer’; as opposed to ‘data analyst’.</p><p>Thus, the topic of this blog post.</p><h2 id="the-birth-of-a-new-role">The Birth of a New Role</h2><p>The creation of a new role can be <em>incredibly</em> messy. Back in 2010, I distinctively remember jokes about how ‘data scientist’ just meant ‘overglorified statistician’. It took us a while before we collectively understood that ‘data scientist’ meant ‘someone with more software engineering ability than a statistician, and with more statistical knowledge than a software engineer.’</p><p>Even today, however, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia page on data science</a> sports a line reading “There is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 600w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 1000w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 1066w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We should expect things to be equally messy with analytics engineering.</p><p>It’s worth taking a step back to ask: <em>why</em> come up with a new name for a new role? Why not just call &nbsp;it ‘data analyst’ and be done with it? After all, it is simply the shape of the job that has changed; the outcomes are still identical — data analysts and analytics engineers alike exist to provide business managers with the numbers they need for their decisions. Sure, analytics engineers do different things in their jobs when compared to data analysts, but what they do is very much influenced by the tools and technologies that are available to them.</p><p>There are three reasons for this. (There are probably more, but these three are mine).</p><p>First, because analytics engineers and data analysts do different things, it is useful — from a signalling standpoint — to differentiate between the two kinds of jobs. Companies that use a contemporary data stack are likely to want a different sort of data professional compared to companies that work with data extracts and Tableau. Similarly, analytics engineers who write and maintain data models and data tests would likely want to learn different things compared to data analysts who spend their time arguing with data engineers over their last batch of ETL pipeline requests. A new name allows these professionals to find each other, in what is an already crowded industry.</p><p>This is a good thing.</p><p>Second, analytics engineering requires a different <em>organizational shape</em>. Notice how there’s less reliance on data engineering with contemporary data stacks. Notice also that analytics engineering work is defined by higher-leverage activities: things like creating reusable data models, documenting and surfacing data resources within the business, or building systems to catch bad data early. This is by design: many of the tools that define today’s data landscape were <a href="https://www.holistics.io/books/setup-analytics/data-servicing-a-tale-of-three-jobs/">built in response</a> to the pains of previous generations of data tools; they enable and encourage a higher leverage set of activities.</p><p>The implication here is that a data team that consists of analytical engineers will have to be run differently from a team that consists of the typical ‘data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist’ triptych. It is useful to know that this is the case; calling this out under a different name will make it easier to talk about the organizational changes that companies would need to make when hiring for analytics engineers.</p><p>For instance, the career path for an analytics engineer is likely to be different to that of a data analyst — since the analytics engineer does higher impact things, and is no longer exclusively a junior role. Second, the nature of analytics engineering means that the hiring practices around a data team must change as well; in the dbt blog post about analytics engineering, for instance, Claire Caroll <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/">writes</a>:</p><blockquote>It turns out, your company can get pretty far with a single analytics engineer working as a data team of one supporting a whole business. But for those companies that need a larger data team, how does this team structure scale? Do you simply hire another analytics engineers? Or do you diversify?<p>In our experience, we see team members start to become more specialized, with roles that align more closely with those that we started with. Depending on your needs your next hire may be a data engineer, or a data analyst.</p></blockquote><p>Third and finally, analytics engineering is simply a good excuse for data vendors to reposition themselves. This is good ol’ enterprise marketing, and it is ultimately why so many companies are talking about analytics engineering today (ourselves included!)</p><p>The logic is as follows: you are a BI tool vendor, and you want to stand out from the incumbents. What do you do? The answer: you invent a new category, and then you position yourself as one of the first companies to serve that category.</p><p>Michael Kaminsky wrote <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/">The Analytics Engineer</a> in January of 2019. In October the same year, Claire Carroll of dbt wrote <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/">When did analytics engineering become a thing? And why?</a>. Shortly afterwards, dbt repositioned their entire company to become ‘the analytics engineering workflow tool’, a position that has continued till today:</p><figure><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 600w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 1000w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 1214w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It was perhaps questionable if ‘analytics engineering’ really <em>was</em> a thing in 2019. Sure, the ideas existed in the zeitgeist, but we at Holistics were more familiar with the term ‘dataops’ as a placeholder for these ideas. In 2020, however, the folks at dbt ran <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce">Coalesce</a>, a conference on analytics engineering; they also raised 12.9 million dollars to accelerate this trend. The ideas behind ‘dataops’ seemed to have been subsumed into ‘analytics engineering’ in the months since.</p><p>dbt’s positioning is ultimately why I think analytics engineering will become a thing: they are absolutely motivated to <em>create the category</em>. This is both good marketing, and — to their credit — a good name for a wave that truly exists.</p><p>Now we just have to figure out what it all actually means.</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-analytics-engineering">What <em>Exactly</em> is Analytics Engineering?</h2><p>The honest truth is that we just don’t know.</p><p>In his original blog post on <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/">The Analytics Engineer</a>, Michael Kaminsky wrote:</p><blockquote>While data scientists and analysts are writing a lot of code, being great software engineers isn’t what they’ve been trained for and it often isn’t their first priority. Similarly, while data engineers are great software engineers, they don’t have training in how they data are actually used and so can’t always partner effectively with analysts and data scientists.<p>I believe this gap should be filled in by analytics engineers.

January 20, 2021 | http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/codertodev/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/codertodev/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>Today I read the great article <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/">Are we really engineers?</a> which reminded me about the difference I make between <em>Coder</em> and <em>Developer</em> which in turn made me reflect the question of <em>When do students become Developers?</em></p>
<p>To me, a <em>Coder</em> is someone, who… codes. It is all about cracking out many lines of code and about getting stuff done without too much thinking about architecture and code design. A <em>Developer</em> on the other hand codes but puts also a lot of thought and hard work into architecture and code design. I don’t want to start a flamewar over these exact definitions - I know people call themselves <em>Coders</em> and are what I call <em>Developers</em> and vice versa; that is not my point, I just needed two names to distinguish between these two kinds of archetypes.</p>
<p>Now it seems that in recent years the demand for what I call <em>Coders</em> has gone up substantially which is directly reflected in the education programmes offered: there are a huge number of coding schools both online and also local (real) ones, competing for students. What they teach is <em>coding</em> (it sounds so much cooler than programming, doesn’t it?) in a hip language such as Python.</p>
<p>In my opinion the increasing demand has two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The AI hype in the few last years seems to have caused the impression that <em>everyone has to learn how to code</em> because then <em>everyone has the power of AI at their fingertips</em> which will ultimately <em>magically solve all of mankinds problems</em>.</li>
<li>The industry longs for cheap and readily available workforce to <em>satisfy the AI hype</em> and also <em>simply do the coding</em> of whatever solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>This reminds me of a quote attributed to the great Edsger Dijkstra: <em>Industry suffers from the managerial dogma that for the sake of stability and continuity, the company should be independent of the competence of individual employees. Hence industry rejects any methodological proposal that can be viewed as making intellectual demands on their workers.</em></p>
<p>This is, of course wishful thinking, which would fail horribly - at least for Software Engineering (SE). When we regard <a href="http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/selearning">SE as a learning process</a>, where the shared learning of a team is a core investment, then striving for cheap workforce which can be easily replaced is not going to work. Yes, there are problems which can be solved by cheap workforce “Coders” but they are (hopefully) not your core domain - these problems can be solved by tools / 3rd party frameworks / libraries, outsourced or even implemented by AI ;)</p>
<p>Now contrast this with a “formal” bachelor computer science degree. Coding is basically what students learn in the first 2-3 semesters - therefore, after 2-3 semesters we can regard students as <em>Coders</em>. However in a <strong>real</strong> CS degree students <strong>must not</strong> stop there and in the remaining 3-4 semesters they <strong>have to</strong> make the step towards <em>Developers</em>. Why? Because a proper CS education is more than <em>coding</em>, it is in the end all about concepts and abstractions. Coding is merely a means to an end to explore and express these fundamental concepts and abstractions: architectures, tactical (code) design, design patterns, cohesion, coupling,… Therfore, <em>coding</em> is just a means to an end but it is certainly not a means to an end in itself.</p>
<p>Generally, the tremendously important <strong>initiation rite</strong> from <em>Coder to Developer</em> happens between the 3rd and 4th semester in a larger SE project where students develop a non-trivial (web-based) business solution for a fake customer in groups of around 5 people. It is there, where they are subjected to proper code design such as DDD, design patterns, various architectures, all within a proper (agile) development process with proper treatment of requirements (User Stories,…). Although what students learn in this initiation rite is only a tip of the iceberg, of which they will explore much more when they finally start working in the industry, it is this very first exposure which causes an everlasting change in their thinking and approach to writing software.</p>
<p>Just as every disruptive initiaton rite, it has a deeply transformative effect, changing the student <em>From Coder to Developer</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent a good part of my career in the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) space (g'day Atlassian Bamboo, hello Bitbucket Pipelines 👋). One thing that was clear to me when we built Tability is that we'd have to borrow some ideas from Engineering to solve the OKRs problem.</p><h2>Wait, what's the problem with OKRs?</h2><p>I&nbsp;highly recommend Christina Wodtke's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Radical-Focus-Achieving-Important-Objectives-ebook/dp/B01BFKJA0Y">Radical Focus</a>, as it illustrates one of the common pitfalls of OKRs: people forget.</p><p>Here's how the story goes. A team has grown past the point where the founders can keep track of everything. They start looking for a better way to organize work. They hear/read about OKRs. They love it! They define the first set of OKRs, put it all in a spreadsheet. Everyone is excited. They start working on the top priorities.</p><p>A month later: no one can remember what the OKRs were, and folks are going in different directions again. They put all their efforts into planning and forgot to define a way to track progress.</p><h2>Out of sight, out of mind.</h2><p>Work is paradoxically a powerful generator of distractions. Every project seems to be growing a set of extra features, becoming a giant squid holding the team hostage. Every week is producing dozens of calls, hundreds of emails, taking your attention away from your main priorities. Every task has its own&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns#:~:text=Unknown%20unknowns">unknown unknows</a>&nbsp;taking you down the rabbit hole.</p><p>So, coming back to our OKRs, they're doomed to fail unless we have some sort of framework in place to support them. Not because the team won't care, but because the team won't have the time to think about it —&nbsp;unless we push it back to them.</p><h2>CI/CD principles to the rescue</h2><p>Here's a definition of Continuous Integration taken from Martin Fowler's website.<em>‍</em></p><blockquote><em>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.</em>‍</blockquote><p>Right — this is super tech-centric. So this is not so much about enabling CI in your spreadsheets but more about understanding why it's a popular approach to software development.</p><p>Product teams around the world have adopted CI/CD because they realized that fast iterations produce much better results than doing some grandiose planning with a waterfall approach to delivery. Checking progress early and often reduces the cost of being wrong and allows you to validate your direction by getting feedback from your customers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you look at the 5 principles of Continuous Delivery&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/">published by Jez Humble</a>:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Build quality in</li><li>Work in small batches</li><li>Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems</li><li>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement</li><li>Everyone is responsible</li></ol><p>I absolutely believe that you can and should apply these principle to the OKRs process.</p><h2>The 5 principles of OKRs</h2><h3>Build quality in</h3><blockquote>"It's much cheaper to fix problems and defects if we find them immediately"</blockquote><p>Don't wait until the end of the quarter to realize that one of your Key Results has gone off-track. A daily rhythm for OKRs is too much, but you should check progress on your Key Results every week (ideally a Monday to refresh things after the weekend). Get on top of every KR that has been in the red for more than 2 weeks.</p><h3>Work in small batches</h3><blockquote>"It reduces the time it takes to get feedback on our work, makes it easier to triage and remediate problems, increases efficiency and motivation, and prevents us from succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy."</blockquote><p>Phrases like "we can't track progress before next month" are red flags. The work done to make progress on the Key Results should start producing an impact in a matter of weeks and not months. &nbsp;Don't go for big bangs. Do your best to get incremental progress through the quarter.</p><h3>Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems</h3><blockquote>"The goal is for computers to perform simple, repetitive tasks, such as regression testing, so that humans can focus on problem-solving"</blockquote><p>This one is a cautionary tale against too much automation with OKRs. I've seen cases where teams wanted progress on Key Results to be automatically updated via scripts or integrations, without any human intervention.</p><p>This kills the benefits of OKRs as you lose the problem-solving part. The value of OKRs comes from (1) people being reminded of the top priorities, and (2) people actively thinking about the gap between where they are and where they're supposed to be.</p><p>Full OKRs automation removes the human touch. Computers should help you collect the data, but only your team can interpret it and use it to make critical decisions.</p><h3>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement</h3><blockquote>"Don't treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual."</blockquote><p>I think OKRs suffer a bit from their history. It's a process that is often associated with C-suite and large companies, and it sounds a lot like strategy jargon. That can make it a hard sell for some teams that take it as a different way to do micro-management (and sometimes they're right!).</p><p>OKRs should empower teams and encourage bottom-up innovation — but you need to have the right culture. It means creating space for people to try and fail, and it means investing in the right tools and processes to let your team grow.</p><h3>Everyone is responsible</h3><blockquote>"Everyone works together to achieve the organizational level goals, rather than optimizing for what's best for their team or department."</blockquote><p>OKRs are first and foremost about alignment. The goal is to create a shared North Star and define a common language to describe what success looks like.</p><p>This is also why OKRs should be team-based rather than people-based. It's about doing what's best for the customers and the business, not what's good for each member of the organization.</p><h2>What it means in practice</h2><figure id="w-node-28ee5141bd0f-ec75c961"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7cf835bc0fc5eb13e5c57d/5fb4269265df7bf80f8b2785_weekly-ritual.png.001.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The weekly ritual of Product Teams</figcaption></figure><h3>Check progress every week</h3><p>In a normal Continuous Delivery flow you'd want code to be integrated every day. That's going to be too much for OKRs, and a weekly cadence is more than enough.</p><p>Update progress on Key Results on Monday, then let the team focus on work during the week. They'll have the right context in mind and should be able to make a dent for the next OKRs meeting.</p><h3>Use red/yellow/green statuses to indicate your confidence levels</h3><p>You need a simple way to understand when things are getting off-track. In software it happens when the build goes red. You can get similar results by using traffic lights to indicate your confidence level for each of the Key Results.</p><p>Make sure to keep the history of your checkins! Don't replace existing values in your spreadsheet as it'll prevent you from seeing trends.</p><h3>Make your KRs measurable</h3><p>Avoid binary Key Results (it's shipped/not shipped) or vague statement (users love our product). If you want your team to be effective, you'll need to have concrete ways to measure progress.</p><ul role="list"><li>It's shipped -&gt; We go from 0 to 350 weekly active users</li><li>Users love our product -&gt; We increase our NPS from 20 to 60</li></ul><h3>3 reds = all hands on deck</h3><p>Continuous Integration requires the build to be fixed as soon as it's broken. Things have to be a bit more lenient with OKRs as progress can fluctuate, but I'd recommend having a serious chat on the 3rd red update.</p><p>It won't always be about getting the team to drop everything to focus on one goal. Sometimes you'll realize that perhaps you were too ambitious, or it was the wrong KR to begin with. But — you must have that discussion to get everyone on the same page.</p><h3>Keep it light!</h3><p>Continuous Delivery is only possible if deploying code to production is a breeze. Same goes for updating the OKRs.</p><p>If it feels like a chore or takes people hours to update their KRs, then they'll stop doing it. And if they stop updating their KRs, then they'll soon forget about them. You'd be back to square one.<br></p></div><p>Of course, this is the end of the article where I tell you that we built <a href="https://tability.io/">Tability</a> precisely for that purpose. Anyway, give it a try, it's free and you get unlimited users on every plan!</p></div>]]>

Custom Static Analysis Rules Showdown:<br>
Brakeman vs. Semgrep
</p>
<p>
By Jason Kielpinski (Tech Reviewers: Justin Collins, Erik Cabetas, Clint Gibler)
</p>
<p>
In application assessments you have to do the most effective work you can in the time period defined by the client to maximize the assurance you’re providing. At IncludeSec we’ve done a couple innovative things to improve the overall effectiveness of the work we do, and we’re always on the hunt for more ways to squeeze even more value into our assessments by finding more risks and finding them faster. One topic that we revisit frequently to ensure we’re doing the best we can to maximize efficiency is static analysis tooling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing" target="_blank">aka SAST</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Recently we did a bit of a comparison example of two open source static analysis tools to automate detection of suspicious or vulnerable code patterns identified during assessments. In this post we discuss the experience of using Semgrep and Brakeman to create the same custom rule within each tool for a client’s Ruby on Rails assessment our team was assessing. We’re also very interested in trying out GitHub’s CodeQL, but unfortunately the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24648281" target="_blank">Ruby support is still in development</a> so that will have to wait for another time.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep is a pattern-matching tool that is semantically-aware and works with several 	languages (currently its Ruby support is marked as beta, so it is likely not at full maturity yet). Brakeman is a long-lived Rails-specific static-analysis tool, familiar to most who have worked with Rails security. Going in, I had no experience writing custom rules for either one.
</p>
<p>
This blog post is specifically about writing custom rules for code patterns that are particular to the project I'm assessing. First though I want to mention that both tools have some pre-built general rules for use with most Ruby/Rails projects -- Brakeman has a fantastic set of built-in rules for Rails projects that has proven very useful on assessments (just make sure the developers of the project haven't disabled rules in config/brakeman.yml, and yes we have seen developers do this to make SAST warnings go away!). Semgrep has an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r?lang=ruby&amp;sev=ERROR,WARNING,INFO&amp;tag=security,owasp,best-practice" target="_blank">online registry of user-submitted rules for Ruby</a> that is also handy (especially as examples for writing your own rules), but the current rule set for Ruby is not quite as extensive as Brakeman. In Brakeman the rules are known as “checks”, for consistency we’ll use the term “rules” for both tools, but you the reader can just keep that fact in mind.
</p>
<p>
First custom rule: Verification of authenticated functionality
</p>
<p>
I chose a simple pattern for the first rule I wanted to make, mainly to familiarize myself with the process of creating rules in both Semgrep and Brakeman. The application had controllers that handle non-API routes. These controllers enforced authentication by adding a before filter: <span>before_action :login_required</span>. Often in Rails projects, this line is included in a base controller class, then skipped when authentication isn't required using <span>skip_before_filter</span>. This was not the case in the webapp I was looking at -- the before filter was manually set in every single controller that needed authentication, which seemed error-prone as an overall architectural pattern, but alas it is the current state of the code base. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted to get a list of any non-API controllers that lack this callback so I can ensure no functionality is unintentionally exposed without authentication. API routes handled authentication in a different way so consideration for them was not a priority for this first rule.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep
</p>
<p>
I went to the Semgrep website and found that Semgrep has a <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">nice interactive tutorial</a>, which walks you through building custom rules. I found it to be incredibly simple and powerful -- after finishing the tutorial in about 20 minutes I thought I had all the knowledge I needed to make the rules I wanted. Although the site also has an online IDE for quick iteration I opted to develop locally, as the online IDE would require submitting our client’s code to a 3rd party which we obviously can’t do for security and liability reasons. The rule would eventually have to be run against the entire codebase anyways.
</p>
<p>
I encountered a few challenges when writing the rule:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's a little tricky to find things that do not match a pattern (e.g. lack of a <span>login_required</span> filter). You can't just search all files for ones that don't match, you have to have a pattern that it does search for, then exclude the cases matching your negative pattern. I was running into a <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1892" target="_blank">bug</a> here that made it even harder but the Semgrep team fixed it when we gave them a heads up!
</li>
<li>
Matching only classes derived from <span>ApplicationController</span> was difficult because Semgrep doesn’t currently trace base classes recursively, so any that were more than one level removed from <span>ApplicationController</span> would be excluded (for example, if there was a class <span>DerivedController &lt; ApplicationController</span>, it wouldn't match <span>SecondLevelDerivedController &lt; DerivedController</span>.) The Semgrep team gave me a tip about using a metavariable regex to filter for classes ending in “Controller” which worked for this situation and added no false positives. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My final custom rule for Semgrep follows:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>rules</span>:
<span>-</span> <span>id</span>: controller<span>-</span>without<span>-</span>authn
  <span>patterns</span>:
  <span>-</span> <span>pattern</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>end</span>
  <span>-</span> pattern<span>-</span><span>not</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
        before_action <span>...</span>, <span>:login_required</span>, <span>...</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>end</span>
  <span>-</span> metavariable<span>-</span><span>regex</span>:
      <span>metavariable</span>: <span>'$CLASS'</span>
      <span>regex</span>: <span>'.*Controller'</span>  
  <span>message</span>: <span>|</span>
  <span>$CLASS</span> does <span>not</span> use the login_required filter<span>.</span>
  <span>severity</span>: <span>WARNING</span>
  <span>languages</span>:
  <span>-</span> ruby
</pre></div>

<p>
I ran the rule using the following command: <span>semgrep --config=../../../semgrep/ | grep "does not use"</span>
</p>
<p>
The final grep is necessary because Semgrep will print the matched patterns which, in this case, were the entire classes. There’s currently no option in Semgrep to show only a list of matching files without the actual matched patterns themselves. That made it difficult to see the list of affected controllers, so I used grep on the output to filter the patterns out. This rule resulted in 47 identified controllers. Creating this rule originally took about two hours including going through the tutorial and debugging the issues I ran into but now that the issues are fixed I expect it would take less time in future iterations.
</p>
<p>
Overall I think the rule is pretty self-explanatory -- it finds all files that define a class then excludes the ones that have a <span>login_required</span> before filter. Check out the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">semgrep tutorial lessons</a> if you’re unsure.
</p>
<p>
Brakeman
</p>
<p>
Brakeman has a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/wiki/Creating-Custom-Brakeman-Rules" target="_blank">wiki page which describes custom rule building</a>, but it doesn't have a lot of detail about what functionality is available to you. It gives examples of finding particular method calls and whether user input finds their ways into these calls. There's no example of finding controllers.
</p>
<p>
The page didn't give any more about what I wanted to do so I headed off to Brakeman's <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/tree/main/lib/brakeman/checks" target="_blank">folder of built-in rules</a> in GitHub to see if there are any examples of something similar there. There is a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/checks/check_skip_before_filter.rb" target="_blank">CheckSkipBeforeFilter</a> rule which is very similar to what I want -- it checks whether the <span>login_required</span> callback is skipped with <span>skip_before_filter</span>. As mentioned, the app isn't implemented that way, but it showed me how to iterate controllers and check before filters.
</p>
<p>
This got me most of the way there but I also needed to skip API controllers for this particular app’s architecture. After about an hour of tinkering and looking through <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/tracker/controller.rb" target="_blank">Brakeman controller tracker code</a> I had the following rule:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>require</span> <span>'brakeman/checks/base_check'</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>CheckControllerWithoutAuthn</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>BaseCheck</span>
  <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>Checks</span><span>.</span>add <span>self</span>

  <span>@description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Checks for a controller without authN"</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>run_check</span>
  controllers <span>=</span> tracker<span>.</span>controllers<span>.</span>select <span>do</span> <span>|</span>_name, controller<span>|</span>
      <span>not</span> check_filters controller
  <span>end</span>
  <span>Hash</span><span>[</span>controllers<span>].</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span>, controller<span>|</span>
    <span>warn</span>  <span>:controller</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>name</span>,
          <span>:warning_type</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authN"</span>,
          <span>:warning_code</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:basic_auth_password</span>,
          <span>:message</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authentication for controller"</span>,
          <span>:confidence</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:high</span>,
          <span>:file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> controller<span>.</span>file
  <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

<span># Check whether a non-api controller has a :login_required before_filter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>check_filters</span> controller
  <span>return</span> <span>true</span> <span>if</span> controller<span>.</span>parent<span>.</span>to_s<span>.</span>include? <span>"ApiController"</span>
  controller<span>.</span>before_filters<span>.</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span>filter<span>|</span>
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> call? filter
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> filter<span>.</span>first_arg<span>.</span>value <span>==</span> <span>:login_required</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Running it with <span>brakeman --add-checks-path ../brakeman --enable ControllerWithoutAuthn -t ControllerWithoutAuthn</span> resulted in 43 controllers without authentication -- 4 fewer than Semgrep flagged.
</p>
<p>
Taking a close look at the controllers that Semgrep flagged and Brakeman did not, I realized the app is importing shared functionality from another module, which included a <span>login_required</span> filter. Therefore, Semgrep had 4 false positives that Brakeman did not flag. Since Semgrep works on individual files I don’t believe there’s an easy way to prevent those ones from being flagged.
</p>
<p>
Second custom rule: Verification of correct and complete authorization across functionality
</p>
<p>
The next case I wanted assurance on was vertical authorization at the API layer. <span>ApiControllers</span> in the webapp have a method <span>authorization_permissions()</span> which is called at the top of each derived class with a hash table of function_name/permission pairs. This function saves the passed hash table into an instance variable. <span>ApiControllers</span> have a before filter that, when any method is invoked, will look up the permission associated with the called method in the hash table and ensure that the user has the correct permission before proceeding. 
</p>
<p>
Manual review was required to determine whether any methods had incorrect privileges, as analysis tools can’t understand business logic, but they can find methods entirely lacking authorization control -- that was my …</p></div></div>

The focus of this post is on two important yet lost elements of the pre-modern landscape of Lincolnshire, namely a large area of common land named Lissingleys—very probably the meeting-place for the whole of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey—and the road running north-eastwards from Lincoln to the coast at Grimsby. The latter routeway is first recorded in 1675, but is believed to have originally run along the northern border of this common pasturage and meeting-site, and other place- and field-name evidence suggests that this road may well be of a similar antiquity to the meeting-place itself.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C_lyVZq2UK8/X-nTCtYTVjI/AAAAAAADOxU/qiyfZtxaMroL5Gwv-3ZKZ38YbhI1OYUJACLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/Lissingleys-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="237" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-986EuoGDpsg/X-nTCYtFIpI/AAAAAAADOxQ/h1-5bWtwDZkhzfOc9JTgTcTXTf2wlKeeQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lissingleys-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>(a) Lissingleys in 1820, before its enclosure in 1851, as depicted in Henry Stevens' drawing for the Ordnance Survey&nbsp;(image: Wikimedia Commons);&nbsp;(b) A map of the three ridings of Lindsey set against the pre-Viking landscape of the region, showing the location of Lissingleys at the point at which the three ridings met (image: Green, Britons and Anglo-Saxons, fig. 27).

First, it was an extraparochial area that was considered to lie outside any single ecclesiastical or civil parish until its enclosure in 1851, with the rights of intercommoning here being shared between eight surrounding parishes. Second, there was a concentration of multiple important estates belonging to key landholders within Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey surrounding the site in 1066, implying that access to it was of some importance, although this centrality seems to have evaporated by 1086, when a similar pattern is conspicuous by its absence. And third and most importantly, the land itself lay at the exact point where the boundaries of the three ridings of Viking-era Lindsey met. Indeed, the eight vills that had common rights in Lissingleys were distributed across all three ridings, and the boundaries of these three ridings and their constituent wapentakes moreover look like they have been deliberately adjusted to meet at Lissingleys, suggesting that the site was important even prior to the creation of the ridings (which were probably in existence by <i>c. </i>900, if not before). All of this strongly suggests that Lissingleys was a place of considerable importance to the organisation of Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey and probably pre-Viking Lindsey too, and it has been credibly identified as the meeting-place for the whole community of Anglian and Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey. Support for this conclusion is offered by both the archaeology of the immediately surrounding area and the name Lissingleys itself, as I have argued at length <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/p/britons-and-anglo-saxons-lincolnshire.html">elsewhere</a>. In particular, a strong case can be made for this rural meeting-site having been an important focus in both the Early Anglo-Saxon and Romano-British periods too, with the name arguably containing Late British/Archaic Welsh <i>*liss-</i>, the root of Welsh <i>llys</i>,&nbsp; meaning ‘court, hall’ or ‘parliament, gathering of nobles’ (compare the name Liss, <i>Lis/Lissa</i>, in Hampshire, which also derives from this element).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kW5acYZblLI/X-nXqHauTTI/AAAAAAADOxo/9LyjakXqUREsbb_cXfNciGhZVFk0n-cZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/Lissingleys-parishes-commonrights-manors-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="246" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wLsBkXXrsJY/X-nXp4ZFS2I/AAAAAAADOxk/BpZm5kS0AwAQCslCqpBV04Phck63tVBCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lissingleys-parishes-commonrights-manors-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Two maps showing the parish (red lines), hundred (green line) and riding-and-hundred boundaries (yellow lines) in the immediate area around Lissingleys extraparochial area, shown in purple.

Whether it was always this size or perhaps slightly larger in extent is open to debate; Henry Stevens' draft map for the Ordnance Survey shows a number of old enclosures immediately to the north and south of Lissingleys which might conceivably have originally been parts of it that were lost after its apparent decline in centrality/importance post-1066—if so, then the total original area of Lissingleys could have been up to around 3.1 km² or 765 acres. It is perhaps worth noting in this context that the extent of Lissingleys as mapped by the&nbsp;<i>Historic Parishes of England and Wales: an Electronic Map of Boundaries before 1850</i> project, based on the 1851 enclosure map, seems to be missing an area on the eastern side that is depicted as a definite part of Lissingleys on the 1820 map, so there were clearly alterations to its borders taking place in the modern era. Furthermore, in 1807 Lissingleys was described as comprising 'between five and six hundred acres of very wet land', suggesting that even greater losses of land from Lissingleys may have taken place in the late eightheenth to early nineteenth centuries.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn2">2</a>) As to what occurred here, such meeting-sites as this were a fundamental element of government and society in Anglo-Saxon England, where the free men from across the region (here the three ridings of Lindsey) met to discuss, arrange and decide the judicial, administrative, financial and other business of the region, hence the apparent importance of access to this site that is implied by the clustering of manors of key figures within the region around Lissingleys in 1066. They also frequently became
sites of fairs and occasional markets, sometimes associated with scatters of metal-detected material, and in this context it is worth noting that there is indeed a very extensive multi-period scatter of material found immediately to the south of Lissingleys.&nbsp;</p><p>Another notable characteristic of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian meeting sites is an association with major routeways, reflecting the need for the site to be accessible to all who had to attend it. Unfortunately, Lissingleys nowadays lies away from the major roads of the region. However, there are good reasons for thinking that one of the key highways of pre-modern Lincolnshire actually ran either immediately next to or even across the northern edge of Lissingleys, prior to the remaking of the medieval Lincolnshire landscape by enclosure and the turnpike acts. The road itself, which ran from Lincoln to Grimsby, is first attested by John Ogilby in his 1675 <i>Britannia</i>&nbsp;road atlas, where it was one of 100 major British routeways drawn by Ogilby as strip-maps at a scale of 1 inch to the mile:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-po8-oEov3MU/X-n3taRiGsI/AAAAAAADOyY/cDQYO4ZlShoV-OPGcqtcuisdh3gzEypXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1670/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675.jpg"><img data-original-height="368" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nl9nVAh8zxY/X-n3sH4ArBI/AAAAAAADOyU/csJN6ddSbJ46-JzOhMz5aGZddTfbnEr4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675-small.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A coloured version of John Ogilby's 1675 strip-map of the route from Lincoln to Grimsby, on the right side of the page; click <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-po8-oEov3MU/X-n3taRiGsI/AAAAAAADOyY/cDQYO4ZlShoV-OPGcqtcuisdh3gzEypXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1670/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675.jpg">here</a> for a larger version of this map (image: John Ogilby, <i><a href="http://www.fulltable.com/vts/m/map/ogilby/mna.htm">Britannia</a></i>, 1675, Public Domain).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ogilby's road follows the current Lincoln–Market Rasen road, the A46, north-east from Lincoln for a couple of miles, crossing a 'rill' (Nettleham Beck), a cross-roads with the Old Drovers' Road from Horncastle to Doncaster (mentioned in the early fourteenth century and mapped in the eighteenth), and a heath (Nettleham and Scothern Heath); however, at the point that the present A46 turns eastwards to Dunholme, Ogilby's 1675 road carried on into Welton before turning east and running through the hamlet of Ryland. From here it runs east before rejoining the A46 to cross Snarford Bridge (originally a ford, to judge from the place-name), passing the now-demolished Snarford Hall and Snarford Park, and then runs north-east to Faldingworth Ings and Shaft Wood. At the point the A46 turns north and runs into Faldingworth village, with a minor road running south to Friesthorpe, Ogilby's road then seems to have instead crossed the fields of the southern part of Faldingworth parish directly to Buslingthorpe parish (as the road is indeed depicted as doing on Armstrong's map of 1779 and Cary's map of 1787), where it subsequently is thought to have run to the south of Buslingthorpe village and effectively across the northern boundary of the Lissingleys meeting-site and common pasture, separated from it only by the&nbsp;<i>c.&nbsp;</i>200 metre wide old enclosures mentioned above. At the eastern end of Lissingleys, the seventeenth-century road then turned north and ran along the present-day minor route to Middle Rasen, before turning eastwards onto a 'Green Lane' and across what are now the fields south of Market Rasen to join Mill Road and thus enter the town proper.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn3">3</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xh2IzUcgNGA/X-sayCZIbQI/AAAAAAADO1A/qmUr7SIYKYEckP5otqjVT40VYtha402vQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/LincolnGrimsbyRoad1-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="435" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0lwjEX70WgU/X-saxq3dtLI/AAAAAAADO08/JAG10qSCDeo4JpuK0BB-ooXXFmRn7w4UwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/LincolnGrimsbyRoad1-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A map of the first half of Ogilby's 1675 road from Lincoln to Grimsby as far as Market Rasen, showing the proximity of Lissingleys to the road; note, it deviates from the current A46 in two places, first when it goes through Welton and Ryland before returning to the A46 route just before Snarford Bridge, and second just before Faldingworth, when it carried on across the old open fields to run just to the north of Lissingleys before turning sharply north along a present-day minor road—it carried on along this until just before Middle Rasen, when it turned right along a 'Green Lane' and then across present-day fields to meet Mill Road, Market Rasen.

Leaving Market Rasen north of the River Rase (here named 'Ankam', <i>i.e.</i>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ancholme, of which the Rase is a tributary), it crosses Tealby Moor eastwards to the south of Hamilton Hill before crossing a brook to enter Tealby village. There is no single road following this route nowadays, but there are footpaths and tracks on this route are thought to represent it, although which water-mill is the one mentioned by Ogilby is …</p></div></div></div>

						<p>This an opening post of mini blog post series about various uses of dithering for quantization and sampling in video games. It is something most of us use intuitively in every day work, so wanted to write down some of those concepts, explain and analyze them in Mathematica.</p>
<p>This post is just a table of contents.</p>
<p><a href="https://bartwronski.com/2016/10/30/dithering-part-one-simple-quantization/">Part one – dithering – definition and simple 1D quantization.</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Update April 2020</strong></em>: I didn’t expect to come back to blue noise a few years later, but I <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/26/optimizing-blue-noise-dithering-backpropagation-through-fourier-transform-and-sorting/">wrote a small additional blog post</a> on alternative method for generating blue noise patterns for dithering by “optimizing” frequency spectrum. You can treat it as <strong>part three-point-five</strong>. 🙂</p>

    <h3>Urwhat?</h3>
    <p>
    Given the events of the first few weeks of 2021 and the ensuing discourse
    regarding online communities, decentralized platforms have become something
    of a hot topic. None of these are mainstream in any sense outside of the
    privacy/FOSS/developer community, but some of the more popular ones include
    <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, and <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>. All of these have in common
    the fact that they are part of the "fediverse", a community of self-hosted
    platforms that can interact with each other via the ActivityPub protocol.
    Via ActivityPub, you can see PeerTube videos from Mastodon, people on
    different Pleroma servers can follow each other, your self-hosted blog can
    allow comments via Mastodon, etc. I think these are fantastic projects and a
    step forward for the Internet, but a different project caught my eye
    recently - <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is one of things that is surrounded with so much
        <label for="sn-aesthetic">mystique</label>
        <span id="sn-aesthetic">
            I mean, just look at that aesthetic on their homepage and blog.
            Minimal, enigmatic, and eyecatching. A+ job to the designer.
        </span>
    and promises so much that it is guaranteed to be either revolutionary or a
    complete scam.  The project aims to be not only a peer-to-peer network but
    also include an operating system, virtual machine, not one but two
    (functional!)  programming languages, and an identity system.  These kinds
    of clean-slate, from-the-ground-up reimaginings of computing rarely leave
    the ground, and when they do they're often pretty <a href="https://templeos.org/">unusable</a>.  I just <strong>had</strong> to
    see for myself.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Nine Lightyears Away, Just Outside the Kepler Solar System</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit is trying to be what the Internet was supposed to be, according to the
    ideals of the 1980s. In that prehistoric era, people imagined that the
    Internet would be a peer-to-peer network of individuals freely sharing
    information, unhampered by existing centralized systems or physical borders.
    This, as we now know, never came true. The Internet of today is incredibly
    centralized, and looks more like the computing environment of the 1970s -
    individuals hook up terminals (now phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) to giant
    corporate-owned mainframes (now servers run by Google, Amazon, etc.) that
    store and own all of our data and do the actual computing behind the
    applications we use. Part of why Urbit is such a radical project is because
    it realizes that we can't reverse this process of centralization given our
    current computing infrastructure. If you're tech savvy and willing to front
    the costs you can certainly buy a VPS and host your own stuff, but your
    elderly relatives aren't going to swap out Facebook for an EC2 instance
    anytime
        <label for="sn-ec2">soon.
        </label> <span label="sn-ec2">
            Urbit definitely does not solve the necessity for technical
            competency that's endemic to these kinds of alternative platforms, as you'll
            later see.  I suppose the creators left it up to the end-users to build
            comfortable clients.
        </span>
    Instead, Urbit is a truly personal OS built from the ground up that runs in
    a virtual machine on any Unix system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is not only an OS - it's an identification system.  Each Urbit
    instance exists as a unique member in a hierarchy. In the Urbit universe,
    there are 2^8 galaxies, each galaxy has 2^8 stars, and each star has 2^16
    planets. This gives approximately 4 billion unique IDs, each of which are
    stored as Ethereum tokens. As you might have noticed there's 7 billion
    people in the world at the moment, but only 4 billion IDs for a "personal
    OS" to go around. This is intended in order to create scarcity, making IDs less
    likely to be abused and give users skin in the game when it comes to Urbit
    as a platform. The IDs themselves are all serialized via a pretty quirky
    syllabic naming convention, with rarer entities having shorter names:
    <code>~zod</code> is the name of a galaxy, <code>~taglux</code> is the name
    of a star, and <code>~rovnys-ricfer</code> is the name of a planet.  If you
    don't have an identity yet you can also boot up a free and disposable
    instance called a "comet", which will have a super long 128-bit name like
    <code>~dasres-ragnep-lislyt-ribpyl--mosnyx-bisdem-nidful-marzod</code>. You
    can do so right now after <a href="https://urbit.org/using/install/">installing</a> the Urbit binary and
    running <code>urbit -c comet-name-here</code>. Once you boot up (it'll take
    a while) you should see a prompt appear.
    </p>

    <h3>Beyond the Horizon of Sanity</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit, in terms of software, is composed of several tightly coupled projects.
    The entire inspiration behind building an entire software stack from the
    ground up, and what makes the OS truly peer-to-peer, is the fact that it's
    built entirely of pure functional code. This allows for interesting stuff
    like totally deterministic behavior, the ability to serialize and then
    deserialize the entire machine state, sending and executing code over the
    wire, and its snappy tagline: "An operating function." The actual core OS of
    Urbit is named <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/arvo/">Arvo</a>, the
    assembly code of which is called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/nock/">Nock</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> runtime/interpeter.
    Nock is incredibly low-level but distinct from typical RISC/CISC assembly in
    that it's purely functional so there's no registers, pointer poking, or
    syscalls going on - it's all just S-expressions and operations on
        <label for="sn-lisp">S-expressions.</label>
        <span id="sn-lisp">
        Don't get your hopes up, it's nothing like Lisp. Just similar data
        structures.
        </span>
    I have to say, all of these sleek monosyllabic names get a little tiring
    after a while and do a very poor job of hinting at their purpose for
    newcomers.  Imagine if everything on Unix was named the same way -
    <code>systemd</code>?  Oh, you mean Sarp? <code>libcurl</code>? Yeah, that's
    called Clon now.  At least we're already used to Gimp.
    </p>
    <p>
    Much like how basically everything in Unix is written with C and compiled
    down to assembly, everything on Urbit is written in <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/">Hoon</a> and then compiled
    down to Nock. Hoon is, as you can probably guess by now, a pure functional
    programming language.  When I read this on the tin I got pretty excited, and
    was looking forward to checking out an entire OS written from the ground up
    in something like Haskell or ML or a Lisp dialect.
    </p>
    <p>This was <strong>not</strong> the case. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.</p>
    <p>
    It's truly like nothing I've seen before, and I'd like to think I've been
    around the block when it comes to programming language design. The primary
    ingredient in Hoon is schizophrenia. It makes Terry Davis look like Brian
    Kernighan. To illustrate, let's take a look at <strong>literally</strong>
    the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-school/list-of-numbers/">first
    example</a> in the docs:
        </p><pre>            <code>
|=  end=@
=/  count=@  1
|-
^-  (list @)
?:  =(end count)
  ~
:-  count
$(count (add 1 count))
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
    What does this do? Oh, isn't it obvious? It takes a number <code>n</code>
    and returns a list from 1 to <code>n</code>. No, none of those symbols are
    comments or decorators; every single character above is semantically
    significant. I can deal with complexity where it's necessary, but a short
    look at the docs requires learning a whole new lexicon. The tutorial jumps
    around from concepts like "gates" to "arms" to "runes" to "molds" in such a
    way that it seems deliberately obscure and frustrating. What could possibly
    be so insufficient or broken about, say, functions (after all, it calls
    itself a functional language) that they had to be reinvented? Also - this is
    a minor nitpick, but somewhat representative of the language in general - in
    Hoon, 0 is true and 1 is false <a href="https://youtu.be/5furYtfVuIk">.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Because I have yet to do more with the language than go through the tutorial
    and its exercises a few times, I probably haven't earned the right to be too
    scathing. Who knows, perhaps Hoon is a joy to work with once you pass the
    event horizon and become one with the bits. There's a couple resources
    besides the official tutorial that I'll likely check out in the future:
    there's the <a href="https://urbit.org/community/hoonschool/">Hoon
    School</a> online course (again, if a language requires a six-week online
    course just to learn the fundamentals that should really tell you something)
    and the community-managed <a href="https://hooniversity.org/">Hooniversity</a> tutorial.  I'll leave it
    at this - it's a real achievement that
        <label for="sn-vanes">so much</label>
        <span id="sn-vanes">
        Arvo kernel modules are called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vane/">Vanes</a>, and there are
        quite a few. There's modules for an HTTP client (separate from the
        server module?), peer-to-peer networking, a filesystem, a terminal, and
        a build system to name a few. Not sure what the userspace is like,
        though.
        </span>
    has been written in the language so far.

    <h3>Astroturfing</h3>
    <p>
    Alright, we've decided we're ready for the future of the Internet and want
    to buy in.  Where do we start?
    </p>
    <p>
    Most people just start out with buying a planet. Stars are fairly expensive
    at around $4,000 when I checked at the time of writing this, and galaxies
    are even more expensive and only available via private sale since most of
    the 256 have been given out to contributors/friends of the project. Stars
    and galaxies also represent quite a responsibility because of their dual
    role as infrastructure in the Urbit network, so if you don't want to make
    any kind of commitment then buying a planet is the way to go. There are a
    few places you can buy one - <a href="https://urbit.live/">urbit.live</a>,
    <a href="https://urbit.me/">urbit.me</a>, and <a href="https://planet.market/">planet.market</a> are the first few Google
    results.
    </p>
    <p>
    I decided to get mine on urbit.live. I just chose the first

                    <p>A study was recently reported <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19012651.breakthrough-discovery-reveals-way-reversing-motor-neurone-disease-damage/">in the press as showing promise for a cure for ALS</a>.
Although the content reported by the press is accurate, the interpretation by members of the ALS community is wrong: There is no way (yet) to cure ALS, but on the other hand <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-020-02252-5">the study reinforces and clarifies the long-suspected link between ALS and metabolism</a>.</p>

<p>About 10 to 20% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are familial, with the C9orf72 mutation being the most common cause of familial ALS.
The pathological mechanisms of the C9orf72 mutation in ALS remain unclear. Indeed, the loss of function induced by a mutation of C9orf72 alone does not contribute to the deficits of lysosomal rapid axonal transport in C9orf72 motor neurons derived from stem cells.</p>

<p><strong>Enormous energy needs</strong>
The processes involved in the functioning of motor neurons are all very energy consuming, which raises the question of whether alterations in energy metabolism contribute to defective axonal transport. Apart from alterations in the microtubule machinery observed in a rare mutation causing ALS: FUS, until the present study, however, it had not been shown that the metabolism of motor neurons from ALS patients differed from those of healthy motor neurons.</p>

<p><strong>OXPHOS is the metabolic pathway of mitochondria</strong>
For their energy supply, neurons, unlike astrocytes, are primarily dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS) is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of nutrients, releasing the energy needed to form ATP. In almost all aerobic eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place within the mitochondria.
During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors, such as oxygen, via redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy which is used to form ATP.
This is a very efficient route for generating energy, compared to other processes using fermentation such as anaerobic glycolysis.</p>

<p><strong>The importance of energy from mitochondria in axonal transport</strong>
The extraordinary length of motor neuron axons - 20,000 times longer than the diameter of their soma - suggests a particular metabolic vulnerability of motor neurons to deficits in key processes involved in maintaining axon form and function.</p>

<p>The transport of mitochondrial cargo, unlike vesicular transport, depends on the availability of mitochondrial ATP. Defective transport of the cargo to the distal axon has been reported in several types of ALS, and not just in genes involved in the transport of proteins in the axon. It is well established from animal models of ALS that axon targeting results in delay in disease progression and improved survival and that prevention of motor neuron loss only, but not axonal degeneration, is insufficient to promote patient survival.</p>

<p><strong>Demonstration of a modified axonal transport</strong>
To better understand this question, the scientists studied induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from autopsy of patients containing the most common mutation causing ALS, C9orf72. These stem cells have been matured into motor neurons. They then demonstrate that motor neurons affected by the C9orf72 mutation have (in vitro) shorter axons, an axonal transport of the mitochondrial cargo which is altered and a modified mitochondrial metabolism.</p>

<p>The scientists then show that this deregulation is selective for the spinal (motor) neurons of the anterior horn, and is absent in the spinal (sensory) neurons of the dorsal horn (deregulation in the spinal motor neurons of the ventral horn, but not in sensory neurons of the corresponding dorsal horn).</p>

<p><strong>Gene therapy manipulating PGC1α restores a good phenotype of mutated motor neurons and their axons</strong>
The scientists then carried out by gene therapy an alteration of the genome of the mitochondria in the motor neurons carrying the C9orf72 mutation which are derived from stem cells. This alteration of the genome corrected the metabolic deficit and also saved axonal length and transport phenotypes.</p>

<p>The scientists were able to stimulate mitochondrial function (and biogenesis) through the manipulation of its main regulator, PGC1α, leading to the rescue of axonal phenotypes, providing a new mechanical link between mitochondrial bioenergetics. and axonal dysfunction.</p>

<p><strong>A link with TDP-43?</strong>
These data suggest that targeting the PGC1α pathway may be highly relevant for neurodegeneration, as it is possible that there are other mechanisms leading to axonal dysfunctions observed in motor neurons with the C9orf72 mutation. For example, recent findings show that the repeated proteins of the C9orf72 dipeptide can lead to cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43. Thus, the pathology of TDP-43, observed in the vast majority of ALS cases, including C9orf72, modulates mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating the processing of mitochondrial transcriptions.</p>

<p>Conversely, TDP-43 exerts a toxicity by penetrating into the mitochondria and by specifically altering the OXPHOS I complex and by inhibiting its translation which causes mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

<p>Finally, recent work from Onesto et al. showed that there is compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by the upregulation of PGC1α, in dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with the C9orf72 mutation in ALS.</p>

<p>This suggests that despite the deleterious effects of the mutation, most cell types can compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction by stimulating biogenesis.
The specific vulnerability to motor neurons could result in part from an inability of motorneurones to modulate this homeostatic mechanism when they face too much energy expenditure.</p>

        <section>
            <p>I've been contemplating ways to build more resilient web applications. One consistent issue that seems to crop up in my explorations is that we have no way to execute JavaScript at a given priority.</p>

<p>We can write asynchronous code, but this doesn't provide a general-purpose resiliency primitive.</p>

<h4 id="unyieldy">Un-yield-y</h4>

<p>It is possible to write code that "yields" to allow other code to execute. Writing everything as async functions can accomplish this in specific cases, though only promise chains can be interrupted and it lacks any form of scheduling. This technique relies entirely on authors writing code to be interruptible, explicitly indicating where interruption may occur.</p>

<p>In addition to being opt-in, code that uses async/await, Promises or callbacks is still largely synchronous. The code between each point of asynchrony (await, Promise, callback) can't be interrupted. The following example function can only yield in a single location, the remaining code executes synchronously:</p>

<pre><code>async function amazing() {  
  let items = [];
  let seen = new Set();
  for (let i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {
    let item = await db.get(i);
            // ^ yielding can only occur here
    if (!seen.has(item.name)) {
      seen.add(item.name);
      items.push(item);
    }
  }
  return items;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with the fact that most JavaScript doesn't use async/await or even Promises, makes it insufficient as a general-purpose resiliency primitive. <strong>Most of the JavaScript executed by browsers is synchronous.</strong></p>

<h4 id="whyyield">Why yield?</h4>

<p>There is no language or platform feature that allows for interrupting arbitrary synchronous work in order to prioritize other work. There are a few reasons why we might want such a feature, but the one I find most compelling is to apply resiliency paradigms to <em>existing</em> web code. Effectively, we want the ability to interrupt code wasn't written to be interrupted in order to allocate more time to executing high-priority code.</p>

<pre><code>function veryGoodCode() {  
  const start = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - start &lt; 1000) {} // 🧐
  generateRevenue(); // 💸
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code we run from npm modules, third-party embeds and ads is all given access to the same pool of computing power as an application's core functionality. Multi-process improvements in the browser like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/oop-iframes">out-of-process iframes</a> address this for certain types of content embedded from other origins, which can mitigate the performance impact of things like ads. Unfortunately, we don't have a similar solution for our own applications.</p>

<p>Applications are usually composed out of many distinct parts, but each part currently has the ability to impact the performance of all other parts. <strong>We are missing a platform primitive for composing JavaScript modules while imposing performance constraints</strong>.</p>



<p>I drafted a proposal a while back and shared to various browser engineers, called <a href="https://github.com/developit/element-worklet">Element Worklet</a>. The proposal uses the existing concept of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worklet">Worklet</a>, which is a standalone ECMAScript Module that executes in an isolated environment. This isolation means Worklets can be executed wherever is most suitable: Audio Worklets run on the audio rendering thread, Paint Worklets run on the compositor thread.</p>

<p>Element Worklets are a new type of Worklet that can register Custom Elements. The code for an Element Worklet has access to a limited subset of the DOM API, which allows code to register one or more Custom Elements using the standard <code>customElements.define()</code> method. Custom Elements registered by a worklet must inherit from a global <code>WorkletElement</code> class, and are only able to render into their Shadow DOM (as well as being able to set their own attributes).</p>

<p>Custom Elements registered by an Element Worklet are called "worklet-backed elements". These can be used on the main thread like any standard Custom Element, and can also be referenced from within the Shadow DOM of other worklet-backed elements, enabling arbitrary composition.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<p>The following example shows how a <code>&lt;code-editor&gt;</code> element can be built as an Element Worklet. Doing so encapsulates the code editor implementation so that its performance is not impacted by the surrounding page. It also ensures the page's performance is not impacted by the editor.</p>

<p>First, an HTML page includes the <code>&lt;code-editor&gt;</code> element in its markup the same as it would for a Custom Element. Then, a <code>code-editor.js</code> worklet module script is loaded using <code>addModule()</code>:</p>

<p><code>index.html</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;code-editor value="function foo(){}"&gt;&lt;/code-editor&gt;

&lt;script&gt;  
  customElements.addModule('/code-editor.js');
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>code-editor.js</code> module is loaded in a new JavaScript context, separate from the page and its JavaScript. The module declares a Custom Element class that extends <code>WorkletElement</code>, and uses the <code>connectedCallback()</code> lifecycle method to instantiate <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> within its Shadow DOM. The element also observes "value" attribute changes to update the editor text. Finally, the Custom Element is registered via <code>customElements.define()</code>.</p>

<p><code>code-editor.js</code></p>

<pre><code>import CodeMirror from 'https://unumd.glitch.me/codemirror';

class CodeEditor extends WorkletElement {  
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['value'];
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' });

    this.editor = CodeMirror(shadow, {
      value: this.getAttribute('value')
    });
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(name, prev, value) {
    if (name === 'value') this.editor.setValue(value);
  }
}

customElements.define('code-editor', CodeEditor);  
</code></pre>

<p>Once the worklet module has finished executing and <code>customElements.define()</code> is called, the <code>code-editor</code> element is upgraded on the main thread.</p>

<h4 id="datasharing">Data Sharing</h4>

<p>Custom Element properties set from the main thread are not reflected on a <code>WorkletElement</code>, only attributes. Attribute changes are observed the same as they are in Custom Elements, declared via a static <code>observedAttributes</code> property on the element's constructor. Attribute changes changes invoke <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> on the WorkletElement instance, and may be batched.</p>

<p>Complex data and transferrables can also be shared. The main thread and worklet instances of a WorkletElement each have a <code>port</code> property, which are ports of an MessageChannel specific to that instance, and can be used for message passing. This is similar to how <code>processor.port</code> is provided by audio worklet's AudioWorkletNode/AudioWorkletProcessor.</p>

<h4 id="usecases">Use Cases</h4>

<p><strong>Ads:</strong> Advertisements currently use iframes for encapsulation, a technique of increasing cost as the effects of Spectre mitigations make their way into browsers. Element Worklet could provide a lightweight alternative to iframes for this use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Embeds:</strong> Embedded content like comment widgets, chats and helpdesks all of these currently use some combination of same-origin scripting and iframes, usually mixing origins (eg: a script in the embedder context communicating with an iframe from the embedee's context). Moving from <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> + <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> to Element Worklet seems like a reasonable fit for this case.</p>

<p><strong>AMP:</strong> The semantics defined in this proposal map reasonably well to <code>&lt;amp-script&gt;</code>, and a prototype of Element Worklet has been built using <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom">worker-dom</a>, the library that underpins <code>&lt;amp-script&gt;</code>. AMP's approach is much more broadly applicable than Element Worklet, seeking to support arbitrary third-party code running in a sandboxed DOM environment. However, it's possible a solution like worker-dom would be able to leverage something like Element Worklet to simplify Element registration and upgrades, and to mitigate transfer overhead between threads.</p>

<p><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Component-based frameworks and libraries strive to provide solutions for lazily downloading, instantiating and rendering portions of an application. This process is entirely implemented in userland, which has the unfortunate side effect of making it invisible to the browser. In certain scenarios, it may be possible to use Element Worklet as the underly mechanism for lazily loading and rendering pieces of a component-based User Interface.</p>

<p><strong>UI Component Libraries:</strong> If this model can be shown to provide performance guarantees for Element registration, upgrade and rendering, it's possible a UI library would choose to provide their components as worklet-backed Elements through the use of one or more Element Worklets. This could have interesting implications for performance, since it would provide a way to impose performance guarantees. This is a safety net developers do not currently have for prebuilt modules. The (large) portions of a typical app that are defined by code installed from npm would have less ability to negatively impact the performance of first-party code.</p>

<h4 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h4>

<p>The hard part with such a broad proposal like this is making it something that would be feasible to implement. Part of the design of Element Worklet is aimed at avoiding implementation issues, like the use of a minimal DOM subset and exclusively asynchronous interaction between threads.</p>

<p>As part of investigating whether Element Worklet could be implemented at all, I've created an <a href="#prototype">Element Worklet prototype</a>. The prototype also demonstrates how Element Worklet could be used to control the performance impact of UI components, in addition to insulating their performance from the page.</p>

<h4 id="openquestions">Open Questions</h4>

<p>This proposal glosses over a some details that would be important were it to be implemented in a browser:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What DOM APIs should be available to Element Worklet code? Can <code>WorkletElement</code> provide a sufficient API surface to allow current libraries and approaches to be reused with minimal modification?</p></li>
<li><p>How would a Worklet obtain information that required the main thread to perform layout? (we need <code>async getBoundingClientRect()</code> and friends!)</p></li>
<li><p>Is the level of encapsulation too limiting? Does it fail to meet the needs of the most obvious use-cases like embedded video players?</p></li>
<li><p>Should Element Worklet provide an analog for Custom Element property getters/setters? Could custom properties/methods defined on a WorkletElement …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/">reproducibility is an important aspect of any scientific endeavor</a>.  With Machine Learning being a scientific discipline, as well as an engineering one, reproducibility is equally important here.</p>

<p>There is widespread fear in the ML community that we are living through a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis">reproducibility crisis</a>. Efforts like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">Papers with Code Reproducibility Challenge</a>, signaled a clear call-to-action for practitioners, after a 2016 Nature survey revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">70% of results are non-reproducible</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of the talk amongst the community has centered on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300933">reproducing machine learning results in research</a>, there has been less focus on the production side of things. Therefore, today letâ€™s focus more on the topic of reproducible ML in production and create a larger conversation around it.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-reproducibility-important">Why is reproducibility important?</h2>

<p>
  â€œIf you canâ€™t repeat it, you canâ€™t trust itâ€� - All Ops Teams
</p>

<p>A good question to start with is why exactly reproducibility is important, for machine learning in particular. Here are list of benefits one gains by ensuring reproducibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases <strong>trust</strong></li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>explainability</strong> of ML results</li>
  <li>Increases <strong>reliability</strong></li>
  <li>Fulfills <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>, and <strong>regulatory</strong> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Concretely, ML models tend to go through a lifecycle of being destroyed, forged anew and re-created as <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/technical_debt/">development evolves from rudimentary notebook snippets to a testable, productionized codebase</a>. Therefore, we better make sure that every time a model is (re-) trained, the results are what we expect them to be.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-big-deal">Whatâ€™s the big deal?</h2>
<p>One would think that reproducibility in production ML should be easy. After all, most machine learning is scripting. How hard can it be to simply execute a bunch of scripts again at a later stage and come to the exact same result, right?</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong></p>

<p>Reproducibility of machine learning is hard because it spans many different disciplines, from understanding non-deterministic algorithmic behaviors, to software engineering best practices. Leaving aside the fact that most machine learning code quality tends to err towards the low side (due to the experimental nature of the work), there is an inherent complexity to ML which makes things even harder.</p>

<p>E.g. Just training a model on the same data with the same configuration does not mean the same model is produced. Perhaps one could achieve a similar <em>overall</em> accuracy (or whatever other metric), but even a slight change in parameters might skew metrics for slices of your data - leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">sometimes very unpleasant results</a></p>

<p>So, how can we ensure that stuff like does not happen? In my opinion, one can break down reproducibility in the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code</li>
  <li>The configuration</li>
  <li>The environment</li>
  <li>The data</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Checking code into a version control system like Git ensures a clean trace of how code evolves, and the ability to rollback to any point in history. However, Git alone is not a fix for reproducibility, but only for one aspect of it.</p>

<p>In reality, reproducibility in production is solved by version control, testing of code as well as integrations, and idempotent deployment automation. This is hard to apply in practice. E.g. The main tool for ML is Jupyter notebooks, which are notoriously difficult to check into version control. Even worse, most notebook code is not sequential in its execution, and can have an arbitrary, impossible to reproduce, sequence of execution.</p>

<p>But even if ML practitioners follow a pattern of refactoring their code into separate modules, simply checking modules into source control is still not enough to ensure reproducibility. One needs to link the commit history to model training runs and models. This can be achieved e.g. by enforcing a standard in your team that pins a git sha to experiment runs. That way there is a global unique ID that ties the code and configuration (see below) to the results it produced.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Software Engineering preaches separation of application code and application configuration to allow for predictable and deterministic software behavior across environments. This actually translates well in a machine learning code: E.g. one can separate the model definition and training loop code, from the associated hyper-parameters which define the configuration.</p>

<p>The first step to unlock reproducibility is to actually separate configuration from code in the first place. For me this means, the code itself should NOT define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Split parameters (e.g. 80-20 split)</li>
  <li>Preprocessing parameters (e.g. the fact that data was normalized)</li>
  <li>Training hyper-parameters (including pre-processing parameters)</li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria, .e.g, metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally all these are tracked separately in a <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/declarative_configs_for_mlops/">declarative config</a> that is human readable.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>If a ML result is produced on a dev local machine, there is a high chance it is not going to be reproducible. Why? Because developers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, are not super diligent in creating and maintaining proper virtual environments.</p>

<p>The obvious solution for this one is containerizing applications, with lets say, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>. However, here is another example of when skills of ML practitioners begin diverging from conventional software engineers. Most data scientists are not trained in these matters, and require proper organizational support to help and encourage them to produce containerized applications.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>And finally, we arrive at the data. Data versioning has become one of the most discussed topics in the production machine learning community. Unlike code, you canâ€™t simply check data into version control easily (although tools like <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> are attempting just that).</p>

<p>In the same way as code, achieving basic versioning of data does not necessarily ensure reproducibility. There is a whole bunch of metadata associated with how data is utilized in machine learning development, all of which is necessary to persist to ensure trainings are reproducible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple, but common, example that illustrates this point. If you have ever worked with machine learning, have you ever created a folder/storage bucket somewhere that has random files in varying preprocessing states? Something like, <code>normalized_1.json</code> or perhaps even timestamped <code>12_02_19.csv</code>? Technically, a timestamped file is versioned data, but that does not mean associated runs with it are reproducible: One would have to know how, when and where (i.e. the aforementioned metadata) these versioned files are used to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h3>
<p>While it may fall outside the scope of this blog, the open-source MLOps framework ZenML showcases a clear example 
of putting these principles in action <a href="https://docs.zenml.io/benefits/ensuring-ml-reproducibility.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility in machine learning is not trivial, and ensuring it in production is even harder. ML teams need to be fully aware of the precise aspects to track in their processes to unlock reproducibility.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for a head start to enable reproducibility: check out <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenML</a>, an open-source MLOps framework for reproducible machine learning - and leave a star while youâ€™re there.</p>

This makes Windows servers the top choice for remote desktop connections.</p><p>To run GUI applications, you may have tried VNC (Virtual Network Computing) or xRDP to remotely connect with your Ubuntu server just to realize that it’s not the smooth computing experience you came for!</p><p>A great alternative to the typical VNC network is X2Go.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss the step-by-step process of connecting to an Ubuntu 20.04 remote desktop using X2Go. We’ll also explain why X2Go is a much better option compared to other remote desktop solutions like VNC.</p><h2 id="what-is-x2go">What is X2Go?</h2><p>X2Go is a remote desktop solution that lets you connect with another computer and control it remotely. A few keys features of X2Go are:</p><ul><li>It supports all operating systems including, Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, CentOS, Fedora, and Mac OS.</li><li>It supports voice transmission to the connected systems.</li><li>Multiple users and individual desktop sessions can connect with a single X2Go server at the same time.</li><li>It provides a smooth experience even over low bandwidth.</li></ul><h2 id="when-and-how-is-x2go-helpful">When and How is X2Go Helpful?</h2><p>X2Go can prove to be useful in a variety of scenarios:</p><ul><li>You need to access a Linux-based operating system such as Ubuntu complete with a desktop environment and can’t install it locally.</li><li>You need more resources than your personal computer can provide. For instance, you want to compile a file that’ll take hours making your PC unavailable for long periods of time. Running it on a remote desktop will leave your PC to do whatever you want!</li><li>You want your team to be able to access the resources and benefit from a common computer.</li><li>You want to use the same desktop environment with the same setup, tools, file, and performance from anywhere in the world.</li></ul><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before setting up X2Go we recommend you have:</p><ul><li>A server running Ubuntu 20.04 with at least 2GB RAM.</li><li>A user with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">sudo privileges</code> and SSH key (you can either use SSH keys or set up a password). We recommend a&nbsp;<strong>non-root sudo user</strong> instead of acting as root. This is because when you’re loggen in as root you can do everything and the system won’t ask, so you won’t get to think twice. You could mistakenly run a command that would destroy your system and you’ll wish that the system asked you if you’re sure so you could’ve thought twice.</li></ul><p><strong>So, let’s begin.</strong></p><h2 id="step-1-install-x2go-on-the-server">Step 1 – Install X2Go on the Server</h2><p>The first step is to install <strong>X2Go on the server</strong>. X2Go basically comes with two components:</p><ol><li><strong>Server:</strong> start and manages the graphical session on the remote computer</li><li><strong>Client:</strong> installed on your local computer to view and control the remote desktop</li></ol><p>To install the X2Go server on Ubuntu 20.04, you’ll need to add the X2Go PPA (Personal Package Archive) repository for Ubuntu first. Your server may not have the <strong>add-apt-repository</strong> command available<strong>. </strong>To fix that, run the following command:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt install software-properties-common</pre><p>Next, add the X2Go’s PPA:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable</pre><p>Now, update the software package database:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt update</pre><p>Finally you can install the X2Go server:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession</pre><p>During the installation you’ll be asked to select your preferred Language and Keyboard Layout. Input the number corresponding to your preference and hit ENTER when you’re prompted to do so.</p><h2 id="step-2-install-your-preferred-desktop-environment">Step 2 – Install Your Preferred Desktop Environment</h2><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be installing the XFCE, LXDE and MATE minimal desktop environments for X2Go.</p><p>We’ve also mentioned how to install <strong>GNOME</strong>, even though we haven’t gotten it to work with X2Go.</p><p>XFCE doesn’t use fancy graphical effects like composting which makes it light-weight, hence more compatible with X2Go. LXDE and MATE also work well with composting disabled.</p><p><strong>Display Manager</strong><br> At some point during the install you may also be prompted to choose what default <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/display_manager#Graphical" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" title="Display Manager - ArchWiki" data-wpel-link="external">Graphical Display Manager<span></span></a> you want to install.

    <div>
        <p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.</p>
<p>The recent release of the final rule document was unexpected, and we’re very pleased to see it finally happen. Still, four years overdue with no clear idea of when (or if!) these would ever be released did certainly keep us from putting too many eggs in that stainless steel basket, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some previous suppliers that we had lined up have gone out of business during the pandemic, others have been absorbed by larger companies that have made it clear low volume component production is not something they’re interested in pursuing. In that regard there will be a fair amount of work to be re-done. Perhaps worse, some “champions” we had at various suppliers have retired or moved on. In some cases this has left a void, where before there was a DeLorean fan, who rallied for us within their company and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain staffing candidates that were on our short-list have long since moved on in and while unemployment has increased during 2020, many of the specialized roles that we require are still hard to fill.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in 2015 our planned engine had a life-cycle of emissions compliance through 2022. We had hoped to get into production by 2017 and get 3-4 years out of it before having to take on the engineering for a new powertrain. It’s believed that this engine has been extended through perhaps 2024 now, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to plan around an engine so near its end-of-life.</p>
<p>That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine. While an electric Cobra or Morgan may be a little extreme for their potential market, we’ve already seen that an EV DeLorean – as we displayed at the 2012 New York International Auto Show – is not such an “out there” idea.</p>
<p>Most critically, financial markets have changed, and will change even more as the world navigates the continuing COVID crisis during the Biden administration. Will the financial support that we had lined up a few years ago to carry us through the final development and into production still be available?</p>
<p>As the automotive brand with likely the highest name recognition across all demographics in spite of not having a new product in 40 years, we still believe that none of the above is insurmountable and believe that others will see value in it, as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>

		<p><span>As branding strategies evolve, tech companies continue to find ways to use white-labeling to create profitable apps. White-labeling refers to creating a foundational product or service that can be rebranded and further customized by other companies. This model </span><span>provides a way to service many brands with one product that still looks unique to end users. </span><span>In a previous blog post on </span><a href="https://www.inspiringapps.com/blog/mobile-industry/fintech-and-mobile-app-development/"><span>fintech and mobile app development</span></a><span>, we discussed the capacity of white-labeling to improve app integration and deliver data-driven tools. While there are many advantages associated with the decision to white-label a product, it is not without its challenges. We share our insights on the topic below. Learn how to use white-labeling to create profitable apps given the inherent strengths and limitations of the model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Pros and Cons of White-labeling&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Although the practice of white-labeling apps exists across various industries, the business model for all brands is the same. Suppose you want to create a white-labeled “all resorts” app to service property management companies. This app would need to include features that appeal to virtually all resort managers. For example, the app could include the ability to view specific amenities of a resort upon selection. Property managers could further customize the app each time a resort is added to the product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although creating one product that services multiples resorts is </span>more efficient, this technique has its limitations. A significant con to white-labeling is the appearance of a lack of uniqueness. Using the all resorts app as an example, this product may be less appealing to individual resorts since they don’t want to be listed side-by-side in the same app with their competitors. Resorts would prefer to own their customer relationship and create the impression that they’ve done something unique to serve them.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the model benefits property managers because it is more efficient to maintain one app. It also simplifies things for users since they only need one app to access information about multiple resorts. White-labeled products also cut out the time and expense required to build users’ trust. Instead, companies deliver customized products to their existing loyal customer base. A customer who is familiar with a particular property management company is more likely to book a resort from its app. For this reason, white-labeling is especially useful to industries in which trust is paramount. This is why financial and medical institutions rely heavily on white-labeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Considerations for Developing a Profitable White-labeled Product&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h4><b>Limitations on brand-specific features&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Limitations on brand-specific features substantially impact how producers use white-labeling to create profitable apps. Brands invariably request new features that may only be relevant to them. Offering no brand-specific customization is easiest for white-label providers. The more brand-specific features added to an app, the more difficult it is to maintain the app over time. It is tempting to individualize features in order to appease customers. The temptation is especially strong when a business is starting and revenue is especially critical. However, restricting the number of brand-specific features is key to profitability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cost to develop a white-labeled product is relatively low at the start. Expenses grow over time as more brands (with more needs) are added to the platform. Ideally developers should strive to flatten out the expense curve so that the cost to add a new brand to the app is small. Setting limits on brand-specific customization is key to reaching this goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Publishing Requirements&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The adoption of white-labeled products by multiple companies results in the availability of similar looking products that market themselves as being unique to a specific brand. This outcome inevitably presents a challenge to using white-labeling to create profitable digital products.&nbsp; It has also contributed to some pushback from Apple. Initially Apple chose to reject&nbsp; submissions from white-label providers</span><span>. Apple later relaxed its policy to allow white-labeled products to be created so long as each brand creates its own developer account and publishes its rebranded app through that account. This stipulation aims to strike a balance between Apple’s interest in an “app store cleanup” and the growing popularity of white-labeled products.&nbsp; Developers interested in creating profitable white-labeled products need to stay informed of these evolving restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Adequate Specificity&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The design of white-labeled products needs to be general enough to be adopted by multiple brands yet specific enough to capitalize on niche markets and their goals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-first-white-label-gaming-laptop-now-available-for-2200-will-be-adapted-by-resellers-like-Maingear-Schenker-and-Eluktronics.434609.0.html"><span>Intel used white-labeling to create a gaming laptop</span></a><span> that’s similar to a lot of other laptops but also has qualities that appeal to a specific market. The new product for gaming enthusiasts is conducive to white-labeling due to features including “</span><span>an advanced cooling system, excellent performance, great build quality, a light chassis, and shockingly good battery life.” The same connection between profitability and embodiment of a middle ground between generic and targeted features exists for white-labeled apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Alignment with Emerging Trends&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The most profitable white-labeled products provide services that are becoming increasingly popular. If relabeled products don’t reflect relevant trends, then they are unlikely to provide a launching point from which multiple brands can service a growing need. White-labeled products that are at the forefront of new trends are also able to acquire data that will become increasingly valuable over time. An example of a timely white-labeled product is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-junior-focus/cash-cards-for-kids-digital-banks-race-to-capture-the-next-generation-idINKBN27Y0RY"> Greenlight</a>, a debit card for kids that was recently white-labeled by Chase</span><span>. Fintech is now essential to personal banking. Therefore, apps that capitalize on this growing trend will be highly valuable to top brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>. By doing this you'll be subjecting your eyes to less Blue Light from being on your computer or smartphone. <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Here's an article</u></a> I wrote to help reduce screen time and stay active.</p></li><li id="viewer-9htd6"><p>Try not to look at your devices just before bed. Consider turning off your phone a few hours before bed to avoid letting Blue Light affect your sleep.</p></li><li id="viewer-fo8o1"><p>Consider buying Blue Light filtering glasses, they're widely available and can help to reduce Blue Light if you need to use your devices a lot during the day.</p></li><li id="viewer-aps00"><p>Blue Light screen protectors are also available to buy. If you think you'll forget to wear your glasses then blue light screen protectors can be a useful alternative seeing as you only need to apply it once.</p></li><li id="viewer-fnvc5"><p>Use different lights: LED light bulbs in your house can also emit blue light, so instead of using bright white lights, you could try switching to dimmer red lights closer to bedtime so you are exposed to less blue light.</p></li></ol><h3 id="viewer-82ggv"><span>The bottom line</span></h3><p id="viewer-1fhfe"><span>The bottom line is that most studies conclude that too much Blue Light, especially in the evening, can have a negative impact on your sleep.

For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the <em>open source</em> browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an <em>open source</em> project.</p><p>The browser I’m building, called <a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream">Metastream</a>, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync—no audio or video content is sent.</p><p>If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.</p><p>As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly <strong>70% market share</strong> of all web browsers, soon to include <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite</a>. Waiting 4 months for a minimal response from a vendor with such a large percentage of the market is unacceptable.</p><p>This isn’t something I’m alone in either, <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427">several Electron users</a> have waited months for a response. More prominently, the creators of Brave Browser also had <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/10449#issuecomment-323800130">issues waiting for replies from Google Widevine</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“This is a prime example for why free as in beer is not enough. Small share browsers are at the mercy of Google, and Google is stalling us for no communicated-to-us reason.”<br>- Brian Bondy, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Brave</p></blockquote><p>I’m now only left with two options regarding the fate of Metastream: stop development of a desktop browser version, or pivot my project to a browser extension with reduced features. The latter requiring publishing to the Google Chrome Web Store which would further entrench the project into a Google walled garden.</p><p>If you know of any way to help out, <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/contact">please get in touch</a>.</p><p><strong>April 4th edit:</strong> No response from Google Widevine yet. Because a few folks asked, here is the <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/widevine/gmail-thread.html">full email exchange I had with Widevine</a>. The initial response was received after getting in contact with another browser vendor to ping a Widevine contact they have.

<p>Unfortunately a hardware failure in the disk system of our cloud service provider caused two important servers to go offline yesterday.

<p>Both of the key services related to open-source Qt delivery are affected&nbsp;(download frontend and delivery system master). Mirrors are not affected, so the downloads should be working again as soon as we have the master server for the online installation back online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downloads of open-source and commercial packages are done from different systems, despite using the same installer application. Because of this redundancy the commercial distribution continues to work normally. We also had two separate servers to reduce the risk of failure in the open-source distribution, but unfortunately both of these are affected by the disk system failure at our cloud service provider.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>If you've been following me awhile, you know that I was <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">hired by AppFolio</a> years ago to measure Ruby 3's performance, especially on Rails. This has been a long trip. And that very first project is finally over: Ruby 3 exists and I can check its final, released Rails performance.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>have</em></strong> been following along, the numbers in this post won't surprise you. But it's important to do the final measurement. If you haven't been following, this will bring you up to date.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>What Am I Measuring?</h2>

<p>In concept, I'm measuring "how fast is Ruby 3 versus Ruby 2.6 or 2.7 for a typical real-world Rails workload?"</p>

<p>"Typical real-world workload" is a vague, hand-wavy concept. But there are a lot of specifics that can back it up. I used <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2018/4/2/rails-ruby-bench-what-and-why">Rails Ruby Bench</a>, something I've written for this purpose and used for years now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">Rails Ruby Bench</a> runs a copy of <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a>, a common and popular Rails app to host internet forums. It's one of the biggest available "real" open-source Rails apps, making it a fine choice for "real world" benchmarking. RRB runs a set of simulated pseudorandom user requests against the running Rails app, and times how long they all take to finish. So it's a throughput test. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/11/28/how-do-i-use-rails-ruby-bench">You can run it yourself if you like</a>, though it's a bit complex and finicky. The dark side of using real-world software is hitting real-world complexity and bugs.</p>

<p>The Ruby versions I measured were my hacked Ruby 3.0 versus 2.6.6 and 2.7.1.</p>

<p>RRB has run against AWS m4.2xlarge instances for nearly its whole existence. That's what I'm doing again. For now: m4.2xlarge instances, 10 processes, 6 threads/process, the same as I've been <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/codefolio.html">using for over 3 years</a> for this purpose. With this post, it has fulfilled its purpose: to measure the total speedup from 2.0 to 3.0 of a typical real-world Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>And I can finally stop supporting some hideous old hacks to make that possible.</p>

<p>These results are running 90 batches per Ruby version of 15,000 requests each. That's enough to get pretty solid results, but not to detect the tiniest differences. If you need to detect the tiniest differences in speed, you should probably be analysing your own workload more carefully instead. Anything below about half a percent in speed is going to be dwarfed by differences for your own specific operations. It kinda breaks the abstraction of asking "how fast is Ruby 2.X?" — at some point you don't care about the language generally, you care about the parts of it that you specifically use a lot.</p>

<h2>Methodology and Extra Pitfalls</h2>

<p>This post <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">clearly follows the methodology of my 3.0.0-preview1 review</a>, of course. The main difference is that the Ruby branch was updated to the final release of 3.0.</p>

<p>Since I'm benchmarking with very old code for compatibility reasons, I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/tree/new_fake_2_8">a fake branch of Ruby 3</a> that doesn't remove some of the deprecated features and reports its version number as 2.8 instead of 3.0. The branch includes all the new Ruby 3 code except for <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/commit/17f4f604254b50cdc2c43eb8264f8cbf42c4ce59">a recently-added per-thread deadlock detection feature</a> that replaced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> I still needed for a deprecated feature. The per-thread deadlock detection feature isn't be used in my benchmark, especially because it didn't exist until after Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Here are those reverted features:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/ruby_30_deprec.png" alt="A variety of Ruby 3.0.0 deprecations-turned-errors I Reverted - you can find them in the commits list on GitHub, too."></p>

<p>Using a hacked version of the latest Ruby with Rails 4.2 means there were several incompatible code chunks in ancient dependencies. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to change tzinfo-1.2.3/lib/tzinfo/ruby<em>core</em>support.rb in its one-liner for "open_file". It was passing the options as a hash, not keywords. Ruby 3.0 keyword-passing changes broke this.</li>
<li>Discourse uses discourse/lib/freedom<em>patches/ams</em>include<em>without</em>root.rb, a horrible old monkeypatch for ActionModel 0.8/0.9, and it causes an infinite recursion. I made discourse/app/serializers/topic<em>list</em>item<em>serializer.rb's method last</em>poster_username return a static string, sidestepping the problem. Sigh.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a new hack, apparently due to something about my hideously-hacked Ruby 3.0 branch that lies about its version number:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to rebuild BigDecimal 1.3.5 to remove three instances of rb<em>check</em>safe_obj() from the C extension code. Since safe mode isn't being used, it does nothing. But it also doesn't link correctly to the (no-op, only a warning) code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty trivial changes, so I shouldn't be unfairly benefiting or penalizing Ruby 3.0 compared to 2.6 or 2.7. The discourse change (probably the biggest for performance) was also made where it would affect every Ruby version, not just 3.0.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>First off, I <strong><em>did not</em></strong> see the occasional crashes with high numbers of threads, that <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">I saw in Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a>. I was worried they were because of my changes to the Ruby code, but apparently it was just that 3.0.0-preview1 wasn't the most stable prerelease. The final released Ruby 3.0 seems to be fine.</p>

<p>Second, when I initially ran 30 batches of 15,000 HTTP requests per batch... The performance numbers were nearly identical. 169.1 reqs/sec, 171.4 reqs/sec and 170.8 reqs/sec. Particularly for version 2.7 versus 3.0, that's well within the noise threshold, where the test is just saying "these look pretty much the same to me." They were within 0.6 requests/second of each other with a standard deviation of 1.39. That's basically identical.</p>

<p>So: Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 had been a few percentage points slower than 2.7. Tested to the same tolerances, Ruby 3.0.0's release version was <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the same speed as 2.7.</p>

<p>I'm a glutton for punishment, so I started another VM instance and ran another 60 batches of 15,000 requests for each Ruby version.</p>

<p>Let's have a table for at least <em>some</em> visual variation, shall we?</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><td></td><th>Ruby 2.6.6</th><th>Ruby 2.7.1</th><th>Ruby 3.0.0</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Median Throughput</th><td>171.1</td><td>173.0</td><td>172.8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Fastest Run of 60</th><td>174.5</td><td>175.5</td><td>176.4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Slowest Run of 60</th><td>168.6</td><td>171.3</td><td>169.2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is once again well within the noise threshold. Ruby 3.0 has a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> bit more variance than 2.7, but by so little that it could easily just be random. And none of these have <strong><em>much</em></strong> variance — nothing that would suggest the test is unstable or that it's getting lots of outliers and averaging them out. The 2.7 and 3.0 results are basically identical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 was a tiny bit slower than 2.7. The release 3.0 is exactly the same speed as 2.7. Preview1 would also occasionally crash for me in a way that might have been the hackiness of my testing... But apparently wasn't. The release version of 3.0 had zero crashes during any of my testing. So I think preview1 was a bit unstable — it happens with prerelease versions sometimes.</p>

<p>Does that mean Ruby 3 failed in its promises? <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so, personally</a>. But that's not what this article is about.</p>

<p>This article is asking "how is the Rails performance of Ruby 3.0.0?" And the answer is "exactly the same as Ruby 2.7.1, which is about two percent better than 2.6.6." You can <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">get more historical perspective on that here</a>. The total comes to 1.75x the speed of (75% faster than) Ruby 2.0.0-p0.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/RRBPerfHistory_720.png" alt="A graph showing the fast-then-slow gain of speed from Ruby 2.0.0-p0 to Ruby 2.7 and 3.0"></p>

<p>If you read our other blog posts you might already know that around 90% of the people on our planet are breathing dirty air, and that an estimate of 7 million people die every year due to it <span data-cites="world_health_organization_2018">[1]</span>. You might also know that nearly half a million babies died in 2019 due to dirty air <span data-cites="state_of_global_air">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that dirty air is bad for both children and adults, but all this might be a bit abstract for a parent. This blog post will mainly look at how the air can impact the development of children and how the air quality relates to absenteeism in school, for both children and teachers.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-childrens-cognitive-development">Impact on Children’s Cognitive Development</h2>
<p>There are multiple studies indicating that poor air quality can have an negative impact on a child’s cognitive development.</p>
<p>In a study <span data-cites="wang_2017">[3]</span> carried out in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, it was found that for every increase 2.5µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the pre-teen and teen years, one performance IQ point was lost. Performance IQ is related to ones ability to solve new problems, and it is to a greater extent controlled by brain function, as opposed to something you can learn <span data-cites="boyd-barrett_2018">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In a report by Unicef <span data-cites="rees_2017">[5]</span> it is mentioned how air pollution can impact memory and verbal and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, it is mentioned that test scores and average grades (GPA) have been shown to be negatively impacted by air pollution exposure. Also prenatal exposure is discussed. A study they mention showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution resulted in a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5. In addition to this study, also <span data-cites="monica_2018">[6]</span> shows that exposure during fetal life can have negative consequences on brain development. Air pollution seems to haunt us throughout our whole lives, from foetus to when old (especially if you are male) <span data-cites="un_environment_2018">[7]</span>.</p>
One of the studies referenced in the Unicef report looked at 2,715 children between 7 and 10 years old in schools in Barcelona <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>. The study concludes <q>Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.</q>. However, the editor comments:
<blockquote>
Importantly, these findings do not prove that traffic-related air pollution causes impairment of cognitive development. Rather, they suggest that the developing brain may be vulnerable to traffic-related air pollution well into middle childhood, a conclusion that has implications for the design of air pollution regulations and for the location of new schools. <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span data-cites="emily_2018">[9]</span> researchers looked at children when they were 9 months old and then 3 years old. They observed that exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3. They also looked at indoor damp or condensation (which can be a hint for poor ventilation), and observed that it was associated with reduced verbal ability. Furthermore, they looked at exposure to second hand smoking, which perhaps unsurprisingly was also associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at the commute to school and found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) exposure was associated with diminished growth of working memory <span data-cites="alvarez_2017">[10]</span>.</p>
<p>The findings seem fairly consistent - dirty air is harmful. We therefore believe it is worth paying attention to the air quality in the environments where our children spend a large portion of their early lives. We can not eliminate air pollution exposure, but at least it can be reduced thorugh awareness and taking actions if needed.</p>
<p>Also IQAir has looked at this topic and written an article <q><a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/lp/blog/new-parents/can-clean-air-increase-child-iq">Can clean air increase child IQ?</a></q>. They found some of the same references as we, but also some others. We recommend you to have a look if you are curious about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="cleaner-air-leads-to-fewer-sick-days">Cleaner Air Leads to Fewer Sick Days</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concrete than air pollution’s impact on cognitive development is how it affect the number of sick days. This can naturally also in turn impact a child’s development, since day care (or school) is supposed to be a place where children both have fun and learn new things.</p>
<p>One study <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span> found that with air purification non-attendance was decreased by 55% in a preschool. Another experiment, also in a Swedish preschool, showed a reduced sick-leave of at least 22.5% <span data-cites="jagemo_2019">[12]</span>.</p>
<p>A school in Finland also observed reduced sick leave <span data-cites="genano">[13]</span>, as well as improved concentration, after installing air purifiers. However, we couldn’t find any numbers for how much.</p>
<p>In London, following the release of The Mayor’s School Air Quality Audit Programme <span data-cites="london">[14]</span>, a number of schools followed the recommendation to get air purifiers. 56 teachers were surveyed after getting air purifiers, and more than half of them reported having noticed a decrease in sick leave among themselves and children <span data-cites="blueair_2019">[15]</span>.</p>
<p>There is also some support for reduced absenteeism among teachers with better air quality, for instance <span data-cites="ervasti_2012">[16]</span> found such a connection. We will in the future look into absenteeism at workplaces and its relation to air quality. We suspect there will be more research about that than teachers specifically.</p>
<p>The Västra Götaland Regional Council in Sweden has observed large variations in sick leave among preschools and theorize that this might be due to differences in indoor air quality <span data-cites="vg_2017">[17]</span>. This is expanded on <span data-cites="gustafsson_2017">[18]</span> in Läkartidningen, the official Journal of the Swedish medical association. The doctors point out that the indoor air often has more particles than the outdoor air (in Sweden), both because of indoor activities and that small particles from traffic get in. Children are said to be especially vulnerable to air pollution. The doctors theorize that indoor pollution act as an additional burden on children’s immune system, which risks making it less able to cope with viruses.</p>
<p>Important to note is that many of the above references have links to companies with commercial interests. Sadly, it is hard to find studies without any ties to industry. We found at least two double-blind studies <span data-cites="reisman_1990">[19]</span> <span data-cites="weichenthal_2013">[20]</span> supporting health benefits of air pollution reduction through the usage of air purifiers though. Note that also the European Commission did a research project called SINPHONIE looking at improving air quality in schools and kindergartens. See the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC91160/lbna26738enn.pdf">final report</a> for a deep dive into this topic. They also cover absenteeism, and on top of <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span>, they reference <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47620251_Association_between_substandard_classroom_ventilation_rates_and_students'_academic_achievement">Association between substandard classroom ventilation rates and students’ academic achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11146405_Indoor_air_microbes_and_respiratory_symptoms_of_children_in_moisture_damaged_and_reference_schools">Indoor air microbes and respiratory symptoms of children in moisture damaged and reference schools</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200045_The_Impact_of_School_Building_Conditions_on_Student_Absenteeism_in_Upstate_New_York">The Impact of School Building Conditions on Student Absenteeism in Upstate New York</a>. All in support for that there’s a link between air quality and absenteeism.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe there’s enough supportive evidence for it being worth to make sure that the indoor air quality is good (below <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">WHO limits</a>), and if not, take action. We’ll try to write a new post in the future more focused on what one can do, but meanwhile, some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young child, pay attention to outdoor air pollution and consider an air purifier if pollution is high. It appears that air pollution may be more harmful the younger the child is.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider asking your preschool to get an air purifier if it is located close to heavy traffic or the air quality seems low. Some preschools are already aware of this, for instance <a href="http://eduwingskids.com/air-quality-in-eduwings-kindergarten/">Eduwings</a> have a strategy in place. Sadly it appears that mainly private expensive preschools are using air purifiers, at least in China <span data-cites="dandan_2016">[21]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce indoor activities that can lead to increased air pollution. For instance high temperature cooking, usage of candles or other indoor combustion. A well maintained kitchen hood and ventilation system can mitigate air pollution build-up. But you can also just open your window when cooking with high temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer walking in the forest or through a park rather than along roads with high traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an app, such as <a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-app">IQAir’s Air Visual</a>. It can help you to know when air pollution is high, so that you can reduce air pollution exposure. For instance by staying indoors the worst days, preferably in a room with an air purifier. Or at least avoiding heavy outdoor exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize second hand smoking, especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young children.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TL;DR</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Altman</a> is not
a blithering idiot.<span></span> That’s what’s so scary.<span></span> When the most elitest
minds of a society are full of
<a href="https://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blithering
idiocy</a>, that society is probably doomed.</p>
<p>It’s normal for geniuses to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Frampton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crazed</a>.<span></span> But Sam
Altman (whom I don’t know, but SF is a small town and I probably know
someone who knows him) isn’t a genius and he definitely isn’t crazed.<span></span> He didn’t analyze any ten-dimensional gauge theory or predict any chiral
axigluons.<span></span> He’s just an entrepreneur, i.e., a natural leader, a
commodity which especially in our present dire straits is or at least
ought to be worth a whole Bolivian prison full of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/the-professor-the-bikini-model-and-the-suitcase-full-of-trouble.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cocaine-tooting particle physicists</a>.</p>
<p>What I find exceptionally terrifying is that Altman’s blithering idiocy
looks and sounds <em>exactly like sober good sense</em>.<span></span> <a href="https://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read it.</a><span></span> You’ll agree.</p>
<p>The basic problem with our society is a disconnect between consensus
reality and actual reality.<span></span> We actually have no shortage of natural
leaders.<span></span> But they cannot actually lead us anywhere.<span></span> They are operating
in consensus reality rather than actual reality.<span></span> Their joysticks are
not plugged in.<span></span> When the consensus is nonsense, sober good sense is
nonsense.<span></span> Nonsense is no use to anyone.</p>
<p>Really?<span></span> Can blithering idiocy sound like sober good sense?<span></span> Let’s try
some:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>All of that said, in absolute sense I’d much rather live in the
world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to imagine living in a
world without the Internet.<span></span> However, in the same way that one can feel
acceleration but not velocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual
rate of improvement than the absolute quality of life.<span></span> So even though
people should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to
stand still on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hedonic
treadmill</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic
treadmill is a pain that way.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The world of 1950!<span></span> Oh, honey.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s apply a <em>gross</em> reality check.<span></span> You’re an alien.<span></span> You’re
observing Earth with an infinitely powerful telescope from Alpha
Centauri.<span></span> You have a simple question.<span></span> Since 1950, has human
civilization—or American civilization, which amounts to pretty much
the same these days—advanced or declined?</p>
<p>Apparently the easiest way for Sam Altman to answer the question is to
trade it for a different one.<span></span> He is not alone in this.<span></span> He asks: since
1950, has human <em>technology</em> advanced or declined?<span></span> Clearly, the
alien, you, I, and Sam Altman all have the same answer to this question.</p>
<p>Any question with an obvious answer is a stupid question.<span></span> “Is an iPad
more advanced than a Smith-Corona?” is a stupid question.<span></span> Who asks
stupid questions?<span></span> Obviously, blithering idiots.</p>
<p>But we can compose an interesting question by <em>factoring out</em> the
stupid question.<span></span> Which world would Sam Altman rather live in?<span></span> 2013,
with iPads and teh Internet?<span></span> Or 1950—with iPads and teh Internet?</p>
<p>In a sense, this 1950 is just as real as the “real” 1950.<span></span> Neither
exists.<span></span> Sam Altman cannot pack his bags and move to either the real
1950 or my imaginary super-1950.<span></span> Both exist only as thought
experiments.<span></span> It is not hard to construct or define the super-1950,
though—one run of a time machine, with a printout of Wikipedia, would
be pretty much all the real 1950 needed.<span></span> Send the technology back to
1945, and you’ll have iPads by ’55 at the latest.<span></span> Those guys got things
done.</p>
<p>The interesting (and scary) question this thought-experiment asks is
whether, <em>aside from technical progress</em>, human civilization has
advanced or declined since 1950.<span></span> In actual reality, this too is a
stupid question.<span></span> The answer is no less obvious—I assert.<span></span> But
consensus reality thinks I’m crazy.<span></span> So with stupid we must begin.</p>
<p>Aside from technical progress, has human civilization advanced or
declined since 1950?<span></span> By what criterion?<span></span> If Moore’s Law is not our
benchmark of a successful civilization—what is?</p>
<p>Sam Altman has his answer.<span></span> The hedonic treadmill!<span></span> Never having sold a startup for <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120309/green-dot-buys-location-app-loopt-for-43-4m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$43 mil</a>, there are many subtle, refined and delicious forms
of hedonism of which I am as innocent as a cat of tennis.<span></span> But allowing
(for a moment) this implicit assumption that the purpose of civilization
is the <em>satisfaction of human desires</em>, we can refer only to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s
pyramid of needs</a>.</p>
<p>At the base of the pyramid are air, water and food.<span></span> How does 2013 do at
supplying oxygen, hydration and nutrition?<span></span> How did 1950 do?<span></span> Just
fine.<span></span> Gentlemen, a draw.<span></span> (The food of 2013 is certainly <em>tastier</em>
than that of 1950, at least in America.<span></span> But this is not the base of the
pyramid.)</p>
<p>Next up: safety and security.<span></span> All right, gentlemen.<span></span> Let’s have another
thought-experiment.</p>
<p>Picture the Earth—our beautiful, blue, spinning globe.<span></span> Take all the
habitable land area and color it white—as a neutral background for our
thought experiment.</p>
<p>Now, select the subset of this beautiful planet on which a sober,
sensible, civilized person, such as Sam Altman, would consider it
prudent and safe to wander,
“<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1iEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA481&amp;lpg=PA481&amp;dq=luke+owen+pike+on+foot+and+alone&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FTElxDwO_o&amp;sig=rldp7D6O6fBNUp_gfvEGyD-V3YQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kek9UZKVGsGzyQGRt4HADQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=luke%20owen%20pike%20on%20foot%20and%20alone&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on
foot and alone</a>,” carrying his iPad, at night.<span></span> Leave that part white.<span></span> Color the other part brown.<span></span> Then, from the brown subset, select the
further subset in which Sam Altman, carrying his iPad, would not
consider it prudent and safe to wander <em>in the daytime</em>.<span></span> Color
that part <em>black</em>.<span></span> (Why can’t Google Maps do this?)</p>
<p>Then do the same for Sam Altman’s grandfather, in 1950, with his
portable Smith-Corona.<span></span> Then, repeat the exercise for 1900.<span></span> (Part of
the reason this is such a useful mental exercise, and unfortunately such
a difficult one, is that it requires you to actually <em>know</em> what
the world was like in 1950 or 1900.<span></span> If your way of getting this
information starts with statistical tables, ur doin it rong.<span></span> There are
these things called “books” which will help you out.)</p>
<p>If you perform this exercise accurately, or at least if you get the same
results as me, you’ll see a 20C quite indistinguishable from Stage III
melanoma.<span></span> And this progress continues, to rousing applause and general
self-congratulation, right up into our own dear official NYT-approved
2013.<span></span> Hey, been to Egypt lately?<span></span> What’s that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2047006,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google guy</a> up to these
days?<span></span> Is he still tweeting?</p>
<p>Speaking of Twitter, I experience this reality check in person every
day.<span></span> My daughter’s preschool is at 10th and Howard, two blocks from
Twitter HQ.<span></span> It’s actually not too hard to park at 10th and Howard.<span></span> So
the average number of what my daughter calls “dangerous persons,” and what to an
ordinary grownup are basically indistinguishable from zombies, that I
and my bubbly daughter have to navigate around between the car door and
the security guard is… I don’t know… 1.3?<span></span> 1.7?<span></span> It can’t
be much more than&nbsp;2.</p>
<p>They’re just zombies and really they’re not that dangerous.<span></span> (I think
even zombies can sense that when I’m with a child, I am more dangerous
to them than the converse.)<span></span> On the other hand, a couple months ago a
techie (not a Twitter employee) was hit on the head and killed,
presumably by zombie or zombies unknown,
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SoMa-assault-victim-dies-4229551.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at
11th and Mission</a>.<span></span> Right around the corner from Tweet Central.<span></span> Besides
a couple of perfunctory boilerplate stories, and of course the victim’s
wife, no one noticed.<span></span> No one cared.<span></span> Why would they?<span></span> Their iPads have
<em>4.7 million pixels</em>.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that if you don’t know how 1950 would have reacted to
exactly the same event, in exactly the same place, you don’t know
anything about 1950.</p>
<p>Actually, my daughter’s preschool is <em>literally in a ruin</em>—that
is, a (nicely renovated) space which used to be part of a Catholic
church.<span></span> (The preschool is the former convent.<span></span> The rest of the church
remains a
<a href="http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM5QC2_St_Josephs_Church_and_Complex_San_Francisco_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruin</a>
proper.)<span></span> Where are the people who used to pray in this church?<span></span> They
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>fled</em></a>.<span></span> Why?<span></span> Because they were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>afraid for
their physical safety</em></a>.</p>
<p>I know, I know.<span></span> It’s
<a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/white-philly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gauche</a> to even
bring this kind of stuff up.<span></span> It’s not part of our consensus reality.<span></span> It’s not part of our consensus <em>history</em>.<span></span> When it comes to
<em>actual</em> history, however, the global decline of security in the
second half of the 20th century is (I assert) the salient phenomenon of
our era.<span></span> Much as the fall of the Roman Empire is the salient phenomenon
of 4th-century AD Europe.<span></span> (Note that while our historians would
desperately love to find one, just one, member of the exquisitely
literate 4th-century AD European culture who would even <em>mention</em>
that the Roman Empire was falling apart, no such luck.<span></span> It’s all
wall-to-wall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudentius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prudentius</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidonius_Apollinaris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sidonius</a>.)</p>
<p>Consider our alien in Alpha Centauri.<span></span> His telescope is just a
telescope.<span></span> He no speaka the English.<span></span> He is absolutely invulnerable to
our most respected propaganda authorities and in particular has no way
to read the great Harvard scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pinker</a>—truly a Prudentius for
our age—who has <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> through elaborate statistical models that
the 20C was not, in fact, the golden age of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">titanic
mass murder</a> and
<a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/43688725792/how-do-you-steal-a-bike-asking-for-a-friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brazen
petty crime</a>, but the dawning of a new age of Aquarius in which all will
have peace and prosperity.<span></span> (Even Pinker is a piker next to the Times,
which has published at least 547 stories about NYC’s miraculous conquest
of its
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/nyregion/new-york-police-department-manipulates-crime-reports-study-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly
managed</a> crime statistics, and precisely 2 about the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/nyregion/28crime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital
statistics</a> which show a parallel doubling in actual assault victims.<span></span> It’s always so easy to lie to those who want to be lied to—you hardly
even <em>need</em> statistics.)</p>
<p>But his is an excellent telescope.<span></span> So our alien can <em>see</em> the fact
that many parts of all, and all parts of some, American cities that were
thriving in 1950, have now fallen into chaos and ruin.<span></span> On the other
hand, he can gaze admiringly at the thriving cafes of University Avenue
in Palo Alto, Ausonius’
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/deciausonius01ausouoft#page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moselle</a>
born anew, full of beautiful young people adoring the perfectly
antialiased individual subpixels of their new Retina iPads.<span></span> Which of
these phenomena will he find more relevant?<span></span> Which is the narrative,
which the distraction?</p>
<p>Continuing the comparison to the fall of Rome, one of the interesting
features we see is that while technological competence is certainly an
indicator of a successful civilization, it is also a <em>lagging</em>

January 20, 2021 | https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/a-simple-and-efficient-real-time-application-powered-by-materializes-tail-command/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within the web development community, there has been a clear shift towards frameworks that implement incremental view maintenance and for good reason. When state is updated incrementally, applications perform better and require fewer resources. Using Materialize, developers and data analysts can adopt the same, event driven techniques in their data processing pipelines, leveraging existing SQL know-how. In this blog post, we will build an application to demonstrate how developers can create real-time, event-driven experiences for their users, powered by Materialize.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
This post is the fulfillment of the goals that I had when writing <a href="https://materialize.com/streaming-tail-to-the-browser-a-one-day-project/">Streaming TAIL to the Browser</a>. That post is not required to understand this post but familiarizing yourself with the <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/#main">TAIL command</a> is recommended.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Demonstration of What We Will Be Building</h3>
<p>In this post, we are going to use the demo from our documentation’s <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/">Get Started tutorial</a> as the basis for building a minimal web application. The application allows users to see the total number of edits made to Wikipedia, as well as a bar chart of the top 10 editors. Here is an animation that shows the final result:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>
<hr>
<p>Want to run this demo yourself? Awesome! Clone our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize">repository</a> and follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/ea5a6f0603875b752745838eb1228a90fc7e8476/play/wikirecent#running-it-yourself">Running it Yourself</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Desired Properties of the Solution</h3>
<p>Before jumping into how to build this, let’s outline the desired properties for our solution. The final solution should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-Based</strong> – Instead of having the client poll for updates, updates should be initiated by the server and only when the client state is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Clients should present both a consistent and complete view of the data, regardless of when the application is loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Unbuffered</strong> – Clients should receive updates as soon as changes are made to the underlying datasets, without arbitrary delays in the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> – Size of updates should be a function of the difference between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, clients should not be required to replay state from the start of history.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> – Applications modifying the source data (writers) should not need to know anything about the applications consuming the data (readers).</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible for other applications to meet several of these properties, I hope that this application will demonstrate why the solution presented is ideal for this scenario. A discussion of why this application meets the above properties, and why other solutions likely do not, is presented further down in this post.</p>
<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with our getting started demo, here is the flow of data in our pipeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Looking at the system diagram below, we see that the entire data pipeline is contained within a single materialized instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Let’s discuss the role of each service in the diagram above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you started the application, you can run <code>mzcompose ps</code> to see the containers started.</p>
<hr>
<h4>curl — wikirecent_stream_1</h4>
<p>This container runs <code>curl</code> to stream Wikimedia’s recent changelog to a file called <code>recentchanges</code> within a Docker volume shared with our materialized instance.</p>
<h4>materialized — wikirecent_materialized_1</h4>
<p>This container runs an instance of <code>materialized</code>, configured to tail the <code>recentchanges</code> file and maintain our two materialized views: <code>counter</code> and <code>top10</code>. The views in this instance are configured exactly as documented in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/#create-a-real-time-stream%22">Getting Started – Create a real-time Stream</a>.</p>
<h4>Python web server — wikirecent_app_1</h4>
<p>This container runs a Python web server that hosts the code for our JavaScript application and converts the row-oriented results from <code>TAIL</code> to the batch-oriented results expected by our application.</p>
<h2>Building Our Application</h2>
<p>Our example application is an asynchronous Python web server built using two libraries: <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html">Tornado</a> and <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a>. There are three components to our application that I would like to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python code to subscribe to materialized view updates using the <code>TAIL</code> command and&nbsp;convert the row-oriented results into batches.</li>
<li>Python code to broadcast batches to listeners.</li>
<li>JavaScript code to apply batch updates for efficient browser updates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Materialize uses the word <em>batch</em> to refer to a data structure that expresses the difference between prior state and desired state. You can think of a batch as a “data diff”.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Output for Our JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>To efficiently update our client view state, we wish to present a stream of batches over a websocket to any configured listeners. We define a batch as the following:</p>
<pre><code>batch = {"inserted": [ // array of rows to add to our dataset
],
"deleted": [ // array of rows to remove from our dataset
],
"timestamp": 0 // Materialize-defined timestamp
}
</code></pre>
<p>When a client first connects, we send a compacted view of all batches from the beginning of history:</p>
<pre><code>def add_listener(self, conn):
    """Insert this connection into the list that will be notified on new messages."""
    # Write the most recent view state to catch this listener up to the current state of the world
    conn.write_message(
        {
            "deleted": [],
            "inserted": self.current_rows,
            "timestamp": self.current_timestamp,
        }
    )
    self.listeners.add(conn) # subscribe to the stream of batches
</code></pre>
<p>How can listeners bootstrap their state using a batch object? If there is one property that I find particularly beautiful about this solution, it’s that first batch applied to an empty list <em>is</em> our initial state. This means that initializing and updating are the same operation. This batch object is so useful that D3’s <a href="https://d3js.org/#enter-exit">update</a> and Vega’s <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_change">change</a> APIs expect updates to come in a similar form.</p>
<p>However, results from tail are row-oriented. We need a little bit of code to convert from rows to batches; here is an example of the desired conversion:</p>
<pre><code># We need to convert this stream of rows...
1608081358001 f -1 ['Lockal', '4590']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Epidosis', '4595']
1608081358001 f -1 ['Matlin', '5220']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Matlin', '5221']
1608081359001 t \N ['\\N', '\\N']

# ...to this data structure.
timestamp = 1608081358001
inserted = [('Epidosis', '4595'), ('Matlin', '5221')]
deleted = [('Lockal', '4590'), ('Matlin', '5220')]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code to subscribe to view updates and transform rows into batches.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to TAIL</h3>
<p>To process rows from <code>TAIL</code>, we must first declare a cursor object that will be used to indefinitely iterate over rows. To help with our code know when to broadcast an update, we ask for progress markers in the response:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view(self):
    """Spawn a coroutine that sets up a coroutine to process changes from TAIL."""
    async with await self.mzql_connection() as conn:
        async with await conn.cursor() as cursor:
            query = f"DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR TAIL {self.view_name} WITH (PROGRESS)"
            await cursor.execute(query)
            await self.tail_view_inner(cursor)
</code></pre>
<h3>Converting Rows to Batches</h3>
<p>We’ve now created a communication channel which can be used to await results from the tail query. Whenever our view changes, our application will be notified immediately and we can read the rows from our cursor object. <code>tail_view_inner</code> implements the logic to process rows and convert them to batches:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view_inner(self, cursor):
    """Read rows from TAIL, converting them to updates and broadcasting them."""
    inserted = []
    deleted = []
    while True:
        # Block until there are new results (FETCH is not buffered)
        await cursor.execute(f"FETCH ALL cur")

        async for (timestamp, progressed, diff, *columns) in cursor:
            # The progressed column serves as a synchronization primitive indicating that all
            # rows for an update have been read. We should publish this update.
            if progressed:
                self.update(deleted, inserted, timestamp)
                inserted = []
                deleted = []
                continue

            # Simplify our implementation by creating "diff" copies of each row instead
            # of tracking counts per row
            if diff &lt; 0: deleted.extend([columns] * abs(diff)) elif diff &gt; 0:
                inserted.extend([columns] * diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Bad data from TAIL: {row}")
</code></pre>
<h3>Updating Internal State and Broadcasting to Listeners</h3>
<p>Now that we have a batch object, we apply this change to our own internal <code>VIEW</code> and broadcast the change to all listeners:</p>
<pre><code>def update(self, deleted, inserted, timestamp):
    """Update our internal view based on this diff."""
    self.current_timestamp = timestamp￼

    # Remove any rows that have been deleted
    for r in deleted:
        self.current_rows.remove(r)

    # And add any rows that have been inserted
    self.current_rows.extend(inserted)

    # If we have listeners configured, broadcast this diff
    if self.listeners:
        payload = {"deleted": deleted, "inserted": inserted, "timestamp": timestamp}
        self.broadcast(payload)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Design Decision</strong>:<br>
Experienced readers will note that by maintaining an internal copy of the view in our Python web server, we can reduce the number of connections to the materialize instance. This is a strictly optional design decision that I made when writing this code — materialized connections are very light-weight when compared to other databases. We expect that there will be use cases where you will want one or more materialized connection per user. Consider temporary materialized views feeding dashboards personalized to each user, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of this application, I opted to reduce the connections out of habit rather than necessity. It does also enable a larger degree of fan-out, if we wanted to serve millions of clients, for example.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Updating User Views</h3>
<p>Now that we have looked at the code for broadcasting an update, let’s show how our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/play/wikirecent/app/src/templates/index.html">JavaScript code</a> consumes these batches. Our application is showing two things: a <em>total edits counter</em> and a <em>top 10 chart</em>:</p>

        <section>
            <article>
                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>

                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.

	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

                <li>A process needs to be able to have more than one input port, and needs to be able to choose which one to receive from! </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>When Darwin introduced evolution with <em>The Origin of Species</em>, not only did it change how we saw life on earth, but it turned out to be much more general than we thought. We see it everywhere: from how innovation happens, how languages and cultures form, to how markets operate. </p><p>When you look at the world through the lens of evolution, what’s opaque becomes common sense and your vision of the world changes in kind.</p><p>The same, I think, can be said with Nassim Taleb’s <em>Incerto</em>. Yes, I have just compared him with Darwin.</p><p>Time will tell, but I think it’s merited. I’ve re-read Taleb’s work at least four times now, and each time I come out with new realizations. Similar to evolution, his ideas of Black Swans and Antifragility sprout up all around us. It can change everything from how you eat, how you work, how you build friendships, how you invest, how you innovate, and much more.</p><p>I wanted to share the most impactful idea that I got out of it with you. This is my own words, and it is nowhere near enough to capture his work’s complete implication. I hope it gives you an exciting lens and piques your curiosity enough to read Taleb’s books.</p><p>The place to start is with the question: <em>how does the future happen</em>? </p><p>We often think that it’s an unfolding of predictable events. It certainly seems that way when you read history. For example, we learn that World War I was an obvious consequence: countries were arming and had all these pacts, so of course, the war was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>But this is one of the most incredible illusions of all. With World War I, for example, we went from assassination in Austria-Hungary to an all-out war between superpowers in a matter of…<em>one week</em>. </p><p>No one predicted that. It would be analogous to China and America declaring hostilities next Friday. </p><p>This idea would have been hard to swallow before 2019, but I think enough has happened for us to reflect. No one predicted the exact consequences of COVID. No one expected that protesters would storm into the capitol building in January.</p><p>If breathtaking changes can happen in a matter of days, we need to revise our beliefs about how the future unfolds. </p><p>It’s not predictable. Instead, what Taleb calls “Black Swans” drive the future. These are events that are so unlikely that they’re unpredictable and so consequential that they change reality as we know it.</p><p>And that puts us in an uncomfortable situation — in a world dominated by events you can’t predict, how do you live your life?</p><p>Here comes, I think, one of Taleb’s most meaningful insights. You can’t know the future, but you <em>can</em> know how well you could handle it.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. Take anything, and ask yourself: how would this react if something <em>out of the ordinary</em> happened? </p><p>For example, think about a piece of expensive china. Just about anything out of the ordinary would break it. At best, nothing terrible will happen. At worst, it will disintegrate. You could say that this piece of china is <em>fragile</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now let’s look at a kettlebell. Up to a point, just about anything out of the ordinary would do <em>little harm</em> to the kettlebell. In most cases, nothing terrible will happen. It won’t suddenly become any better, but at least it won’t break. We could say that this kettlebell is <em>robust</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now, consider this essay itself. If someone reads it and sees that it’s wrong, that person could let me know, and I would fix it. If they’re furious and make a fuss on the internet, it only gets more people reading it. And of course, if people love it, again more would read it. At <em>worse,</em> this essay will stay the same. In many cases, it will benefit. You could say that this essay is <em>antifragile</em> towards the unexpected <sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “triad” — fragile, robust, antifragile — and you can start to identify just about all aspects of life within it.</p><p>Just exploring this triad can fill you with insights. For example, tinkering is antifragile. Banks are fragile. Gold is robust. Dollars are fragile. Individuals are fragile at the expense of the collective, which is antifragile. Why, and what does it mean? Expounding on the consequences would take a series of books… so you can appreciate the beauty and breadth of Nassim’s work. </p><p>For this essay, I’ll focus on just one slice of one thing. What can you do with this triad in your own life? </p><p>Well, you can learn to <em>love</em> the future. If you can organize your life so that you remove your fragility and add antifragility, you can, as Nassim says, <em>“be the fire and wish for the wind.”</em> </p><p>Here’s how. Look over your life, and start to catalogue your exposure. </p><p>Is your work fragile, robust, or antifragile?
Are your finances fragile, robust, or antifragile? 
Are your attachments fragile, robust, or antifragile?</p><p>Now, take all that is fragile, and try to move them towards robust. </p><p>Here’s an example. Say you have most of your net worth invested in stocks. Are your fragile, robust, or antifragile? </p><p>Well, imagine if your portfolio increases by 20%. You’ll be happy for sure. But, imagine if your portfolio <em>decreases</em> by 20%. Likely, you’ll be devastated. You have more to lose than to gain from the unexpected here. This means that you are <em>fragile</em> in your investments. </p><p>How can you move this towards robust? Two ways. </p><p>The first is philosophical. Just write off a large part of your investment mentally. Maybe 50% <sup>2</sup>. Now, even if a 50% downturn happens, you only got what you expected. Arguably, you are robust towards the unexpected. </p><p>The second is practical. Move to more robust investments: stuff like gold, very cheap real estate in a small, resilient country, etc. </p><p>At this point, you may ask — you don’t <em>just</em> want robust. How can you <em>win</em>? </p><p>Well, now it’s time to add antifragility. </p><p>Can you set aside some amount for crazy risks? You can write this portion off completely, so at worst, what happens is what you expected: you lose it all. However, at best, you have upside. </p><p>The key is to choose the kind of activities that have a profound upside. If one win pays for a thousand losses, you are in a good place. How does this look? </p><p>Here’s a basket of ideas: start a company, invest in highly speculative ideas, make a youtube video, write a book, move to a city that excites you, learn to program, tinker, share. If you do that, suddenly, you can’t wait to see what the future holds. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “Barbell Strategy” — change your exposure to 90% robust, 10% antifragile. </p><p>Here’s one more example. Say you have a slight headache. There’s a new medication that could fix it. Should you take it? </p><p>Well, in the best case, your headache is gone. But since it’s slight, this is not such a big deal. At worst, who knows what can happen? Here, you are <em>fragile</em> towards this medication.</p><p>Now, imagine you are about to die, but a new, experimental medication can save you. At worst, you die, which is what you expect to happen. But, in the best case, you survive. Here, you are <em>antifragile</em> to this medication. </p><p>Wow. We've just used the triad as a compass for our life. Note the beauty here: at no point have we talked about specific risk modeling. It’s so simple that you don’t need any math. That’s pretty darn beautiful.</p><p>And with that, we learn one of the most interesting ideas: it’s not about predicting the future; it’s about not having to predict the future. </p><p>You know what books to check out for a much deeper, broader, and sometimes hilarious view. </p><p>Fair warning, though: the biggest complaint with Taleb is that he comes off as arrogant. I honestly think this is a misunderstanding in tone. Imagine whenever you read him that you’re talking with an animated elder, under a sunlit garden in Lebanon, with a good bottle of arak. You’ll see humor where there was arrogance.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Alexey Gurevich, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em> </p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Even before the World Heath Organization (WHO) assigned Coronavirus pandemic status, people were already coming up with “creative” ways of avoiding infection, some more effective <a href="https://www.gatechecked.com/some-nervous-travelers-are-wearing-water-jugs-to-protect-themselves-against-coronavirus-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than others</a>.</p>
<p>Masks and face shields are still selling like hot cakes as hundreds of thousands of cases are recorded daily globally. Some companies have turned to more creative ways of capitalizing on the sudden demand for safety wear. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/biovyzr-venture-out-breathe-easy#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioVYZR</a>, for instance, is developing a consumer grade Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) and plans to introduce it to the market starting at $249. For reference, industrial PAPRs sell for well over $1,500.</p>
<p>For those who may not want to look like they’re suited up for a trip to the International Space Station, another startup company called MicroClimate has also developed their own smaller protective helmet, called the <a href="https://microclimate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIR by MicroClimate</a>, which honestly looks like something from the dystopian future.</p>

<p>The AIR helmet tries to solve some of the problems faced when wearing masks. For starters, the unit features HEPA-filtered inlets and outlets, and has high-powered fans to keep air moving through the helmet, preventing stale air from collecting and fogging up the glass. According to the website, the battery provides the fans over 4 hours of life, and can be charged via the provided 6 foot long USB-C cable.</p>
<p>The big benefit here is the clear acrylic visor, taking away some of the “annoyances” of wearing traditional masks, like actually being able to see the person’s entire face and not having to struggle understanding what people say through those thicker cloth masks. Finally, the lower section has a washable cushion liner, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods.</p>

<p>With no mention about how sound travels through the device (maybe through the cloth lining at the back), I’m guessing the wearer would have to constantly be on the verge of a shouting match in order to be heard. Even though it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XF4AsTtuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks relatively easy</a> to take off, I’m sorry for the folks out there who suffer from the regular runny nose.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

  <p>Jan 20, 2021</p>




&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I moved this website “worldofmatthew.com” away from CloudFlare back in August 2020.</p>
<p>That should have been the end of the relation with CloudFlare for my website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was moving the L7 Anti-DDOS protection to path.net (via a reseller), I checked the SSL Transparency and noticed that CloudFlare still had a <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=3006080109&amp;opt=ocsp">vaild SSL certificate for this website</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, this CloudFlare certificate lasts for a year, meaning they have a SSL certificate for this website, until June 2021.</p>
<h2 id="irrevocable-ssl-certificates-by-cloudflare">Irrevocable SSL Certificates by CloudFlare</h2>
<p>This website currently uses path.net for DDOS migration. Just like CloudFlare, they have their own SSL certificate for this website. As they require it to MITM website requests to block anyone trying to perform an L7 attack.</p>
<p>The difference is that path.net uses Let’s Encrypt, which would allow me to revoke their SSL certificate for this website. All I would have to do is to download the public key and present that with an Acme challenge and then I can revoke it.</p>
<p><strong>You would think that it would be possible to get a CloudFlare SSL certificate revoked?</strong></p>
<p>How about No?</p>


<center>
<picture>
	<img src="https://worldofmatthew.com/img/2021/01/cfupgrade.png" alt="Cloudflare charging $10 for a web master to have control over SSL.">
</picture>
</center>

<p>Well. Unless you want to pay CloudFlare $10 per month to gain access to the “<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a>”.</p>
<p>This would give access to use a custom Let’s Encrypt. This would also allow you to set your SSL certificate validity period to as low as 14 days, rather than a year on the free “Universal SSL”.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a case of pay CloudFlare $10 per month or they get 100% control over your SSL certificate and will deny your requests to revoke.</p>
<p>In fact, the official stance of the SSL team at CloudFlare is that they won’t revoke unless the team has “<a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/revoke-and-prevent-the-issuing-of-certificates/235478/28">determined the private key was compromised</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this sounding pretty corrupt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes….</p>
<p>You blindly trust that CloudFlare will delete the SSL certificate upon leaving. They will provide you zero evidence of them of actually deleting the certificate.</p>
<p>This is from a CDN who has a level of access unmatched by their rivals. CloudFlare are becoming the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">defualt DNS for browsers</a> and have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>You have to trust them to never abuse that power.</p>
<p>Even worse, as they forcibly keep a working SSL certificate, they don’t even have to generate a new one. Meaning, SSL transparency <strong>WILL NOT</strong> show anything if CloudFlare ever decide to hijack and MITM traffic to your website.</p>
<p>If someone asks that a SSL certificate is revoked after leaving it, revoke it. The webmaster is no longer giving them permission to have a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>By not allowing for SSL certificates to be revoked, CloudFlare is in effect holding them hostage. It must not be the job of a Certificate authority to refuse such requests.</p>
<p>Most Certificate authorities would never lock a webmaster out of control of a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>They also would not tell people to pay of $10/month for get rights to revoke a Certificate.</p>
<p>This comes to a question of whether CloudFlare should even be in SSL chain-of-trust.</p>
<p>I requested for them to revoke, by not revoking Cloudflare are keeping an active SSL Certificate without my permission. I think such behavior should make browsers question if they can keep Cloudflare in their chain-of-trust.</p>

									<p>The German government is “keen to enter into talks” with the new U.S. administration to agree changes to the U.S. policy that prioritizes local coronavirus vaccine supply at U.S. production facilities, according to a document from the German health ministry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a lengthy document published Tuesday that responded to questions from Germany’s Social Democrats, the health ministry sets out why the U.S. was able to secure additional supply of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines for specific dates, whereas the EU's increase in supply is set to come “in 2021.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The health ministry states that an executive order from the U.S. president meant that production facilities in the country are “encouraged to initially make vaccine available for supply in the USA.” This meant that European production sites of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, as well as the Moderna vaccine, need to supply the rest of the world, in addition to Europe. </p>

<p>“The companies as well as the federal government are keen to enter into talks with the new U.S. administration in order to reach adjustments,” wrote the health ministry.</p>
<p>The document also discussed the bilateral deal Germany has with BioNTech/Pfizer — something that the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-coronavirus-vaccine-side-deal-at-odds-with-legally-binding-eu-pact/">Commission has let Germany off the hook for</a>, even though it appears to go against the bloc’s effort to craft a united vaccine strategy. </p>
<p>At issue, the health ministry explained, is the funding received by BioNTech from Germany’s education and research ministry. This cash meant that BioNTech had to provide a portion of vaccines to Germany. As a result, the health ministry had to issue a pre-contractual letter of intent in the form of a memorandum of understanding on September 8 for 30 million additional doses of the vaccine, wrote the health ministry.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>There’s no better time than now to dedicate effort to reliable software</em>.</p><p>If it wasn’t apparent before, this past year has made it more evident than ever: People expect their software tools to work every time, all the time.
The shift in the way end-users think about software was as inevitable as our daily applications entered our lives, almost like water and electricity entered our homes. A global pandemic accelerated that expectation as our livelihoods adjusted to be dominantly online for entertainment, saying hello to loved ones, and doing our jobs.</p><h2>Customers want reliable software.</h2><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a great chance an outage disrupted your life in one way or another. It could be the hours-long Slack, Gmail, or Zoom outages. Or it could be trying to watch a show on Disney+ or Hulu. Or when market volume skyrocketed, sending several brokerages down like TDAmeritrade and Robinhood.</p><p>Website blips and outages had a level of empathy associated with them in the internet’s early days. Dial-up connections would be disconnected by someone merely picking up the phone. Servers would get turned off on weekends for government websites. Restarting our computers was a common remedy that was largely tolerated. Those days are behind us, and ahead is a new expectation from people using our services: they expect them to be reliable.</p><p>The software industry is wising up to the fact that incident response already has precedents. Google’s incident response is based mainly on the United States FEMA disaster recovery processes. Remediation runbooks to restart servers take cues from the airline industry with quick actions that operators can perform. Software teams perform incident retrospectives and publicize their findings to their customers and the world, much like how the investigation of airline disasters has happened for years.</p><p>Customer trust is sacred, and poor reliability is one of the top ways to erode that trust.</p><h2>Operators want reliable software.</h2><p>I’ve never been paged in my career and been excited to open my laptop at a restaurant, even though I have several times. Reliable software means that software engineers can stay focused on company initiatives such as shipping new products or improving internal development processes. When reliability becomes an afterthought of software, it has wide-reaching implications. For example, software engineers can easily fall into the trap of happy-path only development, ignoring the possibility of failure entirely.</p><p>Over time, disruptions caused by a lack of reliable software causes an engineering team to enter into a brutal interrupt-driven development phase. Interrupt driven development is also the easiest way to burn out an entire engineering team. When you have burned out engineers that suddenly depart, it can cause an organization to overhire to cover ground. Hiring at a breakneck pace can also cause a cultural shift in the company, potentially generating more employees to leave. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p>If you write software or manage a team that writes software, try performing proactive reviews of software that is planning on being deployed. Ask questions like “how can this potentially break?” and “what is a potential side effect of this change?“. Ask engineers to add it to their pull requests, design docs, and release notes. Incident retrospectives are a lagging indicator of how people thought the system would behave when a few questions can often reveal problems before they’re problems.</p><h2>How do we achieve reliable reliability?</h2><p>Reliability is an infinite game. There’s no agreed-upon rules, no time limit, no teams to play against. Reliability is what you want it to be, and it’s up to your team and leadership to decide the level of reliability you want to achieve. There’s no panacea to software reliability; it’s what you do every day, week, and month that creates reliability. It’s the simple consistency of caring drives reliability.</p><p>With that said, here are a few ways to put a team into first gear towards destination site reliability.</p><h3>Leverage your incident retrospectives and put your learnings into action</h3><p>As a starting point, you can start by analyzing and learning from incidents through retrospectives (p.s. drop the term “postmortem,” no one died). Take the time to understand what everyone was doing to resolve the incident, why they were doing it, and under no circumstances blame anyone for an outage. Primarily, you’re trying to understand how an incident came to be. By identifying multiple contributing factors, no singular root cause, you can spend time in each of the identified areas and plan actions accordingly.</p><p>While retrospectives are a great way to understand why something failed, it’s almost more important to know why things work at all. If our SLAs designate we’re available 99.99% of the time, why are we spending time looking at 0.01% of the time for ways to be more reliable? Read the paper on  <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/signuptosafety/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/10/safety-1-safety-2-whte-papr.pdf">Safety-II</a>  for more information on this idea. I also loved being in the audience for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-2jMlsPqc8&amp;feature=emb_title">this talk</a>  by Ryan Kitchens.</p><h3>Push the limits with Chaos engineering</h3><p>Trying to “break things on purpose,”  <a href="https://gremlin.com/">a Gremlin mantra</a> , is a great way to build resilience and reliability. The vaccine of outages is causing them intentionally so your team can react and build better software. Chaos engineering is one of my favorite ways to engineer better systems.</p><p>I also believe chaos engineering practices apply to more than just breaking software; it should include breaking processes, too.
Watch  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2sf2lb2-4I">Incident Ready: How to Chaos Engineering Your Incident Response Process</a>  to see what I mean.</p><h3>Enable your teams to quickly turn things on and off with release &amp; feature flags</h3><p>Feature flags aren’t a new idea, but there are more reasons than ever to start using them in your software stack. Complex systems and deploys sometimes need a light switch to make something go dark in the event of a failure. I suspect this is why LaunchDarkly chose the name they did. FireHydrant uses  <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>  extensively in nearly every new feature we build to roll them out to our customers slowly.</p><p>I’ll give you an example of a real-life feature flag: airplane spar valves. If an engine shutdown fails, pilots will shut a spar valve completely, cutting off fuel to the engine, allowing it to starve and shutdown. I imagine we’ll start seeing feature flags and release flags used more frequently for circuit breakers in complex applications in the same way pilots use spar valves for turning off engines in dire situations.</p><h3>Know what’s in your complex system by cataloging your service</h3><p>In any sufficiently complex system, the number of running applications will surpass an individual’s cognitive ability to keep track of them all. The inner workings of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of microservices exceed our brainpower. It’s essential to have an “address book” of all of the services you rely on. YellowPages (remember those?), if you will, so we know where the service is, who to call when it degrades, and its purpose. It would be best if you documented what is out there, what the service does, who owns it, and who knows the most about it (hint: these are commonly not the same people).</p><p> <a href="https://firerescuemagazine.firefighternation.com/2013/07/14/understanding-the-dispatcher-s-job/">Dispatchers are a critical part</a>  of the response process for getting the right fire station to the emergency as fast as possible. Dispatchers have a catalog of battalions, fire stations, and the neighborhoods they serve. Without knowing who is where and where emergencies are, dispatching emergency services would be significantly less efficient.</p><h3>Have a plan and a central knowledge base with simple runbooks</h3><p>I’ve seen nearly every company I’ve worked for have an alert fire when a database starts to approach its max disk capacity. After some time, the alert inevitably fires, and then a collective “ok, what now?” face trades between everyone. Simple runbooks are an excellent way for a team to develop the beginnings of shared knowledge, breaking down the tribal knowledge that likely exists, which is only revealed in crisis.</p><p>Runbooks are nothing more than a checklist, which Atul Gawande’s book  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-checklist-manifesto-how-to-get-things-right/9780312430009">The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</a>  covers extensively. With simple checklists, ICU units in Michigan saw a reduction of 66% in infection rates. Within 18 months, the simple checklists saved an estimated 1500 lives.</p><p>These simple lists work, and we can achieve even more reliable software with them.</p><h2>SLOs</h2><p>Reliability is hard to measure, but implementing service level objectives is a great way to start. My recommendation here is to create SLOs that don’t measure CPU or Memory usage but instead measure customer happiness. I fear most on-call engineers have been paged in the past for benign problems such as “memory is at 80%“.  <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos">By alerting on SLOs</a> that measure customer experience, not computer vitals, we’re targeting a better sense of what reliability in our system truly means.</p><p>As for a book recommendation on implementing practical service level objectives, I highly recommend  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/implementing-service-level-objectives-a-practical-guide-to-slis-slos-and-error-budgets/9781492076810">Implementing Service Level Objectives</a>  by Alex Hidalgo.</p><h2>Every day is a chance to be more reliable.</h2><p>When striving for reliable systems, I urge you to remember that shavings make a pile. There’s no singular action you can take to build reliable software. Reliability is a habit that everyone must buy into and practice every day.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>Is it better to have no facts about a topic and thus no opinion, or have access to a few â€œout of contextâ€� facts and thus a misinformed opinion?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Either start learning about issues you care about, or stop caring about them so much. Itâ€™s more honest, less mental effort, and is less likely to ruin Thanksgiving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You canâ€™t be well-informed on every topic; Itâ€™s just not possible. Thatâ€™s why world leaders have advisers. Yet somehow, if you look at anyoneâ€™s Facebook account, you donâ€™t have to try too hard to figure out their view on any political issue.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Iâ€™ve started to realize how much nuance there is to the headlines we see. When I read an article that ruins the image of a company or individual, I always wonder: What information could the author be omitting? What view could the other side have? What outside information is the author conveniently using to make a point?</p>
<p>I try to avoid getting emotional until these questions are answered. Iâ€™m guilty of having basic gut feelings on unfamiliar topics, but these feelings arenâ€™t strong enough to start an argument. I talk about issues Iâ€™m informed about, and listen (with a grain of salt) to others talk about issues Iâ€™m not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isnâ€™t the case for lots of us. Instead of admitting we are uninformed, many of us form an opinion after we read the headline, and most likely donâ€™t update it after skimming the article with said headline. We are even less likely to look for an opposing take, as that requires we scroll outside of whatever feed we are browsing through. Some people donâ€™t even use the news to form opinions: They just accept the opinions of their friends or family as â€œobviousâ€�. As someone who accepted the outcome of the 2020 presidential election without looking into the claims of fraud, Iâ€™m guilty of this too.</p>
<p>We then take this opinion that a) isnâ€™t ours and b) took less than 10 seconds to form, and carry it into the foreseeable future, not even considering the idea that there might be more we donâ€™t know.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s wrong with admitting that we donâ€™t know enough to judge a topic or event? Do we really think we have enough context and facts to make sound judgements on all our beliefs? Do we really need to hold an opinion after every scandal? Why canâ€™t we just say â€œThis is a side of a storyâ€� and move on?</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/timnit-gebru-google-fired/">Googleâ€™s firing of Timnit Gebru</a> for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I read a headline about Google firing a researcher that criticized the company on a mailing list. I didnâ€™t need about any more drama in my life, so I didnâ€™t read further, tucking this away in my mind as â€œresearcher fired from Googleâ€�.</li>
<li>Google responded with something along the lines of â€œshe was using an email list in such a way that was improper for her positionâ€�. I still didnâ€™t need the drama, so I kept it in my mind as â€œresearcher fired from Googleâ€�.</li>
<li>I still hold no strong positions on this specific topic and donâ€™t plan on learning more about it. Like in most â€œscandalsâ€�, thereâ€™s a lot of â€œhe said, she saidâ€� going on, and I donâ€™t need to spend time figuring out who is right.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I wanted to hold an opinion on this event, Iâ€™d need the following details to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code of conduct for Gebruâ€™s position</li>
<li>Other alternative methods Gebru could have used not in violation of the Code of Conduct if her actions violated it</li>
<li>The contents of the email</li>
<li>Verbose arguments from both sides refuting each otherâ€™s points if possible</li>
<li>Evidence of Gebruâ€™s claims</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who does not work at nor plans to work at Google, this just isnâ€™t worth my time, so I donâ€™t form an opinion. There are other things to worry about.</p>
<p>TL;DR (again): Either start learning about issues you care about, or stop caring about them so much. Itâ€™s more honest, less mental effort, and is less likely to ruin Thanksgiving.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><em>This post talks about <a href="https://www.eduflow.com/">Eduflow</a> and <a href="https://www.peergrade.io/">Peergrade</a> – our two main products.</em></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at two fairly similar scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and my card is declined</li>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and I fail the 3DSecure check</li>
</ul>

<p>As a programmer – I know what you’re saying – under the hood these two are of course very different.</p>

<p>But from the user’s perspective, they were trying to pay and they failed to do so: potato, <em>potato3DSecure</em>. Unfortunately, if you’re using Stripe, the outcome of these two failures are very different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I get a normal card decline, nothing happens. The user goes back to square one. No subscription, no nothing – as expected.</li>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I fail the 3DSecure verification – maybe I figured out that I didn’t want to buy anyways, once I saw that scary verification screen [1]. In this case, Stripe will have created the subscription and is basically expecting the user to pay for it within the next 23 hours. Basically, there’s a bunch of state, that both the user and the developer would expect to only have been created once the payment succeeded. (<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle">Stripe docs</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, that’s a leaky abstraction if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>In the olden days (for us that was Stripe Checkout Legacy along with Stripe Billing), the payment flow between a web app and Stripe would be this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Principally, this is still possible if you use the new Stripe Checkout. But if you have anything but the most vanilla of setups – that will not work for you: tiered pricing, per-seat pricing, and metered billing are not available in Stripe Checkout as of Jan 14th 2021. Like many other SAAS businesses, we use tiered per-seat pricing in Eduflow.</p>

<p>So we need to use Stripe Elements, build our own form, and write a ton of Javascript boilerplate that is probably 90-95% identical to what other users of Stripe Elements are writing.</p>

<p>The flow now looks roughly like this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this is the flow in the frontend. There has always been a bit of backend setup, but the amount of code and complexity there has roughly stayed the same when comparing with the old setup.</p>

<p>The extra added round-trip to Stripe here is related to 3DSecure. The idea is – if you after the first round-trip have a PaymentIntent with <code>status == "requires_action"</code> it means 3DSecure is required for the payment. You should then call <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> in the frontend which initiates the second round-trip to Stripe.</p>

<p>As far as I can see from <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action">the Stripe documentation</a> there is no other option than <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> when this happens, so why do I even have the choice to initiate it? If Stripe just called <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> itself we’d be back to good old happy-path:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app (but still with a lot of extra boilerplate)</p>

<p>Yes, initiating 3DSecure myself allows me to warn the user about it first. But as a European I’m getting 3DSecure everywhere these days (probably because we’ve just entered 2021) – with no warning beforehand – so I think it would make more sense for Stripe to allow developers to stay on the happy-path instead of defaulting to a more complicated special-case with no opt-out.</p>

<p>That was the original value proposition of Stripe. The frontend code we have in Peergrade is these <strong>23 lines of code</strong> and it does tiered, per-seat pricing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>StripeCheckout</span>
  <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Peergrade"</span>
  <span>description</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span>
  <span>amount</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>billedNow</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>}</span> <span>// amount is in cents</span>
  <span>email</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>email</span><span>}</span>
  <span>stripeKey</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>publicKey</span><span>}</span>
  <span>billingAddress</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>zipCode</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>token</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>({</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>createSubscription</span><span>({</span>
      <span>stripeToken</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>stripeEmail</span><span>:</span> <span>email</span><span>,</span>
      <span>planType</span><span>:</span> <span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>quantity</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span>
    <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"hidden"</span>
    <span>ref</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_input</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>StripeCheckout</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Granted, this uses <code>react-stripe-checkout</code>, but that’s just a very thin wrapper around <code>https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js</code>.</p>

<p>In Eduflow, because we’re forced to use Stripe Elements and it’s interweaved throughout our subscriptions page, with <code>&lt;CardNumberElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardExpiryElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardCvcElement&gt;</code>
and calls to <code>stripe.createPaymentMethod()</code> and <code>stripe.confirmCardPayment()</code>.</p>

<p>Technically we should do that in Peergrade as well due to PSD2, but for now we will just let those payments fail and ask the customers to switch to Eduflow. It’s too much hassle.</p>

<p>That old script – <code>checkout.js</code> – is really a one-line payment integration. Just include the script and you get the payment button! What happened Stripe?</p>

<p>I know what you’re gonna say – PSD2/SCA/3DSecure happened. Yes, it did. But Stripe already needed to ask the bank whether to allow the transaction (going through VISA/Mastercard and a bunch of other steps behind the scenes). Now Stripe also needs to ask the customer as well through something like 3DSecure. <code>checkout.js</code> already shows a modal with a form for inputting name, address and credit card, so they can just reuse that modal to let the user input the 3DSecure verification as well.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if you’re not creating a new subscription but rather upgrading an existing one you can use “<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates">Pending updates</a>” to not have the subscription update until the transaction is fully confirmed with 3DSecure and everything. Why isn’t that the default, and why isn’t it available when the subscription is initially created?</p>

<p>[1] Everybody, <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb-dk/guides/strong-customer-authentication">including Stripe</a>, expects 3DSecure to lower conversion rates, both because the extra step increases friction, but also because it will be unfamiliar and scary to some users. On a personal note, the first time I was asked to do 3DSecure probably 10 years ago or more, I declined. I never saw a 3DSecure prompt again until about 6 months ago. It just wasn’t something I had heard about, and so it seemed scary that I need to receive a text message in order to do a credit card purchase. Over time, I expect customers will get used to it and conversion rates will normalize.</p>

Card declines were already expected to be async in Stripe. The recommendation was to only provisioning whatever the user was paying for once your webhook was hit.

~~So here's my suggestion: The customer inputs their personal details and card details, and the web app sends that off to Stripe. Stripe checks with the bank whether the transaction is good to go. If the bank or some other security system replies "You need to do 3DSecure" – just do that – show the customer a spinner until the transaction (including 3DSecure) is finished. As a store/service/paid web app, I don't need to know about all that – it's part of the transaction.~~

              <p>Problems emerging from data are common in research as well as in the industry. Those problems are dealt with as part of our project, but we usually don't bother solving them at their origin. We fix the data locally once, and we go on with our project. This is certainly a valid method in some cases, but as we share data more and more between projects, we are finding ourselves repeating the same processes over time and across teams. This issue is particularly true for public datasets shared by many people to train many machine learning models. I will show you how to create, maintain, and contribute to a long-living dataset that will update itself automatically across projects, using git and DVC as versioning systems, and DAGsHub as a host for the datasets.</p><h2 id="changing-datasets-is-a-common-process">Changing datasets is a common process</h2><p>I remember that during my undergraduate studies, I had to generate an instance segmentation model for cucumber plant parts, using a custom dataset of segmented leaves, cucumbers, and flowers. At a very early stage, I discovered I couldn't get reasonable results with the data given initially. I decided I would fix the annotations myself on about a dozen pictures. As expected, this solved 80 percent of the issues I was having. This is a good opportunity to say that manual data labor is underrated. Investing a few hours in fixing the data was the best thing I could do for the project. Then, of course, I went on with my life, leaving the fixed dataset on the lab computer, but knowing that eventually, my fixes were going to vanish.</p><p>Naturally, this process was gradual. I started with the original dataset, then I fixed a part of the annotations. At some point, I added completely new pictures, decided to redo some of them. I iterated over the data with multiple manipulations over time. Many of them I treated as "Debug trial-and-errors", naturally not keeping track of my working directory rigorously. During those iterations, I ran training sessions, while doing my best to keep a detailed record of my "experience". If you are still reading, you probably understand exactly what I am talking about. Well, the world has changed since then, and many data versioning tools have evolved to help. This is a good opportunity to recommend this <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-version-control-tools/">comparison between data version control tools</a> we published at the end of 2020.</p><h2 id="what-is-data-versioning">What is data versioning?</h2><p>While my project was a total mess data-wise, its code was very well tracked by git. The reason is that I could just run the following magical commands that everyone knows:</p><pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "fixed training input directory"
</code></pre><p>Back then I wasn't able to do any magical command of that sort for my data. Now, with <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> and DAGsHub in the world, this is no longer the case. There is no reason on earth why you should not at least have a simple code and data versioning system set in place. If you are not familiar with DVC, I recommend you go through <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/">this basic data versioning tutorial</a>, but it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a prerequisite to understand the rest of this post. All you really need to know is that now we have a new, magical command:</p><pre><code>dvc commit
</code></pre><p>That will create a snapshot of the tracked data, without inflating your git repository.</p><p>While data versioning solves the problem of managing data in the context of your machine learning project, it brings with it a new approach to managing <strong>datasets</strong>. This approach, also described as data registries <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries">here</a>, consists of creating <strong>a git repository entirely dedicated to managing a dataset</strong>. This means that instead of training models on frozen datasets - something researchers, students, kagglers, and open source machine learning contributors often do - you could link your project to a dataset (or to any file for that matter), and treat it as a dependency. After all, <strong>data can and should be treated as code</strong>, and follow through a review process. You can read more about that in another post about <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-bugs-how-to-fix-them/">data bugs and how to fix them</a>.</p><p><strong>Warning - Don't continue reading if you feel threatened by knowledge!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc/giphy.gif"><p><small><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/arielle-m-star-trek-information-overload-3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc">via GIPHY</a></small></p></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I am joking, of course, this isn't going to be rocket science at all. In fact, I will demonstrate how to use such a living-dataset in a project similar to my university project.</p><h2 id="creating-a-data-registry-to-use-it-as-a-living-dataset">Creating a data registry to use it as a living-dataset</h2><p>In order to demonstrate this new concept of living-datasets, I have set one up myself, as well as a machine learning model using it as a dependency.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset">Repository A</a></strong> - AKA the living dataset, is going to be a simple project, with magical metadata files that point to real big files stored in a dedicated storage. I can organize the dataset files into directories, add code files with <code>utils</code> functions to work with it, or whatever I see fit to store and present my dataset to whoever might want to consume it.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentor">Repository B</a></strong> - AKA the machine learning project, is where I want to use the files stored in my living-dataset. This repository will import a directory from Repository A using DVC, and this will do the trick of having that directory manageable and updatable.</p><p>To create a data registry, just create a git + DVC directory.</p><pre><code>mkdir my-dataset &amp;&amp; cd my-dataset
git init
dvc init
</code></pre><p>Congrats! Your living-dataset is alive. Now we need to add some files to it.</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif"></figure><p>In my case, I took a handful of screenshots from a beloved TV Show, and annotated my favorite character in it, using the awesome open source <a href="https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator">COCO annotator project</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/annotator-demo2_1.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After annotating around 40 pictures, I knew it was going to be enough for a pre-trained Mask-RCNN with a ResNet50 backbone, to give decent results (15 would have probably been enough too, but it was too fun to stop). I exported a <code>.json</code> annotation file, put it in my repository along with the screenshots I took. At this point my working directory looked like this:</p><pre><code>.
├── annotations
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── grogu.json
└── images
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 000.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 001.png
    .
    .
    .
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 206.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; └── 208.png
</code></pre><p>Then I ran the magic commands to start tracking the data files.</p><pre><code>dvc add annotations
dvc add images
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Starting to manage my dataset"
</code></pre><p>Since I like visualizations I wrote a script in <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/Playground.ipynb">this python notebook</a> to render previews of my dataset into a <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/preview">preview directory</a>, which will also be tracked by DVC. Then I just push my code and data to my remote repository, so that I can access it from everywhere, and share it with my collaborators.</p><pre><code>git push origin master
dvc push -r origin
</code></pre><p>Note: I skipped the part of opening a repository on GitHub / DAGsHub and setting up the remote storage, <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/#pushing-code-data-and-models-to-dagshub">the tutorial</a> should cover that.</p><h2 id="using-a-living-dataset-in-a-machine-learning-project">Using a living-dataset in a machine learning project</h2><p>Now it is time to use my dataset as a dependency in my machine learning project. I will not be able to recreate my cucumber project from school, since I do not have access to the data, so I will substitute the cucumbers with the beloved fictional character from above.</p><p>I want my project directory to look like the following:</p><pre><code>.
├── data
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── preprocessed
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── raw
└── src
</code></pre><p>I want to import a directory from my dataset and treat it as <code>raw</code> files. I can do it by running from inside my repository:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p data/raw

dvc import -o data/raw/images \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/images

dvc import -o data/raw/annotations \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/annotations</code></pre><p>This will specifically download the directories <code>images</code> and <code>annotations</code> from inside my dataset repository, and keep information on how to continue tracking the changes made in it. More on tracking the changes will be explained later, but this is pretty much it.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 921w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the chart above you can see a representation of how it works. The arrows go in the direction of dependencies. Every time I know the dataset has changed, I just run the command</p><pre><code>dvc update
</code></pre><p>The <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/update">command above</a> will check for changes in the tracked ref of the repository, and pull them to my local directories. Then I re-run my pipeline from scratch - Train my model, save the best one, and commit my results. Notice that we can use this method of <code>dvc import</code> + <code>dvc update</code> to get the output model as a dependency in another project if we wanted to.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for reading along, I hope you enjoyed it. The project is still a work in progress (but what project isn't?). So if you find mistakes, or improvements to make, either in the dataset or the model, then just contribute to them! It's fairly easy to fork repositories, pull the data, push it, and merge it. Especially with <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/">data-science pull requests</a>. The process can easily be adapted to any segmentation dataset, so feel free to do so as well.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asher-yartsev/">Asher</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or-shemesh-4a99a7101/">Or</a>, my fellow students from the original segmentation project that gave me inspiration for this mini-project.</p><p>Here are some results just for fun!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/grogus.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<p>For the last two years, Mala Jadwani, a 31-year-old teacher, has received daily messages from her 60-year-old <em>chachi</em>. On their family WhatsApp group, her aunt, who started using a smartphone a few years ago, posts classic older-relative content: garden-variety motivational quotes, prayer emojis, home remedies for body aches, and “good morning,” “good afternoon,” and “good evening” greetings accompanied by pictures of babies and roses. On days when her chachi’s messages were particularly prolific, Jadwani’s phone would freeze, forcing her to disable WhatsApp’s automatic photo download setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But last week, her chachi’s<em> </em>WhatsApp messages suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worried, Jadwani called her aunt. It turned out that she had read a chain of viral messages on WhatsApp, which falsely said the platform’s messaging system was no longer private. She was one of millions of users who received a push notification from WhatsApp earlier this month, explaining that the company was updating its privacy policy, mostly in superficial ways. After February 8, 2021, “you’ll need to accept these changes to continue using WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/whatsapp_new_privacy_policy_facebook-news-47077.php">the update read</a>. The thought of her WhatsApp messages being exposed frightened Jadwani’s aunt so much, she said, that she stopped sending messages on WhatsApp altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is WhatsApp’s largest consumer market by many measures, but backlash against the recent privacy policy change is now threatening its future in the country. Many people have debated the update with their friends and family, and it’s also been featured in nightly news shows and on the front page of local newspapers. Last week, Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, took <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90593913/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-outrage-newspaper-ads">out full-page advertisements</a> and plugged interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/digbijaymishra1/status/1349562056429641735?s=20">with the heads of WhatsApp</a> in newspapers, in an effort to mitigate the fallout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change isn’t actually a departure from how WhatsApp has treated user data for years. The platform has shared metadata — phone numbers, how often the app is opened, and operating system information —&nbsp;with Facebook since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/whatsapp-privacy-facebook/">2016</a>. The pop-up notification millions of users received on January 8 sought explicit permission to continue these existing practices. But unlike four years ago, “there was no opt-out option to refuse sharing information with Facebook companies,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>



<p>The new changes are related to how businesses communicate with WhatsApp users. The update made it clearer that commercial activity on the messaging platform has the potential to spill over into other Facebook apps: “a handbag you browse on WhatsApp could pop up later in your Instagram app,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/whatsapp-data.html">explained</a>. Over <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660772483104769?s=20">175 million</a> people already message companies on WhatsApp, and the updated terms of service would make it “easier to chat with businesses who may use Facebook business products,” <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/about-new-business-features-and-whatsapps-privacy-policy-update">reads a blog post</a> from WhatsApp’s communications team. The post claims that the update would enable customer service features like purchase receipts.</p>



<p>The confusing change triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/signals-downloads-skyrocketed-4200-after-whatsapp-announced-it-would-force-users-to-share-personal-data-with-facebook/articleshow/80232029.cms">mass exodus</a> of WhatsApp users, who moved to other messaging platforms like Signal and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">Telegram</a>. After the disastrous rollout, Facebook later announced it was delaying updating its privacy policy by three months, but for loyal WhatsApp users, the damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook’s privacy practices and <a href="https://thewire.in/business/facebook-is-misleading-indians-with-its-full-page-ads-about-free-basics">policy decisions</a> in India have long been criticized. What’s different this time are the demographics of the people who are outraged: uncles and aunties. For the first time, India’s most loyal and engaged users are questioning the intentions of an app that has grown to encompass nearly every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are an indispensable part of South Asian families: they’re a forum for gossip, dodgy forwarded messages, boisterous political debates, and generally the primary way for relatives to stay in touch. Many of these WhatsApp family groups — including my own — erupted with anger and confusion in the days after the platform sent the pop-up message announcing its new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheshadri Narayanane, a friend from high school, is a part of two family groups. He said his 70-year-old aunt falsely believed WhatsApp had been granted access to her bank accounts. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">WhatsApp recently launched payments</a> in India, allowing users to send and receive money by connecting their bank accounts to the messaging app. The privacy update came shortly after WhatsApp Pay was launched, which might have caused some of the confusion. “Bad timing is my theory,” Narayanane speculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On prime-time talk shows, news hosts likened the update to <em>digital dadagiri</em>, or “digital bullying,” by WhatsApp. “They want to sell your chats — your data from WhatsApp private chats — to business enterprises,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0F5T1Q0z5Y">declared</a> one news anchor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debates often took on a political tone. Some TV hosts asked questions about the government’s ability to protect India’s sovereignty. Gaurav Bhatia, the national spokesperson of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">weighed in</a>, saying his party would go to any lengths necessary to protect the privacy of its citizens. On January 19, the Ministry of Electronics and Communication Technology (MeitY) sent a request to Facebook to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/govt-tells-whatsapp-to-respect-privacy-of-indians-withdraw-new-policy/articleshow/80344964.cms?from=mdr">withdraw the new changes made to its privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why is it that these social media giants, who need the India market, are having two different policies for different countries?” Bhatia said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">nightly news show,</a> referencing the fact that WhatsApp’s policy update <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake">does not apply to the European Union</a>. Some accused WhatsApp of treating Indians as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18of5M6g2M&amp;t=1625s">second-rate citizens</a>.” Local technology entrepreneurs who compete with Big Tech companies like Facebook soon <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayshekhar/status/1349186007007023104?s=20">piled on</a>.</p>



<p>Facebook has repeatedly emphasized that WhatsApp can’t see the content of end-to-end encrypted messages, which can be viewed by only the sender and receiver. Alternatives like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/01/11/whatsapp-telegram-signal-privacy-security-comparison/">Telegram don’t necessarily offer</a> the same protections as WhatsApp. Digital liberties activists and advocacy groups like IFF <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?s=20">recommend</a> using Signal instead for sensitive communications, and the app quickly became the number one downloaded app in India earlier this month. Signal commemorated its victory on Twitter. “Look at what you’ve done,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347693761044701186?s=20">tweet</a> from the app’s official account, accompanied by an emoji of the Indian flag.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though users are downloading Signal and other encrypted alternatives in high numbers, switching might not be as simple for aunties and uncles who spent years becoming proficient in using WhatsApp. Vivek K, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur, tried making the case to his mother that she should switch over to Signal and was met with an unenthusiastic response: “She said, ‘Now, you’re making me learn one more app? I can’t do it; I’m too old for this<em>,</em>’” explained Vivek.</p>



<p>For now, with the privacy update postponed until at least May, WhatsApp is working to mitigate the backlash. But people like Jadwani’s chachi are still staying away from the messaging app. Jadwani said she hasn’t missed the lack of daily greetings. “No wonder my phone hasn’t had issues,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:

That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--

If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is a great platform to deploy our microservices and applications to. One of the excellent features is that pods are restarted or removed from a service when they don’t work correctly. Kubernetes needs our help to understand if a pod is working or not. This is configured via Container Probes.</p>

<p>Any application can be in an unhealthy state due to bugs, missing dependencies on external resources, and so on. To make sure our traffic flows correctly, we need to make sure probes are configured.</p>

<h2 id="probes"><a href="#probes">#</a>Probes</h2>

<p>Probes are kubelet’s answer to the health checks, there are three handlers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#execaction-v1-core">ExecAction</a></strong>: Command execution check, if the command’s exit status is 0, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>TCPSocketAction</strong>: TCP check to determine if the port is open, if open, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPGetAction</strong>: HTTP check to determine if the status code is equal to or above 200 and below 400.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each type of probe has common configurable fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>initialDelaySeconds</strong>: Probes start running after <code>initialDelaySeconds</code> after container is started (default: 0)</li>
<li><strong>periodSeconds</strong>: How often probe should run (default: 10)</li>
<li><strong>timeoutSeconds</strong>: Probe timeout (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>successThreshold</strong>: Required number of successful probes to mark container healthy/ready (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>failureThreshold</strong>: When a probe fails, it will try <code>failureThreshold</code> times before deeming unhealthy/not ready (default: 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>These parameters need to be configured per your application’s spec.</p>

<h3 id="exec-probe"><a href="#exec-probe">#</a>Exec Probe</h3>

<p>Exec action has only one field, and that is <code>command.</code> Exit status of the command is checked, and the status of zero (0) means it is healthy, and other value means it is unhealthy.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          exec:
            command:
            - cat
            - /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tcp-probe"><a href="#tcp-probe">#</a>TCP Probe</h3>

<p>We need to define <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> parameters, <code>host</code> parameter defaults to the cluster-internal pod IP.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          tcpSocket:
            host:
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<h3 id="http-probe"><a href="#http-probe">#</a>HTTP Probe</h3>

<p>HTTP Probe has additional options to configure.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>host</strong>: Host/IP to connect to (default: pod IP)</li>
<li><strong>scheme</strong>: Scheme to use when making the request (default: HTTP)</li>
<li><strong>path</strong>: Path</li>
<li><strong>httpHeaders</strong>: An array of headers defined as header/value map</li>
<li><strong>port</strong>: Port to connect to</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you need to set the Host header of the HTTP, please do so on httpHeaders, instead of the host parameter.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 2
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            host:
            scheme: HTTP
            path: /
            httpHeaders:
            - name: Host
              value: myapplication1.com
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre>

<h2 id="readiness-probes-in-kubernetes"><a href="#readiness-probes-in-kubernetes">#</a>Readiness Probes in Kubernetes</h2>

<p>Kubernetes runs readiness probes to understand when it can send traffic to a pod, i.e., to transition the pod to <code>Ready</code> state. For example, if a pod is used as a backend endpoint for a service, a readiness probe will determine if the pod will receive traffic or not. The readiness probe is executed throughout the pod’s lifetime; this means that readiness probes continue to be executed after reaching the <code>Ready</code> state. Also, our application can make itself unavailable for maintenance or for some background tasks as well by responding with different values to the probe.</p>

<p>A pod transitions the following states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PodScheduled</strong>: Pod is scheduled on an available node</li>
<li><strong>ContainersReady</strong>: All containers in <code>Ready</code> state</li>
<li><strong>Initialized</strong>: All init containers are started</li>
<li><strong>Ready</strong>: Pod is ready to receive traffic (readiness probe)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes"><a href="#common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes">#</a>Common Pitfalls for Readiness Probes</h2>

<p>Readiness probes check the configured action for the duration of the container’s lifetime; therefore, any disruption or delay in answering can cause service disruption. Sometimes the application needs to read a large amount of data experiencing latency issues or make an expensive calculation, which might prevent such an answer from being delivered. This behavior should be considered when configuring readiness probes. Testing thoroughly before going live with a readiness probe is highly recommended.</p>

<h3 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures">#</a>Cascading Failures</h3>

<p>Consider this, we have configured a readiness probe with HTTPGet, and our application checks the database connection before answering the probe. Let’s suggest there is a database problem; in this case, all pods will be unreachable unless the database is back. Do we want this behavior? Certainly no, we could feed the database error to the front end and notify the user of the unavailability; even if we increase <code>failureThreshold</code> we might not be able to avoid a cascading failure. Avoiding external dependencies on readiness probe answers is what I would recommend in any case.</p>

<h3 id="external-dependencies"><a href="#external-dependencies">#</a>External Dependencies</h3>

<p>Let’s assume that you have a key/value store used for caching, and your readiness probe endpoint checks this connection as well. The application is capable of running without the key/value store as it will only slow down but it will run a full database query every time it needs to access data. In this case, if the readiness probe fails because of the key/value store not being available, your whole application will be down for some time -until you fix the key/value store which is certainly not desirable.</p>

<p>You need to clearly design your probes considering how your application behaves and how the application responds when there is a failure. You might want to restart the pod (via liveness checks) or remove it from service with a readiness probe.</p>

<h2 id="example-sample-nginx-deployment"><a href="#example-sample-nginx-deployment">#</a>Example: Sample Nginx Deployment</h2>

<p>To see readiness probes in action, we can configure a sample app, a simple NGINX web server in this case. Here we have defined a simple deployment configuration:</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: k8s-probes
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 2
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            host:
            scheme: HTTP
            path: /
            httpHeaders:
            - name: Host
              value: myapplication1.com
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-deployment.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-deployment.yaml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - name: nginx-http-port
    port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-svc.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-svc.yaml</code>.</p>

<p>There is no separate endpoint for readiness probes, but we can access events using the <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command, for example, to get the current status.</p>

<p>Use <code>kubectl get pods</code> command to see the pods’ status.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>Pods and their status and ready states will be displayed, our pod is running as expected.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   1/1     Running   0          1m23s
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw
</code></pre>

<p>At the bottom of the output <code>Events</code> will be displayed:</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------

  Normal  Started    15m   kubelet            Started container nginx
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s look at the endpoints with <code>kubectl get endpoints</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get endpoints
</code></pre>

<p>We can see Nginx service has an endpoint.</p>

<pre><code>NAME         ENDPOINTS           AGE
kubernetes   10.132.0.42:16443   8h
nginx        10.1.85.203:80      6m11s
</code></pre>

<p>To see more detail we can use <code>kubectl describe endpoints nginx</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>Name:         nginx
Namespace:    default
Labels:       app=nginx
Annotations:  endpoints.kubernetes.io/last-change-trigger-time: 2020-11-13T20:34:13Z
Subsets:
  Addresses:          10.1.85.203
  NotReadyAddresses:  &lt;none&gt;
  Ports:
    Name             Port  Protocol
    ----             ----  --------
    nginx-http-port  80    TCP
</code></pre>

<p>Configure the readiness probe’s <code>port</code> parameter to 81 and apply the configuration.</p>

<p>Again let’s check the pods status</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>As we have updated our deployment by default, a new pod is created, and as you can see, it is not in the ready state.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw   1/1     Running   0          13m
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   0/1     Running   0          2m49s
</code></pre>

<p>Here status is running however <code>READY</code> state determines our pod is not ready yet. Let’s explore the status and events with <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that the readiness probe failed due to the connection being refused therefore pod will not receive any traffic.</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                From               Message

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Once or twice a year I’ll go through a phase of extreme delegation to cope with the demands of startup life. I make long lists of my worries </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> responsibilities, systems, activities, even relationships </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> and ruthlessly brainstorm how to hand them off to someone else. Channeling Marie Kondo, I insist that I don’t have to do anything that doesn’t bring me joy. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, and my master plan of delegation fails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still, delegation is crucial to </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/to-be-a-great-leader-you-have-to-learn-how-to-delegate-well"><span>managing well</span></a><span>. If I can’t get off of the hamster wheel of doing, I may miss the big picture. Here are the mistakes I’m trying not to repeat.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Delaying delegation too long</strong></h5>
<p><span>My responsibility purge is usually triggered by </span><a href="https://blog.prialto.com/i-know-i-should-be-delegating-to-save-me-time-but-i-am-just-too-busy-to-figure-it-out"><span>extreme overwhelm</span></a><span>. If I’m not careful, I will listen to the overwhelm telling me that delegating will be more work than doing the work myself. That may initially be true, but it will also mean that I can never get out from under my own task list to see better ways to do something or to grow. To determine whether a task may be a good handoff candidate, I’m asking the following:</span><i></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task consume a disproportionate amount of energy</span></i><span>? Every Thursday, I need to duplicate and distribute a team presentation. It seems too insignificant to put on my to-do list every week, so I rely on myself to remember it unprompted each Thursday afternoon. I could put a calendar reminder for it, but then someone will schedule a meeting during that time, and I’ll miss the reminder. I clearly spend too much energy thinking about this and need to hand it off.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Do I actively dread the task? </span></i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/12/ill-do-it-later/578173/"><span>Laundry is my nemesis</span></a><span>, and I will strategically plan outfits to avoid doing it for as long as possible. It wasn’t until Dan suggested having someone else do it that I first glimpsed freedom. In fact, that someone else may even do a better job and get joy from it. I waited so long to consider delegating this one that I almost forgot that escape is possible.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task specifically require my voice, face, writing, or knowledge? </span></i><span>Some days at an early stage company can feel like everything is waiting on me. Truthfully, very few tasks probably do, but that’s not what my ego wants to hear. Vacation days are a great reminder that the company </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> survive without me. When I start to dread a day off, I know that I’m handling too much.</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Handing off the wrong tasks</strong></h5>
<p><span>In a typical week, I check out five or so books from the library. When I first hired an assistant, I created an elaborate system for them to log into my accounts, pull books from my reading list, and send them to my Kindle or local library branch. My goal was an endless stream of interesting reading. The result was far from that.</span></p>
<p><span>I became overwhelmed by the pressure to read and unhappy with the mix of books being selected (even though they were pre-selected by me!). Reading became a chore rather than a relaxing pastime. I realized that I craved books related to the events of the week, and I missed perusing the shelves myself. I had handed off something I loved for the sake of creating more time to do the things I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Startups pull us in multiple directions, and it can be hard to remember what we love about our jobs. Be clear about why you’re delegating and </span><a href="https://marissabracke.com/dont-delegate-what-you-love-doing-delegate-what-supports-you-doing-it"><span>hold on to the activities that bring you joy</span></a><span>. A shorter to-do list is only wonderful if the remaining items don’t make you want to quit your job.</span></p>

<h5><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/04/30/delegate-outcomes-not-activities/"><span><strong>Dictating process rather than outcome</strong></span></a></h5>
<p><span>Another hard concept for my ego to grasp: my way isn’t the only way. So I let my assistant set up appointments for me however she deemed fit. When I looked back through my sent mail, I noticed that she had started each of her emails with “Good day to you.” Not what I would have said, but she still achieved the outcome.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://swipesapp.com/blog/delegation-and-trust-team-productivity"><span>Delegation requires trust</span></a><span>, and trust is earned. Start off with small outcomes and work towards higher stake assignments. You’ve made hires for a reason, so use their brainpower and past experience to figure out the “how” for themselves. Letting someone else think through a process and execute on it means the method may be different from mine, and we both end up learning something.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Put in the time to delegate the right tasks to the right people before you become overwhelmed. Then they can write articles like this for you. (Or so says my delegation fantasy.)</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p>nginx + cgit + gitolite = $5/month</p><p> published:&nbsp; <time datetime="2021-01-12T00:00:00+00:00"> 12 January 2021 </time></p></header><p>I've been on a <em>"own my online presence"</em> kick for more than a year now. So for this (overly protracted) essay, I thought I'd publish my notes on how I created my own Git server.</p><p>There are many open source projects like <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">GitTea</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> to make hosting your own git projects effortless; however I wanted a much more simple (read: old school) setup. I ended up with something that uses many of the same projects that the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux Organization</a> uses to publish the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">Linux Kernel</a></p><p>The server (as of this writing) uses <a href="http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu's 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa)</a> running on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean's</a> hardware (<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f6f650ad4e">referral-link</a>). I wholeheartedly support and recommend you chose a different setup. Diversity in people and in tech stack is always and will always be a great thing.</p><p>What lies below can be broken into 3 main topics:</p><ol><li><a href="#the-start">The Start</a> prepares a newly minted server for git hosting duties. Creating a new admin user, locking down the OpenSSH daemon, and installing fail2ban.</li><li><a href="#gitolite">Gitolite</a> installs and configures the server to allow us (and colleagues) to have more fine-grained control over who has access to <code>git push|fetch</code> on the server.</li><li>And <a href="#cgit">Cgit</a>, <a href="#fastcgi-wrapper">fcgiwrap</a>, and <a href="#nginx">Nginx</a> to create a web-server to view our published projects.</li></ol><div><p>In the end, you'll have a server much like <a href="https://git.bryanbrattlof.com/">this one</a>.</p><p><em>Enjoy!</em></p></div><div id="the-start"><h2>The Start</h2><p>I often find security <em>"best practices"</em> are a lot like driving down the highway. Some people speeding past you are <em>"obviously"</em> just moments away from a major data breach, while the others you're passing are <em>"clearly"</em> so worried about the entire data-center burning down, they couldn't possibly get anything else done. Everyone thinks everyone else has lost their marbles.</p><p>So with that in mind, here are a few steps I took to secure my newly minted server. Please feel free to use only the <em>"best practices"</em> you deem appropriate for your mission.</p><p>Or just <a href="#gitolite">skip to the "installing Gitolite"</a> part directly.</p><div id="admin-user"><h3>Admin User</h3><p>For whatever reason, be it for security or protecting the server from my stupidity, one of the first things I do when creating a new server is add a new user for my general admin tasks.</p><p>Adding a new user is remarkably easy to do on a Ubuntu system:</p><p>You'll be prompted to answer a few questions, including creating a new UNIX password. This will be the password you'll need to <code>sudo -i</code> and gain <code>root</code> permissions, so make it a good one, or use tools like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a>, or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> to help you remember.</p><p>Then give our new <code>limb</code> user <code>sudo</code> permissions:</p><p>I've also largely eliminated all password based authentication when signing into servers, relying on open source smart cards like <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">NitroKey</a> for authentication. If interested, this requires we setup <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> for our <code>limb</code> user:</p><p>Just replace <code>key</code> with your public ssh key:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mkdir /home/limb/.ssh
$ echo "key" &gt; /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>Next, set the <code>.ssh</code> directory's file permissions so the <code>ssh</code> daemon can read the files:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ chown -R limb:limb /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 700 /home/limb/.ssh
$ chmod 644 /home/limb/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></div><p>If everything worked, after you restart the <code>ssh</code> daemon (<code>service sshd restart</code>) you will now be able to login as the administrator user:</p></div><div id="openssh"><h3>OpenSSH</h3><p>Git and Gitolite (<a href="#gitolite">installed in the next sections</a>) will need us to keep port 22 open, allowing us to <code>git push</code> from anywhere on the internet. This open port will eventually attract <em>"a lot"</em> of attention from bots who endlessly scour the internet looking for vulnerable servers, mindlessly stuffing passwords, hoping one password will eventually let them in.</p><p>We can eliminate all worry about weak or compromised passwords by disabling all password based authentication, relying solely on <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/">asymmetric cryptography</a>, or <em>"ssh keys"</em>. Just use your favorite text editor to open <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and ensure these lines exist somewhere in it:</p><div><pre><span></span>PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
</pre></div><p>While we're here, a large majority <a href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> of these bots are interested in logging in as the <code>root</code> user. If you created a new admin account in <a href="#admin-user">the previous section</a> and ensured you can login using your public key, you can also disable <code>root</code> logins entirely with this line in the config:</p><table id="id2"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Some simple <em>"bash-fu"</em> on my <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> shows ~93.58% of the roughly 15,000 login attempts since I started this server, tried to login as <code>root</code> Second place was the user <code>git</code> (including legitimate logins) at ~1.82%.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you uploaded your public key to your VPS provider, most of these changes should have already been configured for you. But in the off chance you had to make some changes, restart the <code>ssh</code> service to load the new config changes in:</p></div><div id="uncomplicated-firewall"><h3>Uncomplicated FireWall</h3><p>Depending on your VPS provider, they may also have a firewall system built into their admin panel allowing you to apply rules simply by adding tags to a server. However, I enjoy keeping all my firewall rules inside each box, if only for the same reason I <em>keep all my socks on the left hand drawer,</em> so everything stays organized and in the same place.</p><p>You can install <code>ufw</code> using the Advanced Packaging Tool:</p><p>Right now, the only thing we have enabled is <code>ssh</code> which uses port 22. To allow port 22 through <code>ufw</code> just use the following command:</p><p>and then turn the firewall on:</p><p>and <strong>viola!</strong> You have a firewall.</p></div><div id="fail2ban"><h3>fail2ban</h3><p>Even though we've turned off password based authentication <a href="#openssh">in a previous section</a>, we will still receive a significant amount of bots wasting our compute cycles trying to login. And while the likelihood of this being successful is <em>zero</em> when rounded to any order of magnitude, the bots will nevertheless continue to pilfer a non-zero amount of CPU if given the opportunity.</p><p>To stop the most brazen of these bots, tools like <a href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban">Fail2Ban</a>, which creates temporary firewall rules to block IP address who repeatedly fail to authenticate with <code>ssh</code>, are a great compromise between usefulness and annoyance.</p><p>The Advanced Packaging Tool can again help us install <code>fail2ban</code>.</p><p>Once installed, the <code>ssh</code> "jail" will come pre-enabled for you. If you wish to make any changes, you will need to make a copy of the <code>fail2ban</code> config file:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
</pre></div><p>Then add your changes to <code>jail.local</code> so they will persist after an upgrade.</p><p><code>fail2ban</code> does a great job documenting what each option does in the config file. Some of the changes I made are:</p><ul><li>because I use <code>ufw</code> to manage my firewall, I changed <code>banaction = ufw</code>.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.increment</code> to increase the duration of a ban based on how many times the IP address has been banned previously.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.rndtime</code> to <em>"randomize"</em> the length of a ban, preventing bots from knowing exactly when they can resume their assault.</li><li>enabled <code>bantime.maxtime</code> so I won't need to unban IP addresses (if you're unfortunate enough to share an IP with a bot).</li><li>lowered <code>bantime</code>, <code>findtime</code> and <code>maxretry</code> allowing me to issue small bans that increase in severity as the IP address continues to antagonize.</li></ul><p>Once you're satisfied with your changes, start <code>fail2ban</code> using <code>systemd</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ systemctl enable fail2ban
$ systemctl start fail2ban
</pre></div><p>And <strong>Done!</strong></p><p>Depending on how <em>"popular"</em> you are on the internet, you should start to see <code>NOTICE</code> lines in <code>/var/log/fail2ban.log</code> of misbehaving bots and the equivalent firewall rules in <code>ufw</code>.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ cat /var/log/fail2ban.log | grep 'NOTICE' | tail -1

Once installed, Gitolite will give us more fine-grained-control over who has <code>git push|fetch</code> permissions to each repository. I encourage you to checkout <a href="https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin.html">Gitolite's amazing documentation</a> if only to see how capable Gitolite can be.</p><div id="step-1-create-the-git-user"><h3>Step: 1 - Create The Git User</h3><p>Before we install Gitolite, we'll need to create a new user for everyone to log into and to run Gitolite's Perl scripts. I typically use the username <code>git</code> for this, feel free to replace <code>git</code> with the username that you feel is more appropriate.</p><div><pre><span></span>$ adduser --system --group --disabled-password --home /var/lib/git git
</pre></div><p>This creates a new system-user on the server called <code>git</code>.

This is where we will eventually put Gitolite's configuration files and our Git repositories. Feel free to adjust this to where you prefer, I've seen many use <code>/home/git</code>.</p><p>I included the <code>--disabled-password</code> to disable any password based access into our new user. In <a href="#openssh">the previous sections</a>, we've disabled all password based authentication into the server and Gitolite requires ssh keys for authentication, so disabling passwords for our user is a smart move.</p></div><div id="step-2-install-gitolite"><h3>Step: 2 - Install Gitolite</h3><p>Because Gitolite is just a bunch of Perl scripts, I prefer to install Gitolite from <a href="https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">the source</a>. As we will see, installing Gitolite from source also has the benefit of making upgrades and adding custom patches in the future extremely easy.</p><p>This also means we'll need to install Gitolite's dependencies ourselves:</p><p>When we (or a colleague) signs into the server, using the <code>git</code> user, we will automatically run Gitolite's Perl scripts, which means these scripts must be executable by our <code>git</code> user. So, to make managing file permissions easier, we'll use our <code>git</code> user for the rest of the installation process.</p><p>Log into our <code>git</code> user with the "substitute user" command: (assuming you're the <code>root</code> user)</p><p>Then clone Gitolite's source code into the <code>$HOME</code> directory: (this should be <code>/var/lib/git</code> unless <a href="#step-1-create-the-git-user">you changed it</a> when we setup the <code>git</code> user above)</p><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite

<p><strong><span>The Short Answer: Tanks all day.</span></strong></p>



<p>We needed to replace our aging hot water tank in 2020, so I discussed the tankless option with several plumbing professionals and homeowners.  Over the last few years, I have experienced the transition from tank to tankless at my in-laws home. We confidently decided the tank was better.</p>



<h2>Functional</h2>



<p>Tankless solves a problem we don’t have (unlimited hot water) and creates two new problems: </p>



<p>1) <strong>Slightly longer delay in getting hot water</strong> at the taps, esp. remote taps.  This is annoying, but further it’s a waste of clean water.  On some small scale it increases your water cost because you’re just running it down the drain while you wait for warmer water.  </p>



<p>2) <strong>More prone to hot water “dips”</strong>.  If you’re in the shower and someone uses water elsewhere in the house, hot water disappears for a few seconds.  This is due to some sort of pressure regulation issue I suppose.  This behavior was part of life when I lived in dorms and cheap apartments, but I have no patience for it now.  According to plumbing pros this can be mitigated with additional tech but now you’re just spending more $$ to solve a previously nonexistent problem.</p>



<h2>Financial</h2>



<p>If the costs were comparable I might devote more energy to considering tankless, but a replacing a tank with tankless system will 2x or 3x your project cost around here.</p>



<p>Most of the people I talked to who had installed tankless were happy with it, but nobody could provide a solid financial argument.  The “cost savings over time” argument originates with tankless manufacturers and plumbing companies.  </p>



<p>After purchase, the operating costs of a tankless system are a bit less per year.  In my view, these savings are nominal and it would take 15+ years to make up the difference in the purchase price, assuming no additional maintenance is needed.  How long do you think a tankless system will last, without fiddling?</p>



<p>Everyone who was happy with their tankess system either repeated the “pays for itself” line without any kind of cost-per-year numbers, or admitted that they didn’t really worry about the costs involved. Some people like the idea of a tankless system, or enjoy having new and innovative technology in their homes. This is fine, too.</p>



<p>Our reputable brand 50-gallon tank was installed by a trustworthy company for $1,173.  As of this writing, we have 8 months of pandemic-at-home heavy use by our family of four.  No problems, and no regrets.    <br></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life — think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success…</em></p>

<p>In this quote, Swami Vivekananda tells us that the way to success is total immersion in a single idea – leaving all other ideas alone.</p>
<p>Why does he tell us this? How does immersion in a single idea lead us to success? In this note, we attempt to find answers to these questions.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, ideas are usually construed as mental representational images of some object. Ideas can also be abstract concepts that do not present as mental images. Ideas can also represent some methods or approaches (leading to innovations) or some formulations of thought (leading to some new arguments or theories).</p>
<p>If one were to abstract from these numerous definitions of ‘idea’, one could legitimately describe an idea as a well-defined “space of thought”.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda says that the way to success is to plunge into a ‘space of thought’ – either a theory or frame, an innovation, a concept, or object – often connected with a mental representation – either clear or vague, in our minds.</p>

<p><em>What happens when we plunge in (dive deep) into a space of thought?</em></p>
<p>We encounter a hierarchy of consequences that we can describe in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought.png" alt="" width="700" height="472" srcset="https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought.png 700w, https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p><em><strong>Stage 1: Appreciation</strong></em><br>
<em>The first consequence we encounter when we plunge into an idea is that we begin to appreciate or discover the idea.</em> The more we think about the idea, the more we see the linkages of that idea to the world at large – we discover its potential value, and encounter its many possibilities of manifestation. We also discover the potential for economic, social, and other forms of value in the world.</p>
<p>Thus, we build conviction that the idea is valuable, and is worth pursuing in our lives.</p>
<p>We also see the value of the idea to ourselves personally. We begin to discover potential pathways to make that idea a reality. And we begin to see that the idea has the power to significantly impact our own and other people’s lives.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 2: Engagement</strong></em><br>
This conviction awakens in us the energy, the passion, to go deeper into the space of thought. Now the goal is not to discover the value and possibilities associated with the idea but to formulate a more vivid mental representation – a vision of what we are seeking.</p>
<p>This process or journey of visioning is joyful and creative. It may be an individual, personal process of visioning. It may also be a collective, co-created process of visioning. It may also be a process where we may want to test out and formulate various components of the vision and let the overall vision form itself as a result.</p>
<p>This visioning is not just a cognitive process, but a process involving energy, thought, the struggle with our own and others’ mental barriers, accompanied by sparks of discovery, innovation, and understanding.</p>
<p>It is thus, a process that is hardly smooth, but it is joyful, involving and creative.</p>
<p><em>As we engage deeply with the idea, what we get is not a mere representation or image of an idea, but a rigorous appreciation of what it means to live the idea. This difference is central to the whole process of ‘diving deep’ into an idea.</em></p>
<p>At this stage, the idea has moved from being an impersonal thought or concept, however valuable, to becoming a proposition to us, personally, on how to live or do things differently from how we act today.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 3: Practice</strong></em><br>
This personalization or individualization of the idea is what draws out of me, “commitment” and the “will to succeed”.</p>
<p>It is this ‘will to succeed’ that powers us and helps transform the ‘vision’ that we have, into real world products and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>this ‘will to succeed’ is accompanied by the practice of all that it takes to realize the vision.</em></p>
<p>This integrated, and yet one pointed practice, leads to the development of all the necessary capabilities and components of success.</p>
<p>We become ‘success worthy’.</p>
<p>At this stage, as individual components of the overall vision or story come into being, we become ready to encounter the next stage – a larger synthesis.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 4: Realization</strong></em><br>
As the successes build up, as the components or elements of the overall idea start taking shape and are (i) accepted by oneself as consistent with the vision; and (ii) accepted by the world as valuable; our attention moves to an overall synthesis – as we test the totality of what we have accomplished with the totality of the idea that we have immersed ourselves in.</p>
<p><em>By this time, the idea as an objective entity may be mere words that we express, but the idea as a subjective entity has led to a total transformation of ourselves.</em></p>
<p>We see that the idea is no longer a mere vision but has transformed into a ‘living ideal’ – a mode of living.</p>
<p>We are one with the idea subjectively, and we are close to building the objective manifestation of the idea in the real world.</p>
<p>Our very words carry the living conviction that the idea is real leading to an intuitive recognition in the world that we embody the idea in ourselves, and that we are living/ playing out the possibilities and the value creation – both for ourselves and the world – inherent in the idea.</p>
<p>We have realized the idea. Realized its value. And realized its many possibilities.</p>
<p>Success is the product/ side-effect of the realization of this idea in our lives.</p>

    </span></p><p>Can marketing be ethical? Or is marketing nothing but a sharp-elbowed race for business growth?</p><p>I truly think it can be. In moral terms, healthy commercial competition needn’t mean a race to the bottom. And I find it sad that I should even have to say that. But I do.</p><p>So I’ve written a manifesto for ethical marketing practices. It started as something I wrote purely for my own benefit, to keep myself honest. But now I’m thinking – why not share it with the world? It’s the kind of manifesto I would have liked to read at the start of my career, and if others find it useful, then great.</p><p>I’m keen to point out that it’s not one of <a href="https://www.kimmok.com/the-manifesto-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">those manifestos</a>. What I mean is, it’s not style over substance. It’s very much about the substance and values behind today’s marketing practices, and how we can do things better.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-glorify-growth-hacks">Why Do We Glorify Growth Hacks?</h3><p>It’s not so much that growth hacks are a problem per se. There’s nothing wrong with spotting new opportunities that make good use of data or customer behaviour and add a bit of technology to get the best possible outcome.  </p><p>But bad practices lurk in the most honourable of professions, and there’s a world of difference between a legal and ethical growth hack and scraping third-party websites for user data, or otherwise breaking the terms and conditions of those sites to exploit users and strip away their privacy. <a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb: The Growth Story You Didn’t Know</a> is a case in point here.</p><p>It saddens me to read articles that trumpet the growth of Uber, despite dubious tactics like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">identifying and tagging iPhones even after the owner has deleted the Uber app app and erased the device</a>. Or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deceiving authorities and blocking officials from the Uber service</a>.</p><p>It’s not just Uber. Marketers continued to praise Facebook’s growth even after revelations that the social media giant used tools like Onavo to pay kids as young as 13 to give them root access to their devices. And then made gross intrusions into their privacy by opening up personal messages, photos, videos, emails, and even Amazon order history, while publicly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onavo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posing as a privacy-focused app</a>.</p><h3 id="marketing-and-the-social-dilemma">Marketing and The Social Dilemma</h3><p>I watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81254224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Social Dilemma</a>, a fantastic documentary that should be mandatory viewing in schools. And it made me feel genuinely embarrassed for my profession.</p><p>In the film, we see a bunch of people who’ve made a killing by moving around from one unethical corporation to another. Then in the documentary we see their profound discomfort with the damage their features inflict on people who use them.</p><p>We all know about the negative consequences of the Instagram society – living for likes, and worse besides. My problem is, again, that we glorify these tricks because in marketing, growth is gold. The Social Dilemma unpeels the attention economy and reveals the rotten core that is ‘growth at all costs’ thinking. It shows the wilful ignorance at play here, with powerful people actively avoiding information that exposes uncomfortable truths.</p><p>None of these people are evil. But that’s precisely what is so dangerous, because they are actively contributing to a society-wide problem. As Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce once said, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-cigarettes-marc-benioff-salesforce-a9265756.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook “is the new cigarettes for our society”</a>. Some think it made them look cool, but in 20 years it will look quite different. We stand to be judged by future generations.</p><h3 id="dark-patterns-and-sludges">Dark Patterns and Sludges</h3><p>I am deeply concerned about the proliferation of two disturbing trends in user interface design that are actively promoted as growth hacks by marketers:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark patterns:</strong> Features that coerce, steer or deceive users into unintended and potentially harmful actions</li><li><strong>Sludges:</strong> Processes that are made deliberately difficult to encourage users into a pathway that will go against their best interests.</li></ul><p>What is even more dubious than these dark patterns and sludges? Stand up Nir Eyal, and others like him, who, having played a big part in creating the problem, go on to make even more money by selling the solution. Eyal wrote Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products to teach founders how to build addictive products. He followed it up with Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, which teaches consumers how to avoid the addictive design of the products he himself helped to shape.</p><h3 id="the-ethics-of-marketing-agencies">The Ethics of Marketing Agencies</h3><p>No, I’m not about to argue that marketing agencies are evil. But I do think their business model is flawed, and this can have unethical consequences. I’ve worked with agencies both as an employee and a client, and there are a number of reasons why I’ve resisted setting up my own traditional agency:</p><ul><li>The agent/principal problem – Most agencies sell time, and their business model only works if they take a cookie-cutter approach. The more copy and pasting they do, the better their returns. It is simply inefficient to be creative and do a ton of original research for every new client.</li><li>No skin in the game – Nassim Taleb explains this brilliantly in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/0241247470" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Skin in the Game</a> but basically, regardless of the outcome of any project, an agency simply collects the fees and risks nothing. Famously, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hertz had to sue Accenture</a> to recover $32m they paid for a website rebuild which was allegedly incomplete and poor quality. Accenture offered to fix the shortcomings for an extra $10m.</li><li>You might be a world-class marketer, but if you set up an agency and hire people, much of your day-to-day work will shift from marketing to running a business.</li><li>Agencies routinely assign high-skilled marketers to create a pitch, or play a prominent role in the early stages, only to pass the real work down to junior staff or even outsource it. If you’re lucky, you’ll get to see that talented individual again – when your contract comes up for renewal.</li></ul><p>If we widen our lens on the agency, we see that most clients are surprisingly okay with all that. And that’s because for them, hiring an agency is not about the deliverables; it’s about validation and even covering their own backside.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. When one of the Big Four is hired to tackle a complex issue, they are not hired primarily for their skills or capacity to solve that problem. It’s more that in the event of their failure to solve it, the CEO will be able to stand up to the Board and say: “Well, the problem turned out to be so difficult that even the Big Four were stumped.” In other words, the agency relationship is more about blame reduction than business outcomes.</p><p>Do all agencies suffer from these problems? Of course not. In fact, I’m currently working with an amazing agency that is truly ethical and, as far as I can see, always does the right thing for the client, even that eats into their profit margin. But it’s important to be aware of these issues and mitigate the risks.</p><p>Here are some Ethical Marketing Principles I stand by:</p><h4 id="dont-use-dark-patterns">Don’t use dark patterns</h4><p>This one’s pretty self-explanatory. Don’t use any deceptive tactics to trick your users into doing things they don’t want to.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-the-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy">Don’t fall for the Texas sharpshooter fallacy</h4><p>Good marketing involves experimentation. When you run an experiment, it will sometimes deliver positive outcomes that were unintended and outside scope. Don’t try to spin them into some sort of tactic you planned all along. Some things just happen for no particular reason.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-action-bias">Don’t fall for action bias</h4><p>Don’t fall for the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing.</p><h4 id="be-transparent">Be transparent</h4><p>Things can and do go wrong. The minute you notice something wrong on a joint problem, ‘fess up! Then give your full attention to solving the problem.</p><h4 id="be-direct">Be direct</h4><p>Being direct (though not to the point of rudeness) with people you work with is a sign of respect. It means you’re a responsible adult and you’re treating others as such. Focus on delivering the true message and not on repackaging it.</p><h4 id="use-ethically-sourced-data">Use ethically-sourced data</h4><p>Only use consumer data that the user willingly shared or that was captured with full consent in place. For Account-Based Marketing (ABM) campaigns the data can come from third parties, but it will always be data that the consumer shared knowingly.</p><h4 id="protect-your-users-privacy">Protect your users’ privacy</h4><p>Only capture and use data that it is absolutely necessary and wherever possible, avoid Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</p><h4 id="avoid-confirmation-bias">Avoid confirmation bias</h4><p>Don’t actively seek out and assign more weight to evidence that confirms your own hypothesis.</p><h4 id="be-sustainable">Be sustainable</h4><p>Don’t promote products or services that encourage wasteful or unhealthy behaviour.</p><h4 id="work-with-companies-that-add-value-to-society">Work with companies that add value to society</h4><p>Your organisation, its products and services should not exploit anyone. Instead, they should have a positive impact on other people and the world around you.</p><h4 id="dont-lie-with-statistics">Don’t lie with statistics</h4><p>Always present your findings in the most transparent manner. Don’t use flawed correlations, or cherry-pick data that suits your own interests. Share all your results regardless of the outcome; it’s scary how many studies end up unpublished when the results don’t favour the researcher.</p><h4 id="be-open-minded-and-dont-fall-for-reactive-devaluation">Be open-minded and don’t fall for reactive devaluation</h4><p>Evaluate all options and opinions available. Don’t rush to dismiss certain opinions just because they come from a source that you habitually disagree with.</p><h4 id="identify-and-point-out-sunk-cost-fallacies">Identify and point out sunk cost fallacies</h4><p>It’s not uncommon to see projects continuing simply because of the vast amount of money already spent on them, even though the outcomes won’t be those expected. Point out the problem when that happens and work constructively to save the project.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-information-bias">Don’t fall for information bias</h4><p>Sometimes you find teams searching for additional information even when it’s not going to affect the decision. Find ways to make the best decisions with the minimum amount of information.</p><h4 id="dont-be-seduced-by-groupthink">Don’t be seduced by groupthink</h4><p>If you truly believe something, then be prepared to stand by for your ideas and push back even if the majority disagrees</p><h4 id="dont-overlook-governance">Don’t overlook governance</h4><p>Work within governance mechanisms, and follow established processes where possible. Where no process is in place, create one.</p><h4 id="be-good">Be good</h4><p>Google famously had a ‘Don’t be …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

        <p>On Oct 23, 2020, GitHub Inc. published a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/bccf7d0dbfec423c4a967f668be47b6339d15893">takedown notice</a> after taking down <a href="https://yt-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a>’s main repository as well as a number of its forks.</p>
<p>youtube-dl is a Python library which can be used to decode stream URLs of a large variety of services. This allows third-party video players to stream videos, legitimately download copies and much more. It has been used as the basis for many other applications, but also ships with a CLI front end targeting advanced users.</p>
<p>The takedown request is justified with so-called <em>anti-circumvention</em> laws, as well as a German court decision. There are plenty of rumors on the Internet around this case, but a lot of them are apparently wrong. Therefore, in this blog post, we’ll have a glance at the request as well as the German laws and the court decision. We also discuss several third-party responses.</p>
<p>There is one important fact that needs to be stressed: <strong>This text was not written by lawyers and does not provide any legal advice.</strong> It simply provides a third-party analysis of the situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-anti-circumvention-laws">What are anti-circumvention laws?</h2>
<p>To understand what “anti-circumvention” means and why such laws are implemented around the globe, we need to look into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty"><em>WIPO Copyright Treaty</em></a> of 1996. Its terms were implemented in laws in the countries which ratified it. For instance, in the US, the terms are codified via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a>. In the EU, multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)">directives</a> were passed, which subsequently were implemented in national law by the participating countries, the most relevant being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Society_Directive#Technological_protection_measures">Information Society Directive</a> of 2001.</p>
<p>The treaty aimed to create a global framework around copyright as a consequence of the rise of information technology. It is one of the so-called “internet treaties”, a nickname also assigned to the <em>WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty#Article_11._Obligations_concerning_Technological_Measures">Article 11</a> is the most interesting one. It forbids the circumvention of “effective technological measures” designed to restrict access to works. This is what is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention">“anti-circumvention”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contracting Parties shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty#Article_11._Obligations_concerning_Technological_Measure">WIPO Copyright Treaty, Article 11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concrete national implementations of such anti-circumvention laws are (non-exhaustively):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201-">Title 17 U.S. Code, Section 1201(a)(1)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__95a.html">§ 95a UrhG</a> (Germany, <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/englisch_urhg.html#p0723">English translation</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In nearly any jurisdiction, you can assume that it is likely not legal to produce, e.g., algorithms which circumvent any kind of protective measure which is supposed to restrict access to copyrighted materials. This is showcased in the U.S. law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that—</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;</li>
<li>(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or</li>
<li>(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person’s knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.</li>
</ul>
<p>– <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">17 U.S.C. Section 1201(a)(2)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="effective-technological-measures">“Effective technological measures”</h2>
<p>The rules are pretty strict. Even just creating a tool circumventing such measures is apparently prohibited. But what on earth is an “effective technological measure”? To answer that question, we need to read a bit further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) As used in this subsection–</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) to “circumvent a technological measure” means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and</li>
<li>(B) a technological measure “effectively controls access to a work” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>– <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">17 U.S.C. Section 1201(a)(3)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Established methods which are typically considered “circumvention” include tools which bypass software licensing (keygens, reverse-engineered passwords or serial numbers, tools which deactivate digital rights management (DRM), etc.).</p>
<p>The legally-inclined programmer could be tempted to interpret these words in a strict technological manner. But it is inadvisable to do so. If you want to know whether what you do (or your code does) is legal, consider consulting an actual lawyer. They’re the experts. They studied for many years to be able to provide you, the layman, with a competent answer.</p>
<p>Anyway, ultimately, it is the courts which are going to interpret the laws and decide whether a specific method qualifies as such a measure under that definition.</p>
<h2 id="german-court-judgement">German court judgement</h2>
<p>The complaint filed with GitHub specifically cited a <a href="http://www.landesrecht-hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bsharprod.psml?showdoccase=1&amp;doc.id=JURE180006255&amp;st=ent">decision made by a German court</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landgericht_Hamburg">Landgericht Hamburg</a> (LG Hamburg). The judgement was made in a case filed by an association representing artists in Germany against a web portal that allowed users to download MP3 files converted from videos on YouTube. The association obtained a restraining order against the company operating the service, whose owners had apparently signed multiple declarations to cease and desist from providing this service for specific music videos before, but continued to operate the service in general.</p>
<p>The complaint this time didn’t focus on concrete violations of the German Urheberrecht (UrhG) (Germany doesn’t have “copyright” like, e.g., the U.S., but “authors' rights” instead). It argued that operating such a service would bypass such “effective technological measures” implemented by YouTube, and this is supposedly not allowed per § 95a UrhG.</p>
<p>YouTube does not provide direct access to the streams. It provides the URLs in some obfuscated (encoded) form, which the JavaScript code in their web front end is capable of decoding. The URLs themselves are freely accessible once decoded – no sessions, cookies or logins required. The “protective technological measure”, if you want to call it that, is this obfuscation.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s not difficult to reverse engineer this obfuscation. Actually, it is rather easy, as the code executed in the browser is directly readable to programmers. They can inspect the behavior easily. Once you understand how the decoding works, you’re able to implement it in other programming languages as well.</p>
<p>The court, however, considered the obfuscation a “technological measure”. It indicated that this is partially due to the fact that YouTube apparently intends users to use their own web client, and doesn’t provide the stream URLs freely. Thus, it decided that the service violated the anti-circumvention laws.</p>
<p>So, even though you may be allowed to <em>create a copy</em> of the material (for example when the work is licensed under a Creative Commons license, used in compliance with “fair use” rules, or the user is in a country like Germany where they can create a legal <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie">“Privatkopie”</a>), downloading the original streams might not be legal. The anti-circumvention laws don’t take into account whether creating a copy would be legal. They criminalize the entire method.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-complaint-sent-to-github">Analyzing the complaint sent to GitHub</h2>
<p>The complaint sent to GitHub is not a typical DMCA takedown request. Usually, those cite a specific violation, e.g., an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material. Here, however, the complaint targets a tool which <em>could</em> be used to commit violations by downloading protected works. They claim that the tool’s “clear purpose” was, on the one hand, to circumvent technological measures, and, on the other hand, to allow for copyright violations subsequently.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the complaint cites three (potential) copyright violations in software tests, which actually download some media of artists the plaintiff appears to represent. These might be considered a “Privatkopie” in other jurisdictions, but both the plaintiff and GitHub are located in the US, so they probably focus on their national legislation, where they might be considered “fair use”.</p>
<p>One thing that remains unclear is whether GitHub would be required to take down such a project immediately upon such a notification. Most companies usually comply with the request to make sure they won’t run into issues themselves, then consult their own lawyers and assess whether it’s lawful.</p>
<p>What is certainly annoying is that neither the RIAA nor GitHub allowed youtube-dl to consult lawyers themselves, nor gave them the chance to remove the offending code (even if just temporarily). They deactivated the entire repository, so that not even the issues (which are valuable information, and are rather unlikely to offend anti-circumvention laws) are accessible anymore. But chances are that they did so in line with their terms of service. It wouldn’t be unusual to have a clause that allows them to disable a project entirely and not just selectively.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is one interesting detail that should be highlighted: the parties in this complaint are the hosting service, GitHub, and the association representing the artists. YouTube apparently is not a participant in this case. This makes sense if you recall the wording of the laws mentioned before, but is indeed a bit awkward when you think about it.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Many people on the Internet flooded forums like Reddit and Hacker News, as well as bug trackers and the (anti)social media with inaccurate statements, suggesting that the main issue here is that the tests cited use URLs of …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>CoBox aims to encourage small- and medium-scale infrastructure as a service. This means non-technical people can plug in a small computer in their home and begin providing back-up services for their friends, neighbours and themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://cobox.cloud/how-it-works/cobox-demo_v1.0.0.mp4">watch our demo</a></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The cloud we have become used to looks nothing like the many scattered fluffy light weight balls of water vapor floating in the Earth’s troposphere. Corporate cloud architectures are much more akin to a giant storm cloud, ever expanding, sucking in more and more electrical energy from its surrounding environment, with a singular giant eye sitting at their center observing all that passes through.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustrated logos of open source software" src="https://cobox.cloud/media/pages/how-it-works/19173948-1594064678/logos-all.png" width="400"></figure>
<p>CoBox wants to facilitate a transition away from giant data centers, huge storm clouds, towards a vision of cloud infrastructure that is light, distributed, and importantly, is offline-first. Our team is fed up of using proprietary software that surveilles our behaviour and transmutes the way we act online, the friends we make and the interactions we have - our data - into corporate financial gain. CoBox is the beginning of a sovereign commons-based data infrastructure and a co-operative distributed cloud architecture.</p>
<p>Our team has worked with privacy tools and encryption for many years. We’ve tried our best to avoid using corporate architecture, and we understand, its hard. Corporate tools can be high quality and accessible - they have the money to pay for beautiful and intuitive user interfaces and enough servers to maintain a high speed service. But by having no alternatives to corporate tools, corporations get to determine how we use them and shape our very behaviour. By continuously using their tools, we’re letting them shape and change how we think. And while they apparently provide these tools for ‘free’, they’re making a tidy profit monetising the way we act on their platforms.</p>
<p>We want to use software built and maintained by our peers, by people we trust, that centers both our personal sovereignty and a common recognition that assets and wealth should be shared, not concentrated. Our vision sees friends, freelancers, small businesses and co-operatives, providing mutual assistance for each other, guaranteeing remote backup of their data and ensuring that they need not rely on giant corporations or flimsy hard drives to secure their memories. That’s why we built CoBox.</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>CoBox is an innovative suite of open hardware and software providing accessible governance tools for organisations and networks. </p>
<figure><img alt="The CoBox hardware device" src="https://cobox.cloud/media/pages/how-it-works/197747488-1601292912/cobox-mint.jpg" width="600"></figure>
<p>CoBox is built on <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>. Dat is a modular peer-to-peer technology stack.  You can find a good explanation of how it works in the guide <a href="https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/">‘how Dat works’</a>, and you can find out how we’ve made use of Dat in <a href="https://gitlab.com/coboxcoop/readme/-/wikis/Core-Technologies">our wiki</a>. At CoBox, we’ve used Dat to build fully encrypted private spaces that synchronise seamlessly across multiple devices. This means you, your friends and colleagues no longer have to rely on corporate servers to store your files, you can hold onto them for each-other.</p>

<p>While playing with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/eventpipe">EventPipes</a>, I wanted to better understand the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/documentation/design-docs/ipc-protocol.md">Diagnostic IPC Protocol</a>. This protocol is used to transfer diagnostic data between the .NET runtime and a diagnostic client, such as, for example, dotnet-trace. When a .NET process starts, the runtime creates the diagnostic endpoint. On Windows, the endpoint is a <strong>named pipe</strong>, and on Unix, it’s a <strong>Unix domain socket</strong> created in the temp files folder. The endpoint name begins with a ‘dotnet-diagnostic-’ string and then contains the process ID to make it unique. The name also includes a timestamp and a ‘-socket’ suffix on Unix. Valid example names are <strong>dotnet-diagnostic-2675</strong> on Windows and <strong>dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket</strong> on Unix. When you type the ps subcommand in any of the CLI diagnostics tools (for example, <code>dotnet-counters ps</code>), the tool internally lists the endpoints matching the pattern I just described. So, essentially, the following commands are a good approximation to this logic:</p>


<pre title=""># Linux
$ ls /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-*
/tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-213-11057-socket /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket
</pre>

<pre title=""># Windows
PS me&gt; [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles("\\.\pipe\", "dotnet-diagnostic-*")
\\.\pipe\dotnet-diagnostic-9272
\\.\pipe\dotnet-diagnostic-13372
</pre>


<p>The code for the .NET process listing is in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/src/Tools/Common/Commands/ProcessStatus.cs">ProcessStatus.cs</a> file. After extracting the process ID from the endpoint name, the diagnostics tool creates a Process class instance to retrieve the process name for printing. Armed with this knowledge, let’s try to intercept the communication between the tracer and the tracee.</p>



<p>Neither named pipes nor Unix domain sockets provide an API to do that easily. I started looking for the interceptors for either the kernel or user mode. I found a few interesting projects (for example, <a href="https://github.com/kobykahane/NpEtw">NpEtw</a>), but I also discovered that configuring them would take me lots of time. I then stumbled upon a post using socat to proxy the Unix domain socket traffic. I wondered if I could write a proxy too.</p>



<h3>Writing an EventPipes sniffer</h3>



<p>The only problem was how to convince the .NET CLI tools to use my proxy. I did some tests, and on Linux, it’s enough to create a Unix domain socket with the same process ID but with the timestamp set to, for example, 1.</p>



<p>Let’s take as an example a .NET process with ID equal to 2675. Its diagnostic endpoint is represented by the /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket file. In my proxy, I am creating a Unix domain socket with a path /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-1-socket. The file system will list it first, and dotnet-trace (or any other tool) will pick it up as the endpoint for the process with ID 2675:</p>

<p>The code to create the proxy socket looks as follows:</p>


<pre title="">private static async Task StartProxyUnix(int pid, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var tmp = Path.GetTempPath();
    var snoopedEndpointPath = Directory.GetFiles(tmp, $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}-*-socket").First();
    var snoopingEndpointPath = Path.Combine(tmp, $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}-1-socket");

    File.Delete(snoopingEndpointPath);

    var endpoint = new UnixDomainSocketEndPoint(snoopingEndpointPath);
    using var listenSocket = new Socket(endpoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Unspecified);
    listenSocket.Bind(endpoint);

    using var r = ct.Register(() =&gt; listenSocket.Close());

    try
    {
        var id = 1;
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            listenSocket.Listen();

            if (ct.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                return;
            }

            var socket = await listenSocket.AcceptAsync();
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s1 connected");

            // random remote socket
            var senderSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.Unix, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Unspecified);
            await senderSocket.ConnectAsync(new UnixDomainSocketEndPoint(snoopedEndpointPath));
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s2 connected");

            _ = SniffData(new NetworkStream(socket, true), new NetworkStream(senderSocket, true), id, ct);
            id += 1;
        }
    }
    catch (SocketException)
    {
        /* cancelled listen */
        Console.WriteLine($"Stopped ({snoopingEndpointPath})");
    }
    finally
    {
        File.Delete(snoopingEndpointPath);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>On Windows, it’s more complicated as there is no timestamp in the name. Thus, I decided to create a fake diagnostics endpoint that will look like an endpoint for a regular .NET process but, in reality, will be a proxy. Remember that CLI tools also call the Process.GetProcessById method, so the PID in my endpoint name must point to a valid process accessible to the current user. The process must be native, so the diagnostic endpoint name is not already taken. I picked explorer.exe 😊, and to record EventPipes traffic, I will use explorer as the target process in .NET CLI tools, as on the image below:</p>

<p>And the code for creating my proxy named pipe looks as follows:</p>


<pre title="">private static async Task StartProxyWindows(int pid, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var targetPipeName = $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}";
    var explorer = Process.GetProcessesByName("explorer").First();
    var pipeName = $"dotnet-diagnostic-{explorer.Id}";
    try
    {
        var id = 1;
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {

<p>The fake diagnostic endpoint would work on Linux too, but the timestamp is less confusing. And we can always use our proxy to send some funny trace messages to our colleagues 🤐.</p>



<p>What’s left in our implementation is the forwarding code:</p>

<p>I’m saving the recorded traffic to the eventpipes.{stream-id}.data file in the current directory. The code of the application is also in the <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/diagnostics-tools/tree/master/epsnoop">epsnoop</a> folder in my <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/diagnostics-tools">diagnostics-tools</a> repository.</p>



<h3>Analyzing the EventPipes traffic</h3>



<p>I also started working on the <a href="https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/">010 Editor</a> template. At the moment, it only understands IPC messages, but, later, I would like to add parsers for some of the diagnostic sequences as well (feel free to create a PR if you work on them too!). The template is in the <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes/blob/master/eventpipes/diagnostics-ipc-message.bt">debug-recipes</a> repository, and on a screenshot below, you can see the initial bytes sent by the <code>dotnet-counters monitor</code> command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When the call came</strong> to say my mother had died, I was working on a jigsaw of Joan MirÃ³â€™s painting <em>The Tilled Field</em> (1923-24). Like many others, I turned to jigsaws at the start of the pandemic as a way to manage stress, and symbolically reimpose order on a chaotic world. We take our consolations where we can and, as I continued with the puzzle in the days after mumâ€™s death, its tactile qualities, the spicy smell of ink and card, and the small satisfactions of placing each piece where it belonged, grounded me when the world was in bits â€“ both outside and within.</p>
<p><em>The Tilled Field</em> is an elementally life-affirming painting. A view of MirÃ³â€™s family farm in Mont-roig del Camp in Catalonia, it conjures a surreal collection of human, animal and vegetable forms, deconstructed and stylised, and heavily symbolic. Drawing on references from medieval Spanish tapestry to Catalan ceramics and cave paintings, the image is earthy, visceral and definitively a rural scene. Still, thereâ€™s something disquieting about the painting, as if it had emerged from a dream or the recesses of an unquiet mind. A tree grows a human ear and an eye; a cloud formation is also a weathervane; a piebald mare swishes her tail as her foal suckles at her teat. At its heart sits a tumbledown farmhouse straight from a dark folk tale. The smoke from its chimney suggests occupation, but the plaster walls are cracked and crumbling back to earth.</p>
<p>Since her diagnosis of dementia <span>15 years</span> ago, my mother, too, had been disintegrating, as it were, piece by piece. At each of my fortnightly visits, some further part of her seemed to have newly dropped away, leaving gaps so raw and cruel that I sometimes had to remind myself to focus on what remained. <span>COVID-19</span> put a stop to my visiting the nursing home where she spent the final decade of her life. We tried FaceTime â€˜get togethersâ€™ but my mother was blind as well as in <span>late-stage</span> dementia, so these felt like <span>one-way</span> affairs â€“ mumâ€™s eyes <span>half-closed,</span> her face unresponsive, her body giving every impression of lifelessness. At the time of her death, I hadnâ€™t seen her for four months, and her image had begun to fade in my mind.</p>
<p>Having a meaningful exchange with my mother involved delving into our shared narrative archive even as it shrank. In this way, we relived and remade the story of our life. We dipped toffee apples for bonfire night, rode donkeys on Llandudno beach, searched for the screech owl in the forest near my childhood home. Sometimes, my mother added to these memories as if they were lucid dreams she could shape at will. Meeting her where she was meant I had to map out the changing landscape of her dementia. Only there could we truly be together.</p>
<p><span>Three-year-olds</span> work by trial and error, but <span>four-year-olds</span> use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle</p>
<p>If maps are representations of a larger reality, then jigsaws are maps too. Indeed, they began life this way, as â€˜dissected mapsâ€™. Invented by the British cartographer John Spilsbury in the 1760s, the earliest puzzles were designed to make geography lessons more fun for schoolchildren and, no doubt, inculcate them early into the cult of empire. They remained classroom aids until <span>the 1800s,</span> when their manufacture was made cheaper by lithographic printing techniques, the invention of plywood and the treadle jigsaw. Over the <span>19th century,</span> what began as hand-coloured maps became printed images of monarchs and biblical illustrations, and by the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, when the ideas of Freud, Darwin, Nietzsche and the â€˜New Womanâ€™ threatened to fragment the old reality entirely, jigsaws had become popular family entertainments.</p>
<p>Like childhood itself, the early dissected maps arrived without any paper picture to act as a guide. The puzzle historian Anne Williams notes that, in 1908, Parker Bros changed the game by adding a print of the complete image to the box. With uncertainty about the destination reduced, the path grew more enticing. By the early 1930s, with the Great Depression beginning to bite, sales of jigsaws in the United States topped <span>10 million</span> a week. Enthusiasts queued at newsagents for new deliveries, much as modern lockdown puzzlers scoured the internet and traded in secondhand puzzles.</p>
<p>While there is <a href="https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-017-2151-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> to suggest that jigsaws help older people retain visuospatial memory, a recent <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13391" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> led by the psychologist Martin Doherty at the University of East Anglia in the UK is the first to investigate how children use their understanding of pictures to complete jigsaw puzzles. The study found that three-year-olds work by trial and error, but four-year-olds use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle. Such an understanding of the language of pictorial representation is the foundation of the uniquely human ability to draw and create art.</p>
<p><strong>Itâ€™s often said that</strong> old age is a second childhood. The similarity of the two states â€“ the child immersed in their magic kingdom, the old person in their memory palace â€“ isnâ€™t lost on artists, scientists and thinkers. As the child emerges from the void, accumulating experience, making connections between things and people, so the old person divests themselves, or has taken from them, those same connections, before they return to the emptiness of nonexistence.</p>
<p>When cracks first began to appear in my motherâ€™s memory, she frantically touched them up in a colour that never quite matched. Once <span>touch-ups</span> became insufficient, she began a programme of wholesale renovation in the form of confabulated memories, extending and reworking experiences that, had they been real, wouldnâ€™t have passed building regulations. Though by now immobile, sheâ€™d insist that she had taken a long walk by the seaside, or run across my brother in a pear orchard, or just returned from holiday. The further her disease advanced, the less robust her attempts at repair became, as the supply of materials with which to build them dwindled. She once told me that her mind was falling to bits, which is what happens to everything and everyone eventually. We live with entropy. Yet how hard we resist it. Much of the human project is taken up with holding together things that will, eventually and inevitably, fall apart. Witnessing my mother labouring to put her brain back together was intensely moving. Her courage and resistance were flags planted in the territory of the living, and they deepened my love for her as she grew more frail. The lesson I learned is that itâ€™s not memory that makes us human but meaning-making. Thatâ€™s where the beauty and poignancy of human life is played out.</p>
<p>Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother</p>
<p>Art is a system of meaning-making too and, in the months since mumâ€™s death, I have deepened my understanding of how it operates by â€˜dissectingâ€™ the map that is <em>The Tilled Field</em>. To complete the jigsaw of an artwork is to observe the artistâ€™s work in a way thatâ€™s almost impossible to do in a gallery. You get to know it intimately, becoming familiar with every turn of the brush, each minute gradation of colour and tone. You develop an eye for certain patterns. Particularly â€˜helpfulâ€™ or intriguing jigsaw pieces, that are vital sources of information, data points along the route to completion, take on the character of old friends. Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother. Over the weeks it takes me to complete <em>The Tilled Field</em>, its elements and some essence of the artist take up residence inside me, becoming, as the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein might have said, introjected internal objects.</p>
<p>This kind of dynamic encounter of projection and introjection with the world of people and objects is how Klein imagines the way an infant struggles to construct an integrated ego. If weâ€™re lucky, Klein suggests, we develop from fragments of desire and need, frustrated or met, into coherent selves able to meet our own desires and needs. Whispering seductively in our ears all the while is Thanatos, the death instinct, willing us back towards the comforting psychic disintegration of <span>not-feeling</span> and unbeing. For Klein, coming into being is an existential battle. For some of us the drama returns, as it did for my mother, in the long, slow process of leaving life behind.</p>
<p>Kleinâ€™s one-time disciple Donald Winnicott had something interesting to say about becoming that seems important to me, standing as I am in the shadow of my motherâ€™s death. For him, the mother is at the heart of everything â€“ her willingness to hold, handle and â€˜present objectsâ€™ to her baby, to lend him her ego for his own use, enabling him to see himself as a coherent being, separate from her (and thus able support a relationship with her). Only through her can he become whole and real. In the language of jigsaws, good-enough mothering is the guide-image that the infant requires to allow him to build an integrated self from the bits and pieces of his needs, his developing internal world and his body.</p>
<p>When, later, bereavement leaves us once more in pieces, when the mother who birthed us is no longer here, how do we put ourselves back together again? Where is the guide-picture to help us map loss when the world itself seems to be coming apart, exposing the insufficiency of the old rubrics for living?</p>
<p>The attachment theorist John Bowlby described mourning as a form of separation anxiety, akin to that felt by a child lost in a crowd. There is panic, disorientation, a shattering of reality. Freud thought that, in order to grieve healthily, we must sever our bonds with the dead, and establish new ones with the living. But even if that were desirable, cutting ties with the mother through whom one becomes a self seems to ask the impossible. Dennis Klass, an expert on bereavement, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Continuing-Bonds-New-Understandings-of-Grief/Klass-Silverman-Nickman/p/book/9781560323396" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> a more compassionate model. In his view, thereâ€™s no …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>In previous <a href="https://www.wutsi.com/read/243/build-product-using-api-first-approach">article</a>, we have explained why REST API plays a key role in your strategy for building modern application. Now we are going to share 5 steps that you can follow for designing your next REST APIs.<br>As example, we are going to show we to design a simple Blog platform to illustrate in practice how to apply those steps.</p> 
  <h2>1. Identify your Object Model</h2> 
  <p>The first step for designing your API is to identify the objects that are represented your application. In the REST world, they are called Resources. A Resource is an typed object with data.&nbsp; It's similar to Object in Oriented Object Programming, or Entities in Database.</p> 
  <p>On a Blog platform where users read articles and comment articles, we can define the Object Model for the blog platform with the following resources:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>Article</li>
   <li>Comment</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>2. Identify the URIs</h2> 
  <p>Once the Object Model has been defined, the next step is to identify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" target="_new">URI</a> for each resource of your Object Model. A URI is a unique address assigned to resources, it's a way to identify Resources on the Internet.&nbsp; For each resource in your Object Model, you must define an URI for a collection and single resource.</p> 
  <p>In our Blog example, we have the following URIs for Articles</p> 
  <pre>/articles
/articles/{id}</pre> 
  <p>And for Comments</p> 
  <pre>/articles/{id}/comments
/articles/{id}/comments/{id}</pre> 
  <p>Where</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>/articles </code>is the URI for a collection of Articles.</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}</code> is the URI of a given Article ({id} being the identifier of the article).</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}/comments</code> is the URI of the collection of Comments of a given Article. This also shows the relationship where Articles have multiple Comments.</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}/comments/{id}</code><b>&nbsp;</b> is the URI of given Comment of a given Article.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>There are some naming convention to respect when defining your Resource URIs</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>Use only nouns (usually the name of your resources), with plural and lower case</li>
   <li>Use hyphen (-) instead of underscore (_) to improve readability. <code>Example: /articles/{id}/file-location</code>.</li>
   <li>Do not use extensions. <i><code>/article/{id}/content.xml&nbsp;</code></i>is bad practice.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>3. Define the Representations</h2> 
  <p>Next step is to define the content and the format of your resources. The most common formats are <code>JSON</code>, <code>XML</code> or <code>Protobuf</code>. For each resource in your Object Model, you must define a representation for a collection and single resource.</p> 
  <h3>Representation of a Collection of Articles</h3> 
  <p>When returning a collection resource, include only the most important information about the resources. This will keep the size of payload small, and so will improve the performance of REST APIs.</p> 
  <p>For example for a Blog, the collection representation will not return the article content because it would inflate the size of the data.</p>

     }  
  ]
}</pre> 
  <h2>Representation of a Single Article</h2> 
  <p>For a single resource, you the representation should include all information about the resource</p> 
  <pre>{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "Top 10 African football players",
  "author": "Ray Sponsible",
  "published-date": "2020/10/12"
  "summary": "This article present the best african players ever"
  "word-count": 700,
  "reading-time-minutes": 3,
  "category": "sport",
  "language": "fr",
  "status": "published",
  "tags": [
     "football",
     "roger milla",
     "thomas nkono", 
  ],
  "content": "This is the content of the article and is very very long.... "
}</pre> 
  <h3>Representation of a Collection of Comments</h3> 
  <pre>{
 "comments": [
    {
      "id": 1111,
      "text": "This article is really amazing... I love it!",
      "comment-date": "2020-12-01",
      "author": null
    },
    {

  "comment-date": "2020-12-01",
  "author": null
  "language": "fr",
  "sentiment": 4.5
}</pre> 
  <h2>4. Assign HTTP Methods</h2> 
  <p>The next step is to define how to access your resources via HTTP. For that, you need to use the standard HTTP methods:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>GET</code>&nbsp;to retrieve Resources</li>
   <li><code>POST</code> to create or update a Resource</li>
   <li><code>DELETE</code> to delete a Resource</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>Browse all Articles.</h3> 
  <p>To return all the articles available</p> 
  <pre>GET /articles</pre> 
  <p>If your blog have 1 millions articles, you cannot return your whole collection of articles in one request. This is why API provide the ability to paginate collections using the parameter: <code>limit</code>&nbsp;(max number of resources to return) and <code>offset</code>(index of the 1st resource starting at 0).</p> 
  <pre>GET /articles?limit=100&amp;offset=0</pre> 
  <p>API also provide filtering parameter to filter collections. To search all the articles having the status <code>published</code> in the category <code>sport</code></p> 
  <pre>GET /articles?category=sport&amp;status=published&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0</pre> 
  <h3>Create a new Article</h3> 
  <p>To create a new Article:</p> 
  <pre>POST /articles</pre> 
  <p>The payload sent to the creation of the article:</p> 
  <pre>{
  "title": "5 Steps for creating REST API",
  "author": "Ray Sponsible",
  "published-date": "2020/10/12"
  "summary": "Easy way to design REST API"
  "word-count": 700,
  "reading-time-minutes": 3,
  "category": "programming",
  "language": "en",
  "status": "published",
  "tags": [
     "rest"
  ],
  "content": "The purpose of this article is to show you 5 simple steps for...."
}</pre> 
  <p>Please note that request payload will not contain any&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute, as the server is responsible for deciding it.</p> 
  <p>The response will return the <code>id</code> of the created article.</p> 
  <pre>{
  "id": 9999
}</pre> 
  <h3>Update an Article</h3> 
  <p>To update an article</p> 
  <pre>POST /articles/999</pre> 
  <p>The payload sent for the update of the article:</p> 
  <pre>{
  "title": "5 Steps for designing REST API",
  "author": "Ray Sponsible",
  "published-date": "2020/10/12"
  "summary": "Easy way to design REST API"
  "word-count": 700,
  "reading-time-minutes": 3,
  "category": "programming",
  "language": "en",
  "status": "published",
  "tags": [
     "rest",
     "json" 
  ],
  "content": "The purpose of this article is to show you 5 simple steps for...."
}</pre> 
  <p>Please note that request payload will not contain any&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute, as its part the the URI of the article to update.</p> 
  <p>The response will return the&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;of the updated article:</p> 
  <pre>{
  "id": 9999
}</pre> 
  <h3>Delete an Article</h3> 
  <p>To delete an article:</p> 
  <pre>DELETE /articles/999</pre> 
  <p>Deleting resources do not return data.</p> 
  <h2>5. What about Errors</h2> 
  <p>Because things never works as expected, you should also design for the case when things will go sour!</p> 
  <p>For REST API, you should use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_new">HTTP status codes</a> to report the status of each interaction with your API.&nbsp; The most used HTTP codes are the following:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>200</code>: Everything worked.</li>
   <li><code>400</code>: The request is invalid. <br>Exemple: search an article with invalid status <code>xxx</code>.&nbsp;</li>
   <li><code>401</code>: Unauthorized. An anonymous user trying to access a resource that requires authentication.<br>Example: anonymous user trying to create a new article</li>
   <li><code>403</code>: Forbidden. You do not have enough privilege to access a resource.&nbsp;<br>Example: A user trying to delete an article of another user!</li>
   <li><code>404</code>: The resource requested was not found.</li>
   <li><code>409</code>: There is a conflict in the state of the resource.<br>Example: creating a user with an email already assigned to another user.</li>
   <li><code>500</code>: Something wrong happened on the server.<br>Example: Server database is down!</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>For all interaction that result to an error, a good practice is to return also a standard response containing the details of the error. </p> 
  <p>For exemple&nbsp;<code>GET /article?status=xxx&amp;limit=500</code> would return the status code <code>400&nbsp;</code>with the following response:&nbsp;</p> 
  <pre>{
  "errors":[
     {
       "code": "invalid_status",
       "message": "Got 'xxx'. Expecting 'published' or 'draft'"
     },
     {
       "code": "invalid_limit",
       "message": "Limit must be lower than 200"
     }
  ]
}</pre>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p>

<p>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, a documentary audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they've come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 30, The Dragon Speech, and Chris Crawford's improbable dream.</p>

<p>We'll get going in just a moment. </p>

<p>*pause for pre-roll ad slot*</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Chris Crawford didn't always have a dream. He wasn't always tormented by a menacing dragon that he could not defeat.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><em><p>it wasn't so very long ago, when I knew the dragon. It was in nineteen seventy five when I first encountered the concept of a computer game. That was a new concept to me. For me, the computer had always been a tool for scientific calculation.</p><p>Now, the notion of using it to play…well, that was a fascinating and utterly unconventional concept to me. And so I decided to begin to acquaint myself with this technology. I had no dream as yet. For me, the dragon still slept…</p></em></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>He was a teacher at the time, parlaying his knowledge of physics to students at a small community college in Nebraska, and he'd just met a man who was attempting to program a computerised version of a boardgame — a strategy wargame called Blitzkrieg.</p>

<p>Intrigued, he started to ponder the problem. And before long he made his own computer game, a turn-based tactical wargame he called Wargy 1. You played against a computer-controlled opponent with help from a physical board and some pieces from an Avalon Hill boardgame. You'd make your moves on the board, then input them into the computer, and in return it would print out coordinates for its own moves.</p>

<p>That game would eventually become a commercial program called Tanktics, which he initially self-published for Commodore-PET computers in 1978 — for a grand total of 150 sales, which was impressive at the time. And in 1981 he would have the game re-published on multiple systems by Avalon Hill.</p>

<p>But by then Chris was firmly entrenched in the video game business. He'd left his teaching job to join Atari in 1979, eager to become a part of this exciting video game revolution. At Atari he briefly learnt the basics of programming for the Video Computer System, or the Atari 2600, as we know it today, before he shifted over to the group that really excited him — the group focused on developing games for the Atari 800 home computer, which at the time had the finest graphics and sound capabilities of any home computers on the market.</p>

<blockquote><em><p>The 800 was so far ahead of everything else. It was the machine to learn on, and I knew nothing about graphics and sound. So I hurled myself into the machine, absorbing everything I could, learning all about graphics and sound. Some of you may find it ironic to learn that for a time there I was known as 'the graphics wizard of Atari'. And indeed, there was a period of time there where my game, Eastern Front, was the most graphically advanced product in the marketplace. Because that was a phase I needed to go through. I needed to understand that.</p>

<p>I needed to feel that I had a good grip on it.</p>

<p>And so all through this period, from 1975 to 1981, for six years, I was apprenticing myself to this technology. I was turning it over and over in my hands. I was getting the feel of it in my fingertips. And for six years I had no dream at all. All I did was learn. And by 1981 I felt that I understood the technology. I felt that I knew what this medium was about, but I had no dream I could — I couldn't see the dragon, but by 1981 I could hear him thrashing about in the forest. I knew he was out there somewhere. I knew he was big, whatever he was, and I wanted to find it. And then in one of those fortuitous circumstances that is so perfectly timed that we can only ascribe its event, its occurrence, to the the workings of fate, then Alan Kay came into my life.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>And here, in 1981 — this is where our story starts. That name, Alan Kay, may sound familiar to you; he's one of the fathers of the personal computer, and of a concept called the Dynabook, which eventually manifested in the form of the iPad. Alan Kay did a PhD in computer science in the late 1960s, where he was mentored by the fathers of computer graphics, Ivan Sutherland and David Evans, and then joined Xerox PARC, the research and development company that created the Xerox Alto computer — which would inspire Apple to create the Macintosh. Alan Kay and his colleagues at Xerox also invented the concept of object-oriented programming, as well as graphical user interfaces and lots of other forward-thinking things that took decades to turn into mainstream technologies.</p>

<p>In 1981, Alan Kay became Atari's chief scientist. He was hired to form a corporate research group that would push the boundaries of what's possible with video games. And Chris was asked to join that group, to apprentice himself to this great master of technology — whose mind races decades ahead, who could see and describe revolutions coming 20, 30, 50 years before they actually hit us.</p>

<p>Alan Kay had a massive influence on Chris, and he taught Chris myriad lessons. But Chris recalls that one lesson stood out above all else.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chris Crawford: I'd say the most important one was to dream big, or aim high. One of his most useful adages was if you don't fail at least 90 percent of the time, you're not aiming high enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>***</p>

<blockquote><em><p>Another way of viewing dreaming is to think in terms of alternate realities. There is, of course, reality, the real reality. But when we fantasise, we create an imaginary, a desired universe. But we don't care about whether the universe works, whether it's possible. Only when we dream do we create a universe that is actually possible.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>When Alan Kay taught Chris to dream, and dream big, Chris did exactly that. He dreamed of what games might become, of what games could be. At first his dream was imprecise, unclear, but as he thought upon it more, and as he wrote his first book, The Art of Computer Game Design, slowly it solidified in his mind.</p>

<blockquote><em><p>And by 1983, I had my dream. I could see the dragon clearly in my mind's eye.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about my dream.</p>

<p>I dreamed of the day when computer games would be a viable medium of artistic expression, an art form. I dreamed of computer games encompassing the broad range of human experience and emotion, computer games about tragedy or self-sacrifice, games about duty and honour, patriotism, of satirical games about politics or games about human folly. Games about man's relationship to God, or to nature. Games about the passionate love between a boy and a girl, or the serene and mature love between [a] husband and wife of decades. Games about family relationships or death, mortality, a boy becoming a man or a man realising he is no longer young. Games about a man facing truth at high noon on a dusty main street, or boy and his dog, or a prostitute with a heart of gold. </p>

<p>All of these things and more were part of this dream, but by themselves they amounted to nothing because all of these things have already been done by other art forms. There's no advantage, no purchase, no — nothing superior about this dream. It's just an old rehash.

<p>The critical piece of Chris's dream, the part to made it so important to him, that elevated it above the idea of games as an imitation of other art forms, to become a true art form all their own — that was interactivity. Games are interactive. They tap into a need to learn through play that's hardwired into our very being. Chris wanted all those things he dreamed of to be presented in a deeply interactive way, in a way that was unique only to video games.</p>

<p>So he began to work on turning his dream to reality.</p>

<p>This work involved an attempt to lead by example — to make games about social interaction, games about geopolitics (and it's …</p></div></div>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>I’ve been sitting on the “other” side of the table for a while now. Did around hundred of them. Primarily for software engineering positions, but I had my shot of fun with QA, sys admins and many others.</p>



<p>Frankly, I’ve always loved them. They kind of combine couple of passions that I deeply enjoy immersing myself in – presenting, learning, and seeing people grow. Presenting the company, learning about the candidate and seeing them grow as we provide positive reinforcement.</p>



<p>And trust me, I’ve seen my fair share of candidates. I’ve interviewed all kinds of people – introverts, extroverts, brilliant geniuses, loud and quiet folks, ordinary next-door neighbours and all kinds of weirdos. People who were excited to be there and those who appeared to have arrived from a different planet. You name it and I’ve seen it.</p>



<p>And yet, one thing is unique for pretty much all of them – I’ve enjoyed them all!</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>It was Tuesday, I think. I’ve been experimenting with publishing my articles on different days and, for no reason whatsoever, I chose to publish this one on Tuesday. Tuesday would do it. It was the article where I explained how we all are anxious about something and how I’m dealing with my share of it.</p>



<p>“You know what you should be writing about?”, asked a good friend of mine. She’d been following my blog from the very beginning and had always provided me with a great feedback. </p>



<p>“No. Tell me?”, I proceeded. “You should write an article on how to survive a job interview as an anxious introvert”.</p>



<p>And this got me puzzled. It got me puzzled for multiple reasons that are beyond explanation here, but one of the main reasons being the fact that this was a person with almost ten years of professional experience, who was, among other great things, extremely good at her job. Companies would be fighting over her, should she decide to apply. And yet, she struggled.</p>



<p>“But I don’t get it,”, I said, “why would YOU be anxious of interviews? You are great at what you do, you have perfect soft skills and you just have experience to prove that”.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s just that I see my friend, who is an extreme extrovert, having such an easy and fun time while interviewing, whereas I’d probably start sweating and collapse from a panic attack. How do I even compete against an extrovert who presents themselves way better than I do?”. </p>



<p>Ouch!</p>



<h2>It’s scary because it’s unknown</h2>



<p>There is a famous quote, said by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which goes like:</p>



<blockquote><p>Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, <em><strong>there are known knowns</strong></em>; there are things we know we know. We also know <strong><em>there are known unknowns</em></strong>; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But <strong><em>there are also unknown unknowns</em></strong> —the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Even though the context was a bit different, the concept of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns is a useful one. Let’s put it into the context of job interviews.</p>



<h4>Known knowns</h4>



<p>Known knowns are things that you know that you know. Things like – job that you are applying for, skills required to apply, etc. Pretty much everything that you are (hopefully) aware of at the time when you are applying.</p>



<p>Assuming that you already did your due diligence, we won’t be bothering with these.</p>



<h4>Known unknowns</h4>



<p>Known unknowns are things that you are aware of, but you don’t know much about them. These are things like – how are the interviews handled at this company, what are they really looking for, who the interviewers are, etc.</p>



<p><span>These are the things where you need to put your detective cap on and – investigate</span>! The more you care about the company that you are applying for, the more time you should invest at this stage.</p>



<p>Start by learning more about the company and their values. Go to their website and read what they are about. Are they multi-national? Who their clients are and what their company values are.</p>



<p>Next, try and learn how this company does their interviews. Google for “[company name] interviews”. Look for websites dedicated to leaving the reviews of companies (e.g. Glassdoor). Make sure to look for websites local to your country (e.g. in Serbia we have Joberty and Helloworld).</p>



<p>Now go and learn who their employees are. Open up the LinkedIn and search for the company name. Explore who works there. What their education and their backgrounds are. Look for HRs, recruiters and interviewers. Learn about them. Google some of them as well.</p>



<p>Finally, ask around. See if there’s anyone working there who you might have contact with. Ask them for more info.</p>



<p>Rule of a thumb is – <span>the more you learn upfront, the more confident you will feel; and, in turn, the less anxious you will become.</span></p>



<h4>Unknown unknowns</h4>



<p>Unknown unknowns are things that you don’t even know are there. <span>These are the things that make you anxious without you even realizing it. And that’s exactly where this article comes to rescue.</span> So, bookmark it!</p>



<p>The issue here is that you can’t really prepare because you have no clue what to prepare for. <span>Do your fair share of dealing with known unknowns, make peace with statements that I write about and, trust me, you’ll do perfect.</span> I promise!</p>



<p>So, let’s start.</p>



<h2>It’s OK to feel nervous</h2>



<p>Let me put this as simple as possible. <span>Job interviews are stressful</span>. They just are and there’s no way around it. <span>Regardless of your personality type, there is a highly likelihood of hitting at least one of the most common anxieties</span> — speaking in public, presenting yourself, facing the unknown, showcasing your skills, solving (whiteboard) problems, …</p>



<p>If you’re lucky – you’re dealing with one anxiety only. But if you’re like most people – you’re probably hitting a jackpot. Doubly so if it’s a job that you really care about. Ouch!</p>



<p>But let me tell you this – we, the interviewers are aware of this. We expect you to be nervous, panicky, sweating and stuttering. Not because we’re a sadistic bunch but because we know that interviews make people nervous. And that’s OK, really! We absolutely do not expect you to be as cool as a cucumber. Cool for you if you are, but it doesn’t make any difference to us. We will NOT judge you for it.</p>



<h2>It’s OK to ask</h2>



<p>This is such an under appreciated and yet, such and easy and powerful thing you can do. Whoever was the person you had initial contact with (usually an HR or a Recruiter), just ask them what you can expect during the interview and what you should do to better prepare.</p>



<p>I can guarantee that you will never be judged for asking. Quite the contrary. You will show that you are interested in preparing upfront, which, at least to me, is a positive thing. A win-win.</p>



<h2>Our job is to make you feel comfortable</h2>



<p>Now this seems to blow people’s brains. And I have no idea why so, but it’s a fact.</p>



<p>Our job, as interviewers, is to help you relax. Seriously. And not because we’re particularly fond of you, but <span>because we WANT to help you present yourself in the best possible way</span>. You can even call it selfish if you want, but it kind of benefits both sides 🙂</p>



<p>We don’t want you redlining your heart rate. Quite the opposite. And, a win-win, really.</p>



<h2>Interviewers are nervous as well</h2>



<p>Weird, right? Unless you’ve been on the other side of the table, you probably never even thought about it. But it’s a fact.</p>



<p>We, the interviewers, get nervous and anxious as well. It can really range from a mild anxiety due to the fact that we are interviewing a candidate we’d really like to hire, all the way to sitting across the table from a person who, for lack of better word – makes us nervous.</p>



<p><span>The only difference between you, the interviewee, and us, the interviewers, is that we’ve done so many of the interviews that we lowered those anxities to manageable levels.</span> And we learn to keep ourselves cool. It’s just practice &amp; repetition really.</p>



<h2>What if you encounter an unpleasant interviewer?</h2>



<p>Well, that happens. Probably way more than we’d all like, but hey, …</p>



<p>But let me put it this way – <span>if you go to a restaurant and encounter a rude waiter or, even worse, an owner, would you feel bad about the fact that you are feeling bad?</span> Of course not! You’d leave that place never to return again.</p>



<p>What’s so different about interviewers then? <span>I’d see those as a perfect filter – they filter out companies that you don’t really want to work in.</span> You’re their guest and, if they don’t really care about properly welcoming you, then you have no business being there. Pay the bill (the time you spent there) and leave. Case closed.</p>



<h2>Summarized tips for surviving the interviews</h2>



<p>So, let’s quickly summarize everything that you’ve read so far:</p>



<ol><li>Learn about the company. Google for “[[ company name ]] interviews” and get familiar with it.</li><li>Learn about the interviewers, if possible. Google them if needed. Learn who they are and what they do. This might give you a clue on type of questions that you might get asked by them</li><li>It’s OK to ask. Ask your contact person how to prepare better. Let them help you. It’s a win-win.</li><li>It’s OK to be nervous. We (the interviewers) know that you probably will be. Don’t worry. We won’t judge you for it.</li><li>We’re there to help you present yourself in the best possible light. Yep. We’re trained to help you relax. We want you to show the best of yourself, given the circumstances.</li><li>We know that what you demonstrate is not a perfect representation of what you really know. Really. Anxiety, panic, nervousness, … it can be crazy and we know it. So, don’t worry. Let us help you and guide you through the process.</li><li>Finally, you can always look at it as a <em>one more rep</em>*. Really. The worst case scenario is that you have one more experience under your belt. And practice beats the talent; every single time.</li></ol>

Posing as a home theater enthusiast or cinephile, he would join the conversation in communities geared toward DVD fanatics and movie buffs, befriend the major players, and slowly, over time, alert the most respected commenters, moderators, and website owners about this great new site called Netflix. <strong>We were months from launch, but he was planting seeds that would pay off...big time</strong>.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.amazon.com/That-Will-Never-Work-Netflix/dp/0316530204/ref=nodl_">That Will Never Work</a> by Marc Randolph (Netflix)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Solely through guest blogging we’ve acquired around 100,000 users</strong> within the first 9 months of running Buffer.

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called “actions”. In other words, the Redux pattern provides state management for JavaScript apps. You can use the Redux library with any frontend framework, such as React, Angular, or even Vue. In the end, you can implement the Redux pattern in any vanilla JS application. </p><p>This article covers what Redux is, why you need it, how it works, the benefits, and when not to use Redux. To make Redux clearer, we’ll update you with code examples to make the concept easier to grasp. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="what-is-redux">What is Redux?</h2><p>As mentioned in the introduction, Redux is a pattern that facilitates state management. It allows you to maintain a predictable state container for your JavaScript apps. This is important for consumer-facing applications where the interface changes based on user input. </p><p>On top of that, Redux prevents race conditions where two components simultaneously try to update the state. It accomplishes this task by defining actions that get dispatched to reducers. </p><p>Each action contains a type (also seen as an identifier) and a payload. Next, a reducer accepts the action and changes the state based on the received action type and payload.</p><p>Reducers are pure functions, which means they are predictable. A pure function returns the same output for the same input. You can use reducers to generate a new application state.</p><p>Lastly, to notify our interface that the application state has changed, we can subscribe to data changes. Whenever the application state changes, we update the UI.</p><p>It’s a simple, yet elegant solution to facilitate predictable state management for small and large applications. Luckily, most popular frameworks offer support for Redux. Here’s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">react-redux</a>: You can add Redux to your React application by installing the <code>react-redux</code> dependency. </p></li><li><p><strong>Angular</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngrx/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@ngrx/store</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-redux/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@angular-redux/store</a>: Both options work well to implement Redux into your Angular application. According to <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/@angular-redux/store-vs-@ngrx/store-vs-@ngxs/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">npmtrends.com</a>, <code>@angular-redux/store</code> is the most popular library in terms of weekly downloads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vue</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuejs-redux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vuejs-redux</a>: This dependency offers a light-weight implementation of Redux for Vue with only 45 lines of code and no dependencies. It provides the same API as the <code>react-redux</code> dependency.</p></li></ul><p>Next, why should you use Redux?</p><h2 id="why-use-redux">Why use Redux?</h2><p>Instead of directly exploring examples, let’s learn more about the problem Redux solves. </p><p>As with many applications, they start small. Imagine a pyramid structure of seven components where each component as two child components. Each component manages its state. However, situations occur where we have to share a state with a child component or a child component wants to modify the parent component’s state.</p><p>Do you see the problem? While our application grows to a higher number of components, maintaining data consistency becomes a hairy challenge. It’s not an easy task to manage each component’s state while sharing it with many other components. You’ll likely experience data inconsistency bugs, a fearsome nightmare for frontend developers.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/f3b749e44077c9d0fbfc06e129be1439/1727d/5538b516f2c347f8846fe3c15d0d100e.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/f3b749e44077c9d0fbfc06e129be1439/1727d/5538b516f2c347f8846fe3c15d0d100e.png 1834w" sizes="(max-width: 1834px) 100vw, 1834px" alt="without Redux vs. with Redux">

Instead, we create a single store that handles our state management. On top of that, all communication regarding reading, updating, or creating data happens via the store. It prevents data inconsistency bugs from appearing. Moreover, components can listen to state changes to update the UI and avoid these data inconsistency bugs.</p><p>Lastly, you can install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux DevTools</a> that give you insights into your application’s current state to simplify debugging or testing your application. It’s a great incentive to get started with Redux.</p><p>Next, let’s explore Redux with code examples.</p><h2 id="redux-with-code-examples---how-does-it-work">Redux with code examples - How does it work?</h2><p>Let’s recap the Redux cycle before we take a look at our code example. This is how the Redux cycle looks like:</p><ol><li>Users interact with the interface and triggers an action</li><li>Action with/without payload is sent to a reducer using the dispatcher</li><li>Reducer checks if it handles the action and produces a new state based on the action and its payload</li><li>State changes are notified via subscription methods</li><li>UI renders again based on state changes received via the subscription method</li></ol><p>Now, let’s explore how this works using code. We’ll create a simple webpage that allows you to increase or decrease a counter in the state using plus and minus buttons. We’ll use a single <code>index.html</code> document that contains a script tag with all the necessary code. </p><p>You can find the completed code via <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-fundamentals-core-example-forked-nigo3?file=/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CodeSandbox.io</a>.</p><h3 id="step-1-exploring-indexhtml">Step 1: Exploring index.html</h3><p>First, let’s create an <code>index.html</code> document with the following HTML setup. This will render the current counter value and buttons to increase or decrease the counter.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Redux basic example</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span> </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://unpkg.com/redux@latest/dist/redux.min.js</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        Counter: </span><span>&lt;</span><span>span</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>count</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>0</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>increment</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>+</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>decrement</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Next, let’s take a look at how we can define actions.</p><h3 id="step-2-define-redux-actions">Step 2: Define Redux actions</h3><p>Let’s define actions we want to dispatch to the reducer when the user clicks the increase or decrease button. </p><p>We can listen for the <code>click</code> event and dispatch a new action to the Redux store, which contains the reducer. </p><p>Make sure to dispatch an object that contains the <code>type</code> property. This property contains the name of the action. As a best practice, use the format <code>&lt;reducer-name&gt;/&lt;action&gt;</code>. This makes it easier to identify actions as multiple components can send the same action. In our example, we will name the reducer <code>counter</code>. Therefore, we get the following actions:</p><ul><li><code>counter/increment</code></li><li><code>counter/decrement</code></li></ul><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>      </span><span>document</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"increment"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>          store</span><span>.</span><span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"counter/increment"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      </span><span>document</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"decrement"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>          store</span><span>.</span><span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"counter/decrement"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Next, let’s define the reducer.</p><h3 id="step-3-define-a-reducer">Step 3: Define a reducer</h3><p>As we can dispatch multiple actions to the reducer, we’ll use a switch statement to handle the different actions.</p><p>First, we define the initial state for the application by setting the <code>count</code> equal to zero.

  <section>
    <p>One of the advantages of QWidgets when building a Qt application is
the ability to build in a simple way custom widgets with the QPainter
API. This gives the Qt developer almost total freedom to implement
complex geometries for their widgets.</p>
<p>On the other hands, QML contains by default only rectangles. These
rectangles can change the radius to create circles and rounded rectangles, but more
complex shapes are more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-custom-geometry-in-qtquick">The current state of custom geometry in QtQuick</h2>
<p>Fortunally, the Qt API provides multiple ways to implement custom shapes,
that depending on the needs might be enough.</p>
<p>There is the Canvas API using the same API as the <code>canvas</code> API on the web but
in QML. It’s easy to use but very slow and I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead of the Canvas API, from the QML side, there is the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-shapes-shape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QtQuick Shapes module</a>.
This module allows creating more complex shapes directly from the QML
with a straightforward declarative API. In many cases, this is good enough
for the application developer but this module doesn’t offer a public C++
API.</p>
<p>If you need more controls, using C++ will be required to implement custom
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickItem</a>. Unfortunately drawing
on the GPU using QQuickItem is more
complex than the QPainter API. You can’t just use commands like <code>drawRect</code>,
but will need to convert all your shapes in triangles first. This involves
a lot of maths like it can be seen in the example from the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-customgeometry-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a> or from
<a href="https://www.kdab.com/efficient-custom-shapes-in-qt-quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the KDAB tutorial (Efficient custom shapes in Qt Quick)</a>.</p>
<p>A QPainer way is also available with <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickpainteditem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickPaintedItem</a>,
but it is slow because it renders your shape in a textured rectangle in the
Scene Graph.</p>
<h2 id="the-rusty-way">The Rusty way</h2>
<p>What if we could transform arbitrary shapes into triangles? We would get a
high level API but still get great performance. This process is called tessellation
and there are a few libraries that implement it. For example in C++, we
have Skia and CGAL. Unfortunatelly, both aren’t easy to use, so I decided to look
at the Rust library ecosystem and in particular at <a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>,
which was designed with performance and compliance to the SVG standard in mind
since the goal is to use it in Servo in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon doesn’t have any C++ bindings but I got inspired by the recent
<a href="https://jbbgameich.github.io/misc/2020/12/21/rust-in-a-kde-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from Jonah</a>
and I need to say the experience of writing bindings was a breeze.</p>
<p>The first step was creating wrapper <code>struct</code>s around the
Lyon primitives. <code>LyonPoint</code>, <code>LyonGeometry</code> and <code>LyonBuilder</code> will
later be directly usable from the C++ side.</p>

<p>This blog documents my journey in constructing an 8-bit relay computer, from scratch, made from tons of solder, wires,
lights, relays, sweat, tears, swearing and money.</p>
<p>The design of the computer is based on the one constructed by
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">Dr. Harry Porter</a>
at Portland State University (reproduced on this blog with kind permission) but the construction method is my own and so
this blog captures the thoughts, experiences and pitfalls that I encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Growing up in Chile, Leonardo Barrientos didn’t know much about Delaware, at least until he went to law school in Santiago. He took a couple classes on American law, and only then did he come to understand how this unassuming state had become the preferred incorporation site not just for U.S. companies but for any foreign startup seeking funding from American venture capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the global startup economy is driving more innovation than ever, founders from Chile to India to Nigeria are compelled to incorporate their companies in Delaware, if they seek sizable capital for growth. Incorporating in Delaware may seem like a dramatic imposition on a startup’s identity — doing so is often to its legal and financial detriment —but most founders accept it as a necessary step to achieving international success. The Delaware path to incorporation has become so baked into the global technology market that, rather than try to supplant it, companies are building products to help navigate the state’s complicated corporate restructuring procedure, now virtually required of foreign companies by both local and American funders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overseas startups don’t choose Delaware because of some special tax break; the practice is based on a precedent that dates back to the turn of the century. In 1899, when Delaware enacted its <a href="https://www.djcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-History-of-Delaware-Corporation-Law1.pdf">General Corporation Law</a>, the state laid the foundation for itself to become the incorporation hub of the United States. The law empowers courts to simplify the incorporation process; now, over 50% of publicly traded American companies are formed in the state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Field, a cofounder of legal-tech startup Clerky, said that this set off a feedback loop. “More and more people started gravitating there,” he said, “and the system got more mature and more built out.” As a result, lawyers across the United States — and the world — began developing Delaware-specific expertise.</p>



<p>Field said that during the dot-com bubble, many Silicon Valley companies would still form in California, but “by the mid-2000s, it really had become the de facto standard: Always form a startup as a Delaware corporation.” Today, the largest tech companies, including Google and Facebook, are all incorporated in Delaware.</p>



<p>Anil Advani is the managing partner at Inventus Law, a Silicon Valley corporate law firm. “If you’re trying to become a global company, then you want to look like, smell like, and talk like any other successful Silicon Valley company,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “When it comes to legal structure, don’t try to be creative.”</p>



<p>In Chile, where Barrientos began to learn about Delaware’s importance, he worked for one of the biggest financial consultancy firms in the country and saw firsthand how convoluted incorporation was. “You could tell how much founders struggled with legal fees and how to structure their companies correctly,” Barrientos told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Barrientos knew of products in the United States, such as Field’s Clerky and LegalZoom, that used technology to help automate legal procedures, incorporation in particular. But they catered to American startups; for overseas founders, the practice introduced a host of additional complications.</p>



<p>That’s when Barrientos decided to found his own startup, Lexgo, which makes incorporating in Delaware easier for Latin American companies. When Lexgo applied for funding from Y Combinator, the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator, Barrientos went through the Delaware incorporation process himself; it’s a requirement for all participants, foreign or American. Although Lexgo wasn’t accepted, the decision to do the paperwork immediately paid off: When Barrientos took meetings with U.S. investors, they initially weren’t interested because Lexgo was based in Santiago. “Right away, we told them, ‘We’re a U.S. company. That shouldn’t be a problem,’” he said. The company <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/432434-71#funding">raised</a> a $373,000 seed round in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If you’re trying to become a global company, then you want to look like, smell like, and talk like any other successful Silicon Valley company.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But it’s not always American venture capitalists pressuring companies to incorporate in Delaware — VCs from outside the U.S. also say they prefer their portfolio companies to be incorporated there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kayode Oyewole is a partner at Ventures Platform, an early stage Nigerian VC fund. Oyewole told <em>Rest of World </em>that his fund encourages startups it believes to have international potential to register in Delaware because it will make it easier for them to raise capital, even if years down the line. Paystack, a Nigerian payments company that was recently acquired for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">more than $200 million</a>, was backed by Ventures Platform in early investment rounds. Originally a Lagos-based entity, Paystack incorporated in Delaware in 2015.&nbsp;The push to incorporate in the U.S. has had knock-on effects for other business services too. Many technology products aren’t available to international companies, among them Stripe and the capitalization-table management platform Carta. Barrientos said he has heard of VCs who refuse to invest in companies that don’t use Carta, automatically disqualifying companies incorporated abroad. “And there’s no Carta of Brazil,” he said. Stripe, similarly, is not available in any <a href="https://stripe.com/global">African or Latin American countries</a>, although it’s currently being tested in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to obtain the benefits of American incorporation, overseas companies must overcome the hurdles of a complete internal restructuring. The complex endeavor requires companies to perform a corporate “flip,” or inversion, whereby a foreign entity becomes a subsidiary of a Delaware holding company that sits atop the corporate structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Products like Lexgo and Clerky are making things smoother and more affordable for international companies. Even so, Clerky cofounder Darby Wong said he still encourages users to hire a lawyer to avoid small errors that could result in what he refers to as a “runaway chain reaction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because incorporation is expensive — often costing close to $10,000 — many startup founders try to take shortcuts. Mistakes during the process can have deep implications for a company, jeopardizing its intellectual property and even its tax standing back home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, complicated corporate flips and all, incorporating in Delaware remains the price of admission to the global startup market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iyinoluwa Aboyeji is a Nigerian founder of two well-known startups, Andela and Flutterwave. Despite being founded in Nigeria, both were incorporated in Delaware. Aboyeji said he’s not averse to keeping his operations in Nigeria — he sometimes faces prejudice in the U.S. because of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/how-a-forbes-cover-star-stole-millions/">stereotypes</a> about Nigerians. “If [American VCs] were willing to fully fund me, I would incorporate in Nigeria,” Aboyeji said. “You just kind of acquiesce and make it easy for people to deal with you.”</p>



<p>Barrientos said he doesn’t mind that he had to go through Delaware to incorporate. In an ideal world, he would be able to incorporate in whatever country made the most sense for tax purposes, rather than prioritizing where VCs invest. “We are a long way away from that,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I think we’ll probably get there.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

      <p>
        After the analysis of real-world software described above, we randomly
        collected 1,000 generated test cases per open-source target. We ran
        SymQEMU, QSYM and SymCC on each of those inputs, recording the time
        spent in execution and SMT solving, respectively, as per the logging
        output from the QSYM backend.

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

<br/>
January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>
    <span>serverProperties</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>server-port</span> <span>=</span> <span>25565</span><span>;</span>

      <span>enable-rcon</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>

                    <p>Having an agile team is less about the tool you use. It’s more about the people and how your agile team is structured.</p><p>The internet is filled with posts telling you about how agile is great and how everyone should adopt it for their team. But there’s very little information on how to <em>do it</em>. As a result, many teams go through a tiresome journey filled with dead-ends, mistakes, and a series of "<em>this is pointless</em>" frustrated cry.</p><p>After talking to several development teams and helping them streamline their development process with <a href="https://zepel.io/">Zepel</a>, I’ve come across three common team structures.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share with you all three agile team structures, the challenges they cause, and what you can do to improve your team.</p><p>Let’s jump in.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-1-siloed-agile-team">Team Structure #1: Siloed Agile Team</h2><p>Nobody wants a siloed team. However, it’s easy to be trapped by <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/">sprints</a> and <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/daily-scrum-standup/">daily standup meetings</a>, and assume that your team is agile.</p><p>A siloed organization looks a lot like this:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png" alt="Example structure of siloed teams in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 2064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example structure of how siloed teams look like</figcaption></figure><p>For most teams, a siloed structure consists of:</p><ul><li>a dedicate team for the app that involves building all the customer-facing functionalities,</li><li>an operations team that’s responsible for infrastructure and security, and sometimes</li><li>internal tools team that builds special tools for internal use.</li></ul><p><strong>The common problems you’ll encounter in this type of team structure are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>App team vs Operations team:</strong> Both teams can end up becoming frustrated when server allocation becomes a bottleneck for deployment. This is especially common in a fast-growing organization with high customer demand and tight deadlines.<br></li><li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> This can often be seen between all the teams especially if one of them uses a specific language that the other can’t ingest easily. Too much time gets spent on trivial problems and forces teams to employ “<em>workarounds</em>” too often.<br></li><li><strong>Nobody is held accountable for tech debts:</strong> The app team continues to build features as the product manager prioritizes them based on customer requests. But very little importance is given to tech debts and bugs. This hinders the progress of the overall business as the end customer’s experience gets impacted.</li></ol><p><strong>What is the root cause for the problems in a siloed agile team?</strong></p><p>If you look at any organization that has a siloed team structure, you’ll notice the team has a departmental structure. They usually have a set of rigid responsibilities that doesn’t leave any room for cross-functional collaboration.</p><p>This rigid departmental structure can lead to incomplete infrastructure, a steady stream of bugs reported by customers, and functionality gaps that each team thought the other was working on.</p><p>Once your team notices all these problems, they’ll be under immense pressure to perform as quickly as possible because the reported bugs never seem to end. This desire to hit due dates will lead to fewer risks being taken.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-2-matrix-teams">Team Structure #2: Matrix Teams</h2><p>As a result of trying to improve the siloed structure, teams end up with a matrix-like team structure.</p><p>This is how a matrix agile team structure looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of matrix team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1042w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of matrix team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This agile teams structure includes:</p><ul><li>Multiple product teams, each with web developers, backend engineers, UI and UX person, and a scrum master.</li><li>A maintenance team that takes ownership of all services in production and ensured all bugs get squished as they came up.</li><li>An operations team that handles all infrastructure related requests.</li></ul><p>In first glance, you’d think this is a step in the right direction. After all, it solves the majority of the problems a siloed team had.</p><p>There’s a separate team in place that takes ownership of all the debts, product teams can move quickly and ship features faster, and developers worked close to each other with shared goals.</p><p><strong>However, there are still some hidden issues you’ll run into with this team structure.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Getting maintenance team charged up and rally around a common goal becomes harder</strong>. At the end of the day, nobody wants their entire job to be just about the maintenance of someone else’s work.<br></li><li>Since the maintenance team worked on someone else’s work, they will first <strong>have to identify whose work they are fixing</strong> in case they needed help trying to understand the code.<br></li><li>Since everything falls on the maintenance teams in terms of maintaining quality and fixing bugs, it can lead to a <strong>lack of ownership of the quality of code within the product teams</strong>.<br></li><li>With several product teams cranking out one feature after another, <strong>the burden on a single operations team is high</strong>. If not handled carefully, this can lead to infrastructure shortages and higher wait times for product teams to ship.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="team-structure-3-squads-tribes">Team Structure #3: Squads &amp; Tribes</h2><p>You’ve probably heard of the squads and tribe team structure after it was popularized by the folks at Spotify.</p><p>For context, a squad is a group of cross-functional people working together on common product functionality and have one long-term mission. A tribe is a group of squads. If you haven't already, check out their in-depth video about this <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">over here</a>.</p><p>Here’s how it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Spotify-s-Squad-and-Tribe-Team-Structure.png 1327w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of Spotify's Squad + Tribe team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This model enables each squad and tribe to own their roadmap, their code, and their development process. <strong>Here are some advantages of this model over the others:</strong></p><ul><li>It removes the dependency and the need for a maintenance team. Each squad owns their code from feature request to build, deploy, and bug fixes.</li><li>The need for reporting to multiple members is removed since every member works in close proximity to each other with shared goals.</li><li>The role of operations squad is to enable the squads with relevant tools to self-serve and self-deploy. This allows the teams to ship often and make it a routine.</li><li>Infrastructure alerts and needs can be handled by relevant squads themselves since they’re equipped with all the knowledge already and can resolve issues faster.</li></ul><p>Like a scrum team, this model is focussed on being self-organized. This exposes the major disadvantage with this structure — it assumes collaboration as a core competency in members with little to no oversight.</p><p>Besides, when you don’t give it enough thought and consideration, the Spotify model can quickly become the matrix structure with members reporting to multiple people.</p><hr><h2 id="learning-from-the-mistakes-of-other-agile-team-structures">Learning from the mistakes of other agile team structures</h2><p>Of course, there is no silver bullet. However, you can follow some key principles when it comes to building an agile team and putting together a team structure.</p><p><strong>1. Remove or minimize dependencies between teams</strong></p><p>The more dependencies you have between teams, the more processes you’ll have put in place. The can lead to increased wait times, missed deadlines, and frustrations.</p><p>If you begin to see an increase in dependencies between two teams working on critical functions, you should try to empower the team with <a href="https://zepel.io/agile-tools/">agile tools</a> or even consider combining the teams into a squad or a tribe.</p><p><strong>2. Optimize for understanding instead of processes</strong></p><p>When things go sideways or “<em>it doesn’t feel right</em>”, most teams look to impose rigid processes and optimize every interaction. This comes from the assumption that everyone is an expert when it comes to collaboration.</p><p>Instead, it’s better to optimize for understanding. Every person has a unique way of working and grasp information at different levels. Enabling your team to understand all the information at their disposal and the goal needed to achieve can help your team deliver a higher quality of work.</p><p><strong>3. Alignment is essential if you want to give autonomy</strong></p><p>Every team wants autonomy to work the way they want to. It promotes creativity and enables them to do better work. However, autonomy requires greater alignment towards the priorities. And it requires accountability to delivering value in short increments.</p><p><strong>4. Loosely define roles, but hold them accountable to a goal</strong></p><p>The first instinct for growing teams is to define strict roles &amp; responsibilities. It starts with the goal of holding each member accountable.</p><p>Instead of defining strict roles, define them loosely. Often, strict definition brings rigidity and narrows down the team’s focus on one solution. By loosely defining the role, but holding them accountable, it brings flexibility into how they approach problems. And it can lead to long-term wins.</p><hr><p>Forming an agile software development team structure is hard. You could be using any <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/">free kanban software</a> or the most sophisticated <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/scrum-tools/">scrum tool</a>. But without the right team structure that brings together the strengths of your teammates, you'll always end up saying “<em>it doesn't feel right</em>”.</p><p>Of course, you can’t get it right in one shot. You’ll have to experiment a bit, make a few mistakes, and learn a little extra about your team along the way.</p><p>If you’ve been doing this for some time and you’d like to share your knowledge, tweet to us <a href="https://twitter.com/getzepel/">@GetZepel</a>. We’d love to hear your approach!</p>

			<p>The world is becoming more and more aware of privacy and concerns around it. We are trying to limit sharing our personal information online, but how often are we protecting one of our most private information: <strong>our legal address</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="your-address-is-private">Your address is Private</h3>
<p>Think about it, how often do you share your legal address in the world?</p>

<p>From online shopping, to delivery like food, grocery or selling second hand goods in marketplace… how many entities did you share your address with in the last one year? My bad, one year is too long. How about last one month?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your address information is personally identifiable information (Private Information), and shouldn’t be accessible by entities who don’t really need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.pointaddress.com/assets/images/private-address/private-property.jpg">
<em>Your legal address is Private information.</em>
</center>


<p>From group chats, to online portals; from free signups to lucky draws; from resumes to job applications; from facebook marketplace to craigslist we keep sharing our address with strangers on untrusted platforms.</p>

<p>We consistently hear news about data leaks from poorly coded applications that exposed your address to malicious actors. Many online applications sell your legal address information to third parties for profit, or worse knowingly for the purpose of spam, phishing or hijacking your identity online or in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite this, we never we ask ourselves, why are we sharing the most private information with everyone?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is simple: there hasn’t been a platform until now which allowed users to <strong>“create addresses”</strong>. This is a new concept that most of us never thought of, but subconsciously have always wished it existed.</p>

  <p>The concept of “creating a personal address” is something most of us have never thought of, but subconsciously wished it existed.</p>

<p>Point addresses are not legal addresses. They are mapping to a Point in the world named by you. You can create as many Point Addresses as you may want instantly.</p>

<p>You can call the location where you want deliveries as <strong>·happy-home-us·</strong> or <strong>·delivery2me-us·</strong> or anything else of your choice, and Point it precisely to the location in the real world with description and photos if you wish to add.</p>

</center>


<p>When you create a Point Address, you have complete control over it. From updating the Point itself such as changing its name, updating Point’s location, to its visibility (Public or Private), you have full control over your Point Address.</p>

<h3 id="private-protected-and-public-points">Private, Protected and Public Points</h3>
<p>With Point, you can mark your addresses one of the three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: The Point Address is only available to you, and nobody else.</li>
  <li><strong>Protected</strong>: Only those people who know the Point Address, either via link, or by name can search for it in Point Search.</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: Points that are Public show on Explore and can be found by anyone looking for Points in that area. Good example of the Public points are to allow Business and Service Providers to share their location with people looking for the services.</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re in US, Japan or India. You can use Point Address anywhere, anytime for anyone.</p>

<![CDATA[Proper Release Versioning Goes a Long Way]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>Release versioning might seem like a boring topic. Honestly, it should be. There should only be a couple of right ways to do versioning, and each project should pick one of the agreed-upon methods (SemVer<sup id="fnref:semver"><a href="#fn:semver">1</a></sup>, CalVer<sup id="fnref:calver"><a href="#fn:calver">2</a></sup>, etc.) that makes the most sense to the project. We don’t live in this ideal world unfortunately and many projects choose to deviate from versioning standards. I’m not here to say they are wrong, but I’d like to discuss what they might be missing out on.</p>

<p>Along with a typical release version, it is useful to include extra metadata, such as the Git revision, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-build-id-for-firmware">GNU Build ID</a>, build timestamp, and other related items. With all of this in place, both machines and developers can quickly hone in on <em>exactly</em> which release is running on a given device, what the source is, where it came from, and how to rebuild it if necessary.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this article, we are going to talk through all the various pieces of metadata to be included in your firmware binaries, debug symbols, and build artifacts so that developers and machines can quickly and easily know <strong>exactly</strong> which build is which and how to fetch associated files for the debug, test, and release pipeline.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>This post builds upon many of our previous posts and brings all the relevant information together under one post.</p>

<p>Like Interrupt? <a href="https://go.memfault.com/interrupt-subscribe" target="_blank">Subscribe</a> to get our latest posts straight to your mailbox.</p>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Versions don’t exist just to differentiate one release from another. They serve other purposes! Such purposes include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing an ordering to versions (e.g. 1.1 &gt; 1.0)</li>
  <li>Encode compatibility information, breaking changes, and upgrade/downgrade restrictions</li>
  <li>Reference a specific revision of the software</li>
  <li>Reference a specific build of the software</li>
  <li>Tell users when <em>major</em> changes took place (e.g. Windows 8 → Windows 10)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a project chooses to use just a Git SHA, or a build timestamp, or a random ASCII name, then many or all of the above benefits that versions typically provide are lost. We can do better!</p>

<p>Throughout this article, we’ll talk about the various pieces that I believe provide a holistic picture of the software that is packaged into a release and running on a device. First, let’s talk about Semantic Versioning.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</h2>

<p><a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a>, or SemVer for short, is likely the most popular versioning scheme in software today. It was built to solve the versioning story for a single package, but also how a single package interoperates with dependencies.</p>

<p>SemVer uses a sequence of three digits, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and also allows for an optional pre-release tag and build metadata tag. Altogether, a version looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-[pre-release-tag]+[build-meta-tag]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH digits are sorted numerically (1.1.11 &gt; 1.1.10), the pre-release tag is sorted alphanumerically (rc &gt; beta &gt; alpha), and the build-meta-tag is ignored completely when determining sort order or equality (1.1.1+abcd == 1.1.1+efgh). Each should be incremented when the following occurs, according to the spec:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAJOR when you make incompatible API changes</li>
  <li>MINOR when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner</li>
  <li>PATCH when you make backward-compatible bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it might seem pedantic, let’s dig into when a release lead might want to increment each field for a firmware project.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-major">Incrementing MAJOR</h3>

<p>Example: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0</p>

<p>For most firmware projects, the MAJOR field might <em>never</em> be incremented. If I’m writing firmware for an nRF52, and it is the only MCU in my hardware product, it doesn’t have to interact or communicate with many other pieces of software or hardware, so there shouldn’t be any incompatible API changes!</p>

<p>There is one occassion where I would seriously consider incrementing the MAJOR field, and that is when our firmware becomes <strong>incompatible with a version of itself</strong>. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Normal software packages can be updated at any time, with almost no repercussions. If incompatibility arises, just revert the change and continue. However, on firmware devices, the firmware updates itself. If there is an incompatibility, it might require a re-install, a factory reset, or in the worst of cases, the device might be bricked!</p>

<p>With firmware updates, you also can’t expect every device to install every single version (unless that is a hard requirement of the update flow). If you deploy version 1.0.0, version 1.1.0, and version 1.2.0, your firmware should be able to update from 1.0.0 → 1.2.0 and skip 1.1.0 entirely. If a user puts your device in their nightstand and pulls it out 6 months later, this is exactly what should happen.</p>

<p>However, keeping that backward compatibility can weigh down our firmware, especially if we need to keep migration code in our firmware. Migration code adds complexity, code space, and increases our QA test matrix dramatically.</p>

<p>Let’s take the Pebble Smartwatch firmware as an example. The Pebble 2.0.0 firmware was released in early 2014. Over the next year, we released versions all the way up to 2.9.1. Within all of these versions, we were changing <em>a lot</em> of stuff. We changed our file system (from Contiki’s Coffee<sup id="fnref:coffee"><a href="#fn:coffee">3</a></sup> to an internally built one), re-wrote persistent data structures that were stored on internal and external flash, and completely re-architected how we stored our BLE bonding information. All of these things were critical to the functionality of our firmware, and at no point could we lose any of this data.</p>

<p>Despite all of these changes, a user could update directly from 2.0.0 to 2.9.1, and the boot-up sequence on the latter firmware would perform all the migrations (that was quite a long boot-up time).</p>

<p>When we were looking to revamp our firmware for a new product update, we decided to throw out all of the migration code from the 2 years before and move it into a “migration firmware” which users had to update through. With this, our 3.x set of firmwares had a clean slate with no backward-compatibility requirements! It was a breath of fresh air, and our firmware was thousands of lines of code smaller.</p>

<p>This was a backward-incompatible firmware update, and I believe it warranted the MAJOR increase from 2 to 3.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-minor">Incrementing MINOR</h3>

<p>Example: 1.1.0 → 1.2.0</p>

<p>In the context of firmware, this is likely what most of your firmware version updates will be, especially if they contain new features and functionality. A MINOR update means that your device can upgrade from a version with the same MAJOR to any <em>newer</em> version with the same MAJOR. For example, as we discussed in the MAJOR section, any firmware in the 2.x release train should be able to update to any newer 2.x version, such as 2.0.0 → 2.5.0.</p>

<p>A MINOR update does not need to allow downgrading firmware versions, which is going from a firmware version to an older one, such as 2.5 → 2.0. Speaking from experience, this is a nightmare to deal with, and you should disable this behavior from ever happening, <em>at least in production</em>. Allowing downgrades in a limited form on pre-release software will help your developers and QA teams test the upgrade path between two versions more easily.</p>

<p>We provide a <a href="#detecting-downgrades">code snippet</a> later in the article to help prevent against downgrades at the installer level.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-patch">Incrementing PATCH</h3>

<p>Example: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1</p>

<p>On past firmware projects that I’ve worked on, PATCH updates are usually hot-fixes, which are quickly tested and released after a critical bug is discovered upon releasing a prior firmware update. Each patch-fix might fix one or two bugs, and the amount of time needed to test and verify that the firmware works can be minimized.</p>

<p>Ideally, nothing that should prevent a downgrade from occurring should be placed in a patch upgrade. This means no persistent data structure changes, no migration paths, and no changes in how the device communicates with external devices or services.</p>

<p>Since there are minimal to no breaking changes, these firmware updates can be upgraded and downgraded to without harm.</p>

<h3 id="pre-release-tag-best-practices">Pre-release Tag Best Practices</h3>

<p>The pre-release tag is any series of dot separated identifiers consisting of ASCII letters and numbers.</p>

<p>The most common pre-release tags are ‘alpha’, ‘beta’, and ‘rc’, which should satisfy most of your versioning requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use ‘alpha’ when the release branch is first cut from master or another release branch. It’s pretty much assumed that ‘alpha’ builds are unstable and should be treated as broken-by-default.</li>
  <li>Use ‘beta’ when the API is stable, there are no longer any breaking changes and features being pushed into the release, and the stabilization phase has begun.</li>
  <li>Use ‘rc’ (release-candidate) when you think everything is stable and QA should start doing rigorous testing because it might turn out that this build could be “the one”.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve seen many developers create out-of-order pre-release tags, so be sure to <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-11" target="_blank">read the spec</a> and test your assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="scripting-and-testing-semver">Scripting and Testing SemVer</h3>

<p>In all of my scripts that parse SemVer and when I need to quickly test version comparisons, I turn to the <a href="https://github.com/python-semver/python-semver" target="_blank">python-semver</a> package.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pip install semver
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; semver.parse_version_info('1.1.1-alpha.1') \
    &lt; semver.parse_version_info('1.1.1-alpha.11')
True
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="missing-pieces-of-semantic-versioning">Missing Pieces of Semantic Versioning</h3>

<p>Semantic Versioning provides a plethora of benefits to our firmware and release management workflows, but it doesn’t solve all of our requirements. One of our requirements was to be able to reference a specific build of a firmware, which SemVer does not help with.</p>

<p>For example, if two developers locally compile a “1.1.1” firmware, we now have two builds of “1.1.1” with no way to tell the difference between the two! They could be based upon two entirely different revisions of software or even built with a different compiler. We could use pre-release tags or build meta tags, but we also don’t want to pollute our SemVer string with data that could be better solved by other versions.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at Git revisions, which will help us identify the software revisions that our firmware is built from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

			<p>2020 might be the year we all faced a pandemic. But 2019 was the year the earth burned. In Australia, the world watched in horror as bushfires destroyed&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048891/australia-wildfires-koalas-climate-change-bushfires-deaths-animals-damage">10.3 million hectares</a></span><span>25.5 million acres</span></span>, marking the continent’s most intense and destructive fire season in over 40 years. Earlier that fall, California saw more than&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/business/the-2019-california-wildfires-caused-less-damage-than-the-last-two-devastating-seasons/643455">101,000 hectares</a></span><span>250,000 acres</span></span> </p>
<p> destroyed, with damages upward of $80 billion. Alaska saw nearly <a href="https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/02/26/wildfire-activity-in-2019-was-heavier-than-usual-in-alaska-but-slower-than-average-in-rest-of-u-s/">a million</a>. Record-breaking fires also hit&nbsp;<a href="http://silicamag.com/features/peat-in-heat">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2019/huge-wildfires-in-russias-siberian-province-continue">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/hellish-scenes-wildfires-engulf-lebanon-191015191252866.html">Lebanon</a>—but nowhere saw the sheer mass of media coverage as the fires that tore through the Amazon nearly all last summer.</p>
<p>By year’s end, thousands of global media outlets had reported that Brazil’s largest rainforest played host to more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/world/americas/amazon-fires-bolsonaro-photos.html">80,000 individual forest fires</a> in one year alone, resulting in an estimated <span><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-wildfires-brazil-spurns-20-million-aid-offer-from-g-7-nations-today-2019-08-27/">906,000 square hectares</a></span><span>2.2 million acres</span></span> of environmental destruction. At the time, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research <a href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal-static/situacao-atual/">reported</a> it was the fastest rate of burning since record keeping began in 2013.</p>
<p>But amid the charred ruins of one of the largest oxygen-producing environments on the planet, a secret lies buried beneath the soil. A complex network of seeds, scat, fungi and fertilizers are already hard at work creating the next generation of tropical regeneration. We are racing to reverse-engineer the rainforest—and like any half-decent architect, we’re going to have to do it from the ground up.</p>
<section>
	<p><em>Silica</em>, Define Reverse-engineer</p>
	<p><em>verb</em> A process by which an object or system is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture and concepts within, then rebuilt into something similar with our current level of technology.</p>
</section>
<p>This year, deforestation seems imminent. In January 2020, humans cleared <span><span><a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/deforestation-in-brazil-continues-torrid-pace-into-2020/">284 kilometers</a></span><span>176 acres</span></span> of rainforest in the Amazon, more than twice that registered in January 2019. The risk was compounded by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/brazil-bolsonaro-commercial-mining-indigenous-land-bill">February 2020 announcement</a> by President Jair Bolsonaro of a bill he'd sent to Brazil’s Congress that would further open up indigenous reserves in the Amazon to commercial mining, oil and gas exploration, cattle ranching, agribusiness, hydroelectric dam projects, and tourism. By May, deforestation had increased by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-brazil-amazon-rainforest-destruction/">more than 50%</a> across the region, actually intensifying in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as illegal loggers and miners rushed in to subsidize their incomes. It’s no secret in Brazil that&nbsp;many believe for their country to prosper, the Amazon will have to burn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With software, taking something apart and putting it back together again can help engineers improve their understanding of the underlying source code of their software. In structural engineering, the same methods can determine the cause of potentially fatal design flaws. Reverse-engineering is also useful in medical and scientific research, like with the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">Human Genome project</a>, where researchers try to decipher human DNA to discover more about how we work as a species.</p>
<p>Locked in a race against time, politics, and climate change, the ways in which we might be able to reverse-engineer and recover our rainforests might surprise even the most stoic of environmental theorists.</p>
<hr>

<p>The first step in reverse-engineering anything is to develop a shared language. What can we agree on? What are the risks? What are the goals? How can we apply quantitative properties to qualitative phenomena so we can measure and track our results? Those are the questions a new generation of rainforest researchers, using complex computational models are asking themselves as they begin to map the past and future of the Amazon.</p>
<p>“When it comes to computational modeling, the most useful role is to enable us to simulate different kinds of futures,” says <a href="https://environment.harvard.edu/about/faculty/paul-moorcroft">Paul Moorcroft</a>, an ecologist at Harvard University who has published a series of groundbreaking studies on the ecological dynamics of terrestrial plant communities and ecosystems around the world. “We can look at all sorts of different scenarios, for example land use management, or enforcement of fire codes and see how much potential wilding you would get versus destruction under different scenarios.”</p>
<p>These <a href="https://moorcroftlab.oeb.harvard.edu/publications/mechanistic-scaling-ecosystem-function-and-dynamics-space-and-time">potential futures</a>, which essentially range from “It’ll be okay” to “The Amazon will turn into a literal grassland by 2050,” are hotly debated in the rainforest research community. One thing researchers can all agree on, however, is that the Amazon burning is not a natural phenomena. </p>
<p>Unlike other forests––many of which go through a natural cycle of wetting, drying, and sometimes fire––the Amazon is home to one of the wettest ecosystems on earth. Despite the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-fires-brazil-president-bolsonaro-misinformation-cbsn-originals-documentary/">misinformation campaign</a> perpetuated by Bolsonaro and the Brazilian government, the Amazon’s fires aren’t  the result of some stray kindling or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/12/disinformation-and-lies-are-spreading-faster-than-australias-bushfires">environmental activism gone wrong</a>; they’re largely the result of systematic extraction by logging, mining, ranching and agriculture companies that slash and burn the forest to make way for business.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16512">effects on the forest floor</a>, mapped by both human hands and digital models, are devastating. With trees gone, nutrients wash away and the soil degrades into a dense, brick-like layer inhospitable to many plant roots. Without native shrubs or trees, symbiotic soil organisms die, further decreasing fertility. Heavy rains and intense sunlight at the equator leach nutrients from the soil, tripling the impact. Animal species crucial to pollination, seed processing, and seed dispersal disappear.</p>
<p>“It really only takes a couple of those events and the forest will basically just die,” says Moorcroft. Models show that in the years after a major burn, damaged root systems open up even the most resilient, 1000-year-old canopies to erosion, wind damage, pathogens, and termites. “Those large trees simply won’t survive.”</p>
<p>Computer models, fed by field observations, remote sensing, and increasingly sophisticated satellite, microwave and LiDAR data, also show us how climate change could affect the rainforest and vice versa, helping to align researchers and organizations on a common goal as they race to regrow what’s been lost. For example, they’re doing whatever it takes to achieve the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/methodology/paris-temperature-goal/">1.5 to 2.0 degree Celsius</a> temperature targets established by the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> and pushing to stop the current rate of rainforest destruction that releases an estimated <span><span><a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/why-forests-why-now-preview-science-economics-politics-tropical-forests-climate-change">9.7 billion metric tons</a></span><span>10.8 billion tons</span></span> of carbon into the atmosphere in the process.</p>
<p>As for the worst-case scenario, Moorcroft is not hedging his bets. “The question is, does it get warmer or wetter or warmer or dryer? If the answer is warm and dry, that’s when you tend to get devastating impacts.”</p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL030612#grl23422-fig-0002">2007 projection</a> found that if the Amazon reaches about 40 percent of forest converted into pastureland, the eastern Amazon could see a nearly 20 percent decrease in rainfall. <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaat2340.short">More recent studies</a> argue that this level of devastation could happen with as little as 20 to 25 percent deforestation. The potential result of that is a phenomena known as savannization, characterized by drastic changes in vegetation structure, soil aridity, and canopy coverage that computer models predict could unalterably transform the rainforest into a much more open ecosystem in the future.</p>
<p>This race against time, predicted by several climate models, is now beginning to see its first biological evidence as well. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2530064419300525">A 2019 study</a> published in <em>Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation</em> found that abandoned pastures affected by fires in the Brazilian Atlantic showed similarities in vegetation structure and plant functional traits to a savanna-like ecosystem––traits predicted to significantly impair its recovery. </p>
<p>“Ongoing climate change is likely to exacerbate the observed savannization and indicate that its transformation into savanna-like might be a matter of time,” study authors wrote. “A time that would be particularly short under the most likely climate scenarios.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, scientists on the ground are learning more than ever about what it takes to regenerate a rainforest from the ground up. Just as an architect might begin by studying the basic material units required to create a structure, many researchers in the Amazon are starting simply, then adding complexity in a mind-numbingly difficult endeavor to figure out the basic building blocks of Amazonian ecology –– the second step in any reverse-engineering process worth its salt.</p>
<p>Since this is <a href="https://silicamag.com/issues/dirt">the Dirt Issue</a>, it should come as no surprise that this part of the story starts in the soil. Back in the 15th century, when early colonists first set foot in Latin America, they believed that the incredible lushness of the rainforests was due to their super-fertile soils. In fact, over two-thirds of the world’s rainforests are considered “<a href="https://inesad.edu.bo/developmentroast/2012/11/five-types-of-rainforest-ecosystem-services-that-nourish-people-and-planet/">wet deserts</a>”––inhospitable to even the most hardy of plant pioneers. </p>
<p>The reason for this lies within the rapid nutrient cycle within the rainforest, where decaying matter like dead wood, leaf litter, fecal matter and even human perspiration are recycled back into the carbon chain so efficiently there’s not much left by the time it gets to the ground. The abundance of bacteria, fungi and insects that call the Amazon home are critical to young growth, leaching out minerals like potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. The high temperature and moisture of the rainforest also cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose more quickly, further enhancing nutrient degradation. As a result, most rainforest plants are incredibly shallow-rooted, perfectly adapted to take advantage of the thin, nutrient-rich compost layer that makes up the first <span><span>15-20 centimeters</span><span>6-8 inches</span></span> of the rainforest floor. </p>
<p>How to tap into this complex, precarious ecosystem and reverse-engineer it is a monumental task, one that thousands of scientists around the world are trying to tackle. One of the most compelling of these projects is happening at the <a href="https://stri.si.edu/">Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</a> in Panama, where researchers have access to a <span><span>700-hectare</span><span>1,700 acre</span></span> open air laboratory with conditions that parallel the Amazon.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many discussions around edge computing and its adoption scenarios. One of the key ingredients that could accelerate edge transformation is the ability to use an existing software stack for continuous deployment to the edge. We believe that a new type of hardware that can organically coexist with the cloud ecosystem could be a solution to address the challenge. For example, Turing Pi designed to be an edge computer with cloud-native hardware architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of processing data closer to the source isn’t new. Though, the opportunities that Kubernetes as well as machine learning open to it sound more promising than ever.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>It is doubtful that edge computing is going to replace the cloud. More likely, the edge is going to be an extension. That’s why the synergy of these two paradigms is empirical.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>Cloud computing has spawned many cloud-native solutions. Technologies like containers, serverless, Kubernetes changed the way developers build, deliver, and scale software. What all these technologies have in common is that they designed for distributed computing. The idea behind Turing Pi is a cluster of computers interconnected with Ethernet but all in one compact device. This architecture allows deploying and scaling software to the edge in the same way as in the cloud.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>The concept of a cluster board is similar to a PC motherboard but with an Ethernet network instead of a PCI bus. Rather than using just one processor, the cluster board can combine multiple processors and multiple types of processors. As an example, general-purpose compute modules can work in combination with machine learning modules. This heterogeneous approach could open a wider adaptation of machine learning applications at the edge.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>In other words, Turing Pi is a compact, energy-efficient, out of the box RACK system. These characteristics allow placing clusters in various locations, hard to reach places, and build things like mobile data centers. <a href="https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A striking example of cluster computing</a> adoption is the Chick-Fil-A restaurant chain. The company placed local Kubernetes clusters in more than two thousand restaurants. That helped Chick-Fil-A to build a resilient, highly available, internet-independent system. As a result, the company automated critical business processes and reduced public cloud load by processing data locally. The possibility of using cloud-native technologies at the edge helped Chick-Fil-A to accelerate innovations and get the code running in production as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Turing Pi V1 model is mostly aimed at developers, Devops and researchers. It is an amazing platform for learning and experimentation. The cluster board currently supports Raspberry Pi compute modules, which are intended for industrial applications. Raspberry Pi, by far, is the most popular single-board computer, and its colossal software ecosystem should help to lower entry points for new developers.&nbsp;Bare metal cluster using Raspberry Pis and running on Linux is not only affordable compared to what it can do, but can also be a great tool when dealing with resource-intensive tasks like compiling, continuous data parsing, or learning how to manage a cluster using real hardware instead of virtual machines. Also, it is very useful to have a personal Kubernetes cluster to explore concepts of distributed systems, create proof of concept prototypes, and deploy self-hosted services on-premises or at the edge with almost zero recurring costs.</p><p>Yes, we believe that compact clusters and edge computing is a great fit. Compact clusters could be great building blocks for edge infrastructure. It’s easy to scale within one mini cluster and within the whole fleet of clusters. Different cluster nodes intended for different type of applications, which is a more reliable and efficient way to run services. At the same time container orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it easy to monitor, maintain and deliver software.</p></div></div>]]>

The company will retain its Canadian headquarters.</p>  <p>"This is the most important day in the history of the company and an incredible milestone," said Allen Lau, one of Wattpad's co-founders, in an interview.</p>  <p>"It is the beginning of a new chapter and using TV show terminology, this is episode one of season two, so I'm absolutely looking forward to this."</p>    <p>Lau and Ivan Yuen, who will continue to lead Wattpad following the sale, started the self-publishing platform after the pair dreamed up the idea on a napkin while waiting for a flight at the Vancouver airport food court in 2006.</p>  <p>Wattpad quickly became home to stories from dozens of genres because it allows anyone to share their writing for free and is accessible on phones and tablets.</p>  <p>It became a household name around 2013 when Anna Todd, a Texas woman, started writing <em>After</em>,&nbsp;a fanfiction series on the platform about One Direction singer Harry Styles.</p>  <p>Her stories were eventually made into books and a film series, which encouraged Wattpad to start book publishing and studio entertainment divisions.</p>  <p>However, Lau admitted a sale wasn't always his plan.</p>  <p>"We weren't actively looking for sellers, but we have been talking to investors along the way …&nbsp;to accelerate our growth," he said.</p>  <p>"We knew Naver for quite some time and we realized after some conversations we have a shared vision."</p>  <h2>Opportunity to grow, get into animation, co-founder says</h2>  <p>Naver, which bills itself as "South Korea's largest web search engine," was an ideal partner because it owns digital comics platform Webtoon, he said.</p>  <p>Webtoon is behind some of the biggest names in webcomics, including <em>Lore Olympus</em>,&nbsp;and has worked with the Jim Henson Company and producers behind hit films like <em>The Lego Movie</em>, the <em>It&nbsp;</em>franchise and <em>Snowpiercer</em>.</p>  <p>Lau said Naver will offer Wattpad a chance to get into animation and to grow beyond the 90 million users — including more than five million writers — that Wattpad has. Webtoon said it has more than 72 million monthly active users.</p>  <p>"Wattpad's vision to entertain and connect the world through stories fits perfectly with our vision for Webtoon and Naver's content brand and we're thrilled to have them join the Naver family," Seong-sook Han, chief executive, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of Wattpad's fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>  <p>It is the latest in a string of sales that have seen once-promising Canadian tech companies snatched up by foreign owners during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>Element AI, a Montreal-based firm that creates artificial intelligence solutions for large organizations, signed a deal in November to be purchased by ServiceNow, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that offers a cloud-based workflow technology.</p>  <p>San Francisco-based "buy now, pay later" company Affirm reached a deal to buy Toronto rival PayBright for $340 million in early December.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Not many websites make it the age of twenty-five. Today, let’s recognize <a href="http://www.pencilpages.com/" target="_blank">The Pencil Pages</a>, one of the first websites devoted to the woodcase pencil. Author Doug Martin created a website with articles, an often cited (and still not surpassed) directory of pencil manufacturers, photos of pencils, and a classified section. </p>
<p>The classified section at Pencil Pages (still going) was the first online place I’m aware that fostered a basic conversation about pencils, with posters speaking to one another.</p>
<p>Congratulations on this significant anniversary.</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

Get a sense of what it was like for Jack; and if you are a struggling creator, I hope this will also provide you with the motivation to keep going. Let’s dive in.</p><p><em>Because of the sheer amount of visuals that Jack uses, this post is best viewed in your browser.</em></p><h2 id="the-early-years">The Early Years</h2><p>Jack graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2010, worked at multiple agencies till 2017, then started his own <a href="https://work.opponentco.com/">agency</a>. He got burnt out, then <a href="https://youtu.be/bwBYNQGiOXo">iterated on the agency model till he landed on Visualize Value</a>.</p><p>🗓 Jan 11 2019: Jack announces The Trust Accelerator. This is Jack's first project to 'automate' aspects of the agency model- he wanted to create efficient processes for the onboarding process of the agency's clients, instead of reinventing the wheel for each of them. At this point, Jack is already thinking of creating systems for his workflow. If you are currently involved in providing a service, it will be extremely helpful to think if you can productize part of that service/workflow. This is exactly the same tactic that Jack used for Visualize Value's Daily Manifest, as we shall see in the later part of this article.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Take more on, get duller.⁣<br>Take more off, get sharper.⁣<a href="https://t.co/fyaLM1dTGa">https://t.co/fyaLM1dTGa</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8bjmhcjMB">pic.twitter.com/P8bjmhcjMB</a></p>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1083397948216627200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 Jan 19 2019: 8 days later, there was Visualize Value's first Tweet (2 retweets, 9 likes). Jack essentially ran two concurrent experiments- The Trust Accelerator and Visualize Value. The latter is meant to be an evolution of the former- while The Trust Accelerator still needed the physical presence of the agency's staff, Visualize Value productizes the whole process of content creation, and allows clients to do so asynchronously.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">— <a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@naval</a> <a href="https://t.co/sU6uXafWuY">pic.twitter.com/sU6uXafWuY</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1086488889315991552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Jack has a very interesting approach to productizing- instead of thinking of a single product, he launches several products at once, which allows him to capture different points on the scale of automation. If your goal is point e, you can always start by launching products on points a and b, then slowly progress towards your goal as you get better at the scale you choose to improve your products on.</p><p>🗓 January 22 2019: Jack's output with VV is stunning- he creates 3-5 visualizations a day. In addition, he did not just focus on a single person's thoughts and quotes. Instead, he covered a wide range of individuals, ranging from Seth Godin to Nassim Taleb, and of course, Naval.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">— <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ThisIsSethsBlog</a> <a href="https://t.co/bPauMwp81p">pic.twitter.com/bPauMwp81p</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1087413490506178560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Because he tags each of these individuals, he is increasing his reach to fans of each individual. These fans may be non-overlapping, thus increasing his efficiency in building VV's brand.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg 678w"></figure><p>🗓 May 19 2019: Jack has been quieter on VV's front. There was only one tweet from February 2019 to September 2019 period. While there was more likes (34) on this tweet, this is still very few compared to his current tweets which can get a few thousand likes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Feed" <a href="https://t.co/x4Ok2HyV3G">pic.twitter.com/x4Ok2HyV3G</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1129883797644824576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>(cont) Jack will be a lot quieter on Visualize Value's Twitter feed for the next few months for good reason-</p><p>🗓 May 23 2019: Jack launched his own Substack, aptly named Visualize Value. It is clear that he sees that VV can go beyond simply being a Twitter account that puts out graphics- instead, he wishes to expand into different forms of media, such as newsletters, audio content and YouTube videos. His own Substack can also serve as the platform for those different forms of media, such as:</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMfB_M6OaWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>(cont) As you build your own personal brand, it is important to consider which platforms you can use to best serve the type of media you have in mind.</p><p>Jack mixes things up by using his Twitter to build a following for Visualize Value (by leveraging on already famous people) → creating a Substack that holds written and video content → allowing for older videos (like the one above) to be (re)discovered.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 1031w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In short, there is synergy between the various forms of media and products that he is creating. If you are building some piece of media that just isn't getting the attention that you think it deserves, do not dump them into the trash can. Instead, think of how they can be re-marketed and discovered in the future. Media is an awesome tool for indie hackers because of the short iteration cycles- use them wisely. Look for demand from consumers, and once you've built up your audience, you can funnel them to your older projects.</p><p>Over the next few months, Jack will be extremely active on Substack, posting various articles explaining his graphics, and recording audio content.</p><p>🗓 May 29, 2020: '11 months, $0.' A post from Jack that summarizes Visualize Value thus far. </p><figure><a href="https://visualizevalue.substack.com/p/stay-the-course"><div><p>Stay the course</p><p>Here’s an illustration from yesterday, inspired by experience building the Visualize Value business: 11 months, $0.330 days.Thousands of hours staring into a screen.Was it worth it?

If not, iterate, iterate, iterate.</p><p>🗓 October 4 2019: Jack resumed frequent postings on Visualize Value. While the posts have higher engagement, they are still not wildly popular.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">WMD <a href="https://t.co/frr4iXaFsT">pic.twitter.com/frr4iXaFsT</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1179910292559597569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 September 6 2019: Jack released a simple document that he uses himself to keep track of his own goals and habits. </p><figure><a href="https://visualizevalue.substack.com/p/an-idiot-with-a-plan"><div><p>An Idiot with a Plan</p><p>“An idiot with a plan can beat a genius without a plan.” — Warren Buffet Without a plan, I act like an idiot.

While it is true that the newsletter is the <em>main</em> product, newsletter writers often confuse it for the <em>only</em> product. Imagine if we entice people to subscribe like how magazines offer subscription gifts.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 1469w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>🗓 November 29 2019: It is the one year anniversary of Visualize Value. Jack still has not made significant money, neither does he have any 'best-selling' products. I am highlighting this as it is important to see how other successful creators/indie hackers struggle, and know that this is often part of the journey.</p><p>Jack offered the print edition of Visualize Value for sale (which has been discontinued).</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Untitled.png 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Untitled.png 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled.png 1456w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While it is unclear what the exact reason is for Jack discontinuing this product, he soon launched another product that will prove to provide much higher ROI and easier distribution-</p><p>🗓 December 16 2019: Jack launched the VV Daily Manifest at an affordable price of $19. This is his first foray into digital products, and it probably opened his eyes to the ease and profitability of such products.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 1512w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There are 3 takeaways from the launch of VV's Daily Manifest:</p><ol><li>Digital products are great for indie hackers who do not necessarily have the capital for physical goods, and for solopreneurs who do not have the time to handle administrative work (e.g. shipping of goods).</li><li>Iterate the product/service that you are offering! It took only about 2 weeks for Jack to offer a new product (from the previous print version of VV). The more (high quality) products you put out there, the more you can test the market demand.</li><li>Leverage on the knowledge and workflows that you already have. Similar to Janel Loi's <a href="https://newsletteros.com/">Newsletter OS</a>, VV Daily Manifest probably grew out of the workflow that Jack already possessed. There is no need to create a product from scratch, you can ask yourself- what is some workflow that you have managed to synthesize over the years? Even if you are unsure if there will be demand for your idiosyncratic knowledge, it does not hurt to put it out there and gauge interest.</li></ol><p>This concludes the first chapter of Jack Butcher's Visualize Value- how he started his project from scratch, to landing on his first digital product that will shift his whole focus. At this point, Jack likely has not made much money from this project. But, he has laid the foundations for Visualize Value to soar.</p><p>Subscribe to receive updates on the release of the next installment- we are going to explore how Jack expanded on his arsenal of digital products, and started becoming extremely profitable.</p><p>Give Their Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/their_timeline">a shout out on Twitter</a> if there is any entrepreneur whom you'll like to be featured too.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97642.No_More_Mr_Nice_Guy">No More Mr. Nice Guy</a> a couple weeks ago and I can’t decide if it was life changing or sexist pseudoscientific garbage. At the moment I’m thinking it’s a little bit of both.</p>



<p>But one concept hit home for me: <em>covert contracts</em>. The idea is that “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">Nice Guys</a>” (and of course there are “Nice Gals” too, but the book is written for men) aren’t all that nice. They’re playing the part so that they’ll get <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/24/jobs-to-be-done-is-a-terrible-name/">what they want</a>. They think:</p>



<blockquote><p>IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be<br>THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.</p><cite>Robert A. Glover, No More Mr. Nice Guy</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is called a covert contract. <em>If I do X, then you’ll do Y, even though neither of us have acknowledged it.</em> Of course, the other person <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">has no idea</a> this is happening; it’s all in <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">the Nice Guy’s head</a>. So the Nice Guy doesn’t get what he wants.</p>



<p>And this isn’t just your average everyday implicit expectation. In this case, the Nice Guy feels like he’s been cheated. He thinks the other person owes him and didn’t hold up their end of the bargain (which they didn’t know existed). So he ends up disappointed and frustrated, which manifests in <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">not-at-all-nice behavior</a>: passive aggression, isolation, clinginess, rage, all sorts of stuff.</p>



<p>The book talked a lot about relationships and sex (“if I am loving and giving towards my wife all day then she’ll have sex with me tonight”). But now that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">it has a name</a>, I notice it everywhere:</p>



<ul><li>Work: “If I review your code quickly then you’ll make it a priority to review mine.”</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">Parenting</a>: “If we do a fun craft then you won’t pitch a hissy fit when I say no candy afterwards.”</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">Friendships</a>: “If I don’t make fun of your weight then you won’t make fun of my height.”</li></ul>



<p>The punchline is that <strong>everyone would be <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happier</a> if the Nice Guy would <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/05/respond-to-vulnerability-with-vulnerability/">just ask</a> for what he wants.</strong> </p>



<p>I’ve talked before about how <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">being clear is scary</a>, and how a lot of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">my actions are avoidance based</a>. In the spirit of my 2021 theme of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">Year Of Courage</a>, this introduction to covert contracts has given me a new <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/23/2020-my-year-of-mantras/">mantra</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Just say it.</strong></p>



<p>Death to covert contracts. Ask for what you want. Clear is kind, unclear is unkind. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">Just say it</a>.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post started as a few simple sentences for my brother; tips on how to lose fat and manage blood sugar better. I decided to write them down as a reminder to myself, or anyone, especially those in middle age, as I’m starting the year with a health drive.</p>

<p>The golden triad is simple: <em>optimise your sleep, diet and activeness.</em></p>

<p>Consider this as 10 years of research simplified into a blog post. If knowledge was the answer we’d all be millionaires with six pack abs – lifestyle change is the only way.</p>

<p>Setting up for success: I recommend a few links throughout this, before reading I’d start with: <a href="https://youtu.be/qHUFgFYdJck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behaviour/Environment Design</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your diet is not only what you eat.</p>

  <p>It is what you watch, what you listen to, what you read, the people you hang around.</p>

  <p>Be mindful of the things you put into your body emotionally, spiritually and physically.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This one is fairly obvious, simply put, sleep restores body and mind, so try to improve your quality of sleep.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes we think we’re hungry when were really tired.</p>

<p>The book: Why We Sleep by Mathew Walker  <br>
The hack:  Try and sleep 8 hours every night, ideally at the same time, even on weekends. Don’t drink caffeine after midday. Avoid alcohol? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOaSWPROOxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five tips</a></p>


<p>I’ve always had success shedding a few pounds following the Slow Carb Diet; evolved or created by Tim Ferriss in The Four Hour Body. This is my go-to approach, as a bonus I also truly feel it’s <em>anti-inflammatory</em> effects.</p>

<p><em>I like it because at it’s core it’s about simplicity, no white food (bread/rice/pasta), no processed food (i.e. no sugar), so it really encourages you to eat home cooked <strong>whole foods</strong>.</em></p>

<p>There is a tonne of information online about what is involved:</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.williamhertling.com/2011/02/4-hour-body-fat-loss-cheat-sheet_27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheat sheet</a> or an <a href="http://www.fitnessinfographics.com/diets-4-hour-body-slow-carb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infograhic</a>.</p>

<p>I also believe in the health benefits of Time Restricted Feeding; due to a book called The Circadian Code, here’s an excellent intro/overview by the author: <a href="https://youtu.be/t0NI0jELuF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Satchin Panda - Daily Rythms</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lifestyle is what, WHEN and how much we Eat, Sleep, and Move on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My preference is to exercise/workout, or go for a walk, in the morning, before eating. I will drink water or black coffee, then tend to start eating around midday, I try not to eat at night (after 9:30). Meaning a 9-10 hour feeding window, giving my digestion a break. If an option, I would also swim and sauna in the evening.</p>

<p>I think calorie density/food satiety (feeling full) can play there parts (for example, eating enough so as not to snack, or starting meals with soups or veggies/salads): <a href="https://youtu.be/0CdwWliv7Hg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calorie Density: How To Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer</a></p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>whenever you break fast, start with a slow carb/high protein meal.</li>
  <li>Hydrate (2 litres water per day), don’t drink calories and have a day off (cheat day).</li>
  <li>Take pictures on your phone of everything you put in your mouth (for a week).</li>
  <li>Or log everything in myfitnesspal. (what gets measured gets managed).</li>
</ul>


<p>A complex and debatable topic, as there are many variables; types of exercise, what we can sustain/enjoy, our age, our ability to recover, etc.</p>

<p><em>For this goal, the idea is simple, do activities that keep our metabolism in fat burning mode</em>.</p>

<p>I believe we’re burning fat when in a calorie deficit (consuming less calories than we use). Muscle is denser/heavier than fat, building muscle means we use more calories to move, which means burning fat (our goal). Also, as we age we suffer from muscle atrophy (loss), so if we don’t build new muscle, we’re getting slowly weaker. “Use it or lose it, baby!”</p>

<p>As the saying goes, you can’t outrun a bad diet. Whilst running/swimming/cycling/yoga/pilates are great exercise for our health/heart/cardio, it isn’t the optimum way to burn fat, as they don’t build as much muscle.</p>

<p>Lifting weights, which also stimulates the heart and builds muscle, includes lifting our own bodyweight, so we can start with simple push-up/pull-ups, air squats, then perhaps progress to kettlebells/dumbbells. High Intensity Interval Training is an excellent way to kickstart the metabolism and continue fat burning for a few hours (some call it the afterburn effect), but this is probably true of many exercises.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a quick/light HIIT circuit/session using weights (time-lapse, 45 sec each exercise, 15 sec rest, x3 rounds): <a href="https://youtu.be/jdV_td3OJg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT session</a></p>

<p>Also, walking is an excellent recovery tool, great to keep the fire going and burn calories…</p>

<p>Ideally, in time, we would combine compound strength training (e.g. squats/deadlifts, to stop muscle atrophy) with some weighted HIIT classes (2-3 x per week), then some other general recovery exercises throughout the week (like walking/swimming).</p>

<p>N.B. An important point to remember is to fuel our body correctly, to optimise the benefits of whatever type of training protocol we follow. I try to balance this a slow carb (25%), medium fat(40%), high protein(35%), if possible.</p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>do as many wall push-ups, pull-ups (start on a chair), air squats, just before and 90 mins after meals, as you can (consider <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?&amp;q=negative+pull+ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressions</a>)</li>
  <li>Replace car journeys with walking or cycling (great for the bank balance too)</li>
</ul>


<p>Putting on fat doesn’t happen overnight, neither does fat loss, or composition changes. Consistency over the long term is the key.  If you crack and have a tasty treat, or a day off exercise, make sure to enjoy it and start over the next day. James Clear has an excellent mindset/approach “I try to never miss two in a row”.</p>

<p>It’s not all about what you put in your mouth, keep active, and sleep well. Remember, losing anything from 1-2 pounds of fat per week really is winning.</p>

<p>The book(s): The Slight Edge/Atomic Habits  <br>
The hack: Simple, small and satisfying daily positive choices that move you in the right direction. Picture yourself winning, try to track how often you are choosing to take that action/behaviour, and enjoy all the small wins.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein is reputed to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And I’m still a fat b*st*rd</em>…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a&nbsp;declaration of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new era.</p>
<p>Cryptography was almost exclusively a&nbsp;military technology for&nbsp;centuries. When in&nbsp;1990s millions of&nbsp;personal computers connected to&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet, cryptography graduated from a&nbsp;munition to&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial tool to&nbsp;secure credit card payments over a&nbsp;global, open and&nbsp;hostile environment.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;next 20 years cryptographic research and&nbsp;engineering was very vibrant, but&nbsp;culminating in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loud confirmation by&nbsp;Edward Snowden that the&nbsp;<b>resulting products were not&nbsp;good enough</b>. SSL, PGP and&nbsp;other protocols turned out to&nbsp;be insecure, their implementations were buggy and&nbsp;hard maintain, all cryptographic primitives are broken and/or&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;misuse (MD5, RC4, RSA). High-level protocols were full of&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering mistakes and&nbsp;full of&nbsp;misunderstandings. The&nbsp;whole discipline had a&nbsp;culture of&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=47m58s">abstinence-only cryptography</a> and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, poor engineering standards mixed with academic hubris and&nbsp;sabotage by&nbsp;the&nbsp;governments. 20 years of&nbsp;real-world cryptography produced a&nbsp;few useful artifacts and&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>Then, three things started to&nbsp;happen:</p>
<p>First, <b>personal computers and&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet reached very deep into lives of&nbsp;almost everyone</b>. Individuals now store their entire life in&nbsp;affordable pocket computers, businesses run all their operations over the&nbsp;internet, governments routinely participate in&nbsp;cyberwars. The&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;securing information shifted from “good to&nbsp;have” to&nbsp;“actively desirable”. Apple, the&nbsp;most valuable corporation on&nbsp;Earth, is selling billions of&nbsp;computers with _security_ and&nbsp;_privacy_ as&nbsp;a&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their main selling points.</p>
<p>Second, <b>Bitcoin and&nbsp;blockchains happened</b>. Things envisioned by&nbsp;Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, Wei Dai, Tim May and&nbsp;other cypherpunks back in&nbsp;1990s finally started to&nbsp;materialize. The&nbsp;internet discovered a&nbsp;whole new continent: with “wild west” anarchy, “gold rushes”, and&nbsp;massive real and&nbsp;fictional opportunities. On&nbsp;that continent the&nbsp;excellence in&nbsp;cryptography is no&nbsp;longer simply desirable, but&nbsp;becomes vitally important: the&nbsp;unauthorized access to&nbsp;data now equates to&nbsp;the&nbsp;immediate loss of&nbsp;unbounded amount of&nbsp;highly liquid assets.</p>
<p>Finally, a&nbsp;<b>new generation of&nbsp;software engineers has grown up</b>, who have an&nbsp;enormous enthusiasm to&nbsp;fix mistakes of&nbsp;the&nbsp;past and&nbsp;bring cryptographic engineering to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new level: with clean designs, excellent documentation, record-breaking performance, safety and&nbsp;usability, and, most importantly, strong ethics.</p>
<p>Today we have <b>robust cryptographic building blocks</b> that are not&nbsp;only safer and&nbsp;faster, but&nbsp;also designed to&nbsp;be composable and&nbsp;extensible to&nbsp;build on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;them with confidence: such as&nbsp;<a href="http://keccak.team/">Keccak</a>, <a href="https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/wiki/AES-SIV">AES-SIV</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://ristretto.group/">Ristretto</a>.</p>
<p>We have <b>better programming languages</b> (Rust, Go, Swift) where engineering can be done with clarity, safety and&nbsp;ease. Pure Rust libraries such as&nbsp;<a href="https://miscreant.io/">Miscreant</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://dalek.rs/">Dalek</a> set a&nbsp;new bar for&nbsp;all cryptography engineers.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;first time ever, the&nbsp;<b>ambitious ideas of&nbsp;zero-knowledge proofs</b> that were stuck in&nbsp;academic papers for&nbsp;many years are finally implemented for&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain applications: <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, <a href="https://elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/">Confidential Transactions</a>, <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/">Bulletproofs</a>.</p>
<p>We are living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;renaissance era of&nbsp;cryptography: <b>we have fantastic tools, amazing people and&nbsp;strong demand for&nbsp;high-quality cryptographic products with direct financial incentives</b>. We are now at&nbsp;a&nbsp;lift-off point: we have a&nbsp;strong foundation to&nbsp;build upon with confidence. Now is the&nbsp;best time ever to&nbsp;learn and&nbsp;work with cryptography. Expect truly transformative technologies come out of&nbsp;this mix in&nbsp;the&nbsp;coming years.</p>

<p>The paper is titled “<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vldb01_pax.pdf">Weaving Relations for Cache Performance</a>”
</p>
<p>The approach achieves&nbsp;<strong>high CPU cache performance</strong> by changing the&nbsp;in-page data placement from row to columnar without a penalty.</p>
<ol>
	<li>this is datapage in the database sense, so typically about 4kb of datarows are laid out on to a “page”
	</li>
	<li>this works well, and snowflake (and the authors of that paper) want to keep that dataset on that page
	</li>
	<li>but the research proposes a new way to organize(/layout) the data on the page, such that when the CPU says “Give me next value” that next value (and the next and the next) are usually in the cpu-cache already, which prevents a slow lookup from ram/disk</li>

		<p>The paper is “<a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p539-neumann.pdf">Efficiently Compiling Efficient Query Plans for Modern Hardware</a>”
		</p><blockquote><p>As main memory grows, query performance is more and more determined by the raw CPU costs of query processing itself. The classical iterator style query processing technique is very simple and flexible, but shows poor performance on modern CPUs due to lack of locality and frequent instruction mispredictions. Several techniques like batch oriented processing or vectorized tuple processing have been proposed in the past to improve this situation, but even these techniques are frequently out-performed by hand-written execution plans.
			<br>
		In this work we present a novel compilation strategy that translates a query into compact and efficient machine code using the LLVM compiler framework. By aiming at good code and data locality and predictable branch layout the resulting code frequently rivals the performance of handwritten C++ code. We integrated these techniques into the HyPer main memory database system and show that this results in excellent query performance while requiring only modest compilation time.

		<p>You can see the “scanned partitions” versus “total partitions” in the Query Profile.</p>
		<blockquote><p>“Snowflake keeps pruning-related metadata for every individual table file. The metadata not only covers plain relational columns, but also a selection of auto-detected columns inside of semi-structured data, see Section 4.3.2. During optimization, the metadata is checked against the query predicates to reduce (“prune”) the set of input files for query execution. The optimizer performs pruning not only for simple base-value predicates, but also for more complex expressions such as WEEKDAY(orderdate) IN (6, 7).
			<br>
		Besides this static pruning, Snowflake also performs dynamic pruning during execution. For example, as part of hash join processing, Snowflake collects statistics on the distribution of join keys in the build-side records. This information is then pushed to the probe side and used to filter and possibly skip entire files on the probe side. This is in addition to other well-known techniques such as bloom joins [40].”</p></blockquote>

		<p>Using 10-20 filters(/features) and 50k-100k rows to determine the best partioning strategy, results in a 2-5x query time speedup over hash(/similar) partitioning.</p>
		<p>The feature-vectors can be re-used for pruning if a query contains one or more of the feature-filters.</p>
		<blockquote><p>“We first extract representative filters in a workload as features using frequent itemset mining.”</p></blockquote>

		<p>NT: They also group-by here, to weight the vectors and reduce the # of vectors</p>
		<blockquote><p>“We then formulate the blocking problem as a optimization problem on the feature vectors, called Balanced MaxSkip Partitioning.”</p></blockquote>
		<p>NT: Balance is key so that the partitions come out to be the same size</p>
		<blockquote><p>“To find an approximate solution efficiently, we adopt the bottom-up clustering framework.”</p></blockquote>

	<note id="note-18">For every partition, you can deem it relevant, not-relevant or ambivalent and immediately toss out the relevant</note>
	<note id="note-19">They still have to do a bunch of statistics at load time and store a bunch of meta-data, but much less work than a B-tree</note>

		<p>So you could build a list of the most common paths in a JSON object and then project those, and keep metadata statistics useful for joining, etc</p>

		<p>You can see some query profiles say “Metadata only”</p>
		<blockquote><p>To make it easy to add new metadata objects, we built an object-mapping layer on top of key-values. Schema definition, evolution and metadata versioning are done by this layer as well. User-visible objects, such as catalog definitions, users, sessions, access control, copy history and others all have metadata backing them. Every statement executed has a metadata entry, along with statistics of its execution. Transaction state and lock queues are also persisted in FoundationDB. In fact, lock queues are implemented using the watch feature mentioned earlier. A data manipulation statement is enqueued on a resource’s lock queue, and a FoundationDB watch notifies the statement when the statement reached the front of the resource’s queue. There is also user-invisible metadata such as data distribution information, servers and encryption …</p></blockquote></note></notegroup></main></div>

January 19, 2021 | https://qvault.io/2021/01/19/building-an-nlp-engine-is-hard-but-not-as-hard-as-defining-terms/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2021/01/19/building-an-nlp-engine-is-hard-but-not-as-hard-as-defining-terms/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In my full-time role at <a aria-label="Nuvi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nuvi.com/blog/strategic-decision-making-nuvis-all-new-language-engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nuvi</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where we’re able to push the boundaries in the natural language processing field. We built out several different “facets” that we score text on, including sentiment, emotion, vulgarity, tense, and currently, we’re working on promotion detection.</p>
<p>While the technical side of NLP is hard, one of the hardest things was unexpected – defining the boundaries between the categories in question. Which words count as vulgar? Does anticipation entail positive emotions? Can a single tweet exude anger and fear at the same time despite being opposites according to Plutchik? In this article, we’ll explore some of these questions and how we ended up answering them.</p>
<h2>Emotion Facets</h2>
<p>The eight emotions we set out to build a classification engine for are defined by <a aria-label="Plutchik's wheel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.6seconds.org/2020/08/11/plutchik-wheel-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plutchik’s wheel</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Joy</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Trust</li><li>Disgust</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Surprise</li></ul>
<p>Our emotion detection is based on a probabilistic algorithm that requires training and test data from human-annotations. In order to get a high-quality dataset, we found early on that simply telling our annotators to categorize sentences as to whether or not the author was expressing “anticipation” wasn’t <em>nearly</em> enough instruction. Once we got down to the brass tacks of some specific examples, we found that <em>we didn’t even agree internally</em> on classifications in many instances.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the examples we had trouble with as a team and go over the conclusions we came to. If you have thoughts be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">tweet at me</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of anticipation according to <a aria-label="Oxford (opens in a new tab)" href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oxford</a> is “The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.” In other words, we’re looking for when someone is showing forethought, making a prediction, etc. Here are some examples we agreed on quickly as expressing “anticipation”:</p>
<ul><li>“I can’t wait to go to the movie theater again!”</li><li>“I’m so excited for sports to come back, can’t happen soon enough!”</li><li>“Tesla stock is way too high, it’s going to tank soon.”</li></ul>
<p>The first one we had trouble with was:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m so nervous to go back to the office. Working from home has been great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us had the idea that “anticipation” carried a connotation of “being excited”. In other words, you can’t really anticipate something if you <em>don’t want</em> it to happen. We eventually decided that this isn’t a useful definition for several reasons. First, we already do sentiment classification separately, so baking positive sentiment into the anticipation facet isn’t super helpful. Second, the opposite of anticipation in our emotion wheel is “surprise”. We all agreed that surprises can be good or bad. It stands to reason the surpise’s opposite, anticipation, should behave the same way.</p>
<p>The next problematic example arose a few days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if I’m going to win</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates made the point that this sentence expresses apprehension, which can be considered a form of anticipation. I played devil’s advocate saying that “I don’t know” is the polar opposite of a prediction, how can that be anticipation?</p>
<p>In the end, we found that we had to provide paragraph-long explanations of each category to our annotators, complete with examples of what is and isn’t counted as a part of the category in question.</p>
<h2>Vulgarity Detection</h2>
<p>NSFW Disclaimer: <em>I’m going to talk about our vulgarity detection, and will need to say some naughty words. If you find that offensive turn back now!</em></p>
<p>The way the current iteration of our vulgarity engine works is to take a piece of text as input, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well hot damn those potatos hit the spot!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And output a fractional score from 0-1 representing how likely the text is to contain vulgar text. For the above sample, it might be something like <code>.75</code> Which brings us to our first problem, <strong>what do <em>we</em> consider to be vulgar?</strong></p>
<p>According to one of my teammates “damn”, “shit” and “hell” aren’t bad words. However, while <em>he may not</em> consider them to be, <em><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many people do</a></em>. We’re left in the interesting position of trying to rank all the vulgar words. Here are some of the biggest issues we ran into with vulgarity:</p>
<h3>Not all bad words are created equally</h3>
<p>Most people would loosely agree with the following ranking from most vulgar -&gt; to least vulgar :</p>
<ul><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<h3>Religious / Culture Specific</h3>
<p>However, problems arise when people of different religious beliefs examine the list. A Christian person may consider the following list accurate:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Jesus Christ!</li><li>Oh my God!</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>Whereas the atheist/agnostic/pagan may not consider “Jesus Christ!” or “Oh my God!” to deserve to be on the list at all.</p>
<h3>Geographically Specific</h3>
<p>If you’re from England proper, you may also expect a few additional words:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Wanker</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Bloody</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>In the end, we ended up mixing the concept of probability and intensity for the sake of simplicity and we’ve found that our clients are happy with the result. For example, the presence of an intensely “bad” word that’s recognized by basically everyone as vulgar will have a higher weight in the probability calculation than one which is weaker or not accepted by everyone as “bad”.</p>
<p><code>vulgarity_weight = intensity * acceptance</code></p>
<p>Once we started looking at everything as a fluid spectrum it became much easier to agree amongst ourselves what constitutes “vulgarity”. My coworker who claimed “shit”, “damn”, and “hell” aren’t vulgar easily admitted that they’re <em>more vulgar</em> than trivial interjections like “crap”, “dang”, or “heck”.</p>
<h2>Promotion and Solicitation Detection</h2>
<p>The project we’re working on currently has also turned out to be a vague and difficult one to pin down. The goal is to classify text as to whether it’s promotional or not, but we’ve had a hard time defining what we want. For example, we all agreed quickly that the following we classify as :promotional”:</p>
<ul><li>“We are doing a sweet promo this week! Sign up for 20% off”</li><li>“Our new product just launched, be sure to check it out”</li><li>“GORGEOUS 😍 previously owned Gucci backpack for $1700😍😍 ⭐️WE SHIP ⭐️ Call the store to purchase 555-555-5555 📲”</li></ul>
<p>The following however posed an interesting problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want a $42&nbsp;@gucci lipstick yes I do…. can I afford it right now No I cant&nbsp; but it’s soooo good!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s obviously promoting Gucci, it isn’t actually soliciting direct action from the reader. There’s no call to action. Is this a requirement of a solicitation as scored by Nuvi? We’re not sure yet – but we’re figuring that out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Date published: </p><!-- --><p>6-Jan-2021</p></div></div></div><hr><p>JavaScript</p><p>React</p><p>Gatsby</p><p>SVG</p><p>Netlify Functions</p><p>GitHub REST</p><hr><p>After a recent Twitter conversation with my good chum <a href="https://twitter.com/spences10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott</a> we decided we'd run a
little experiment that will attempt to broadly achieve the same thing but in two different ways.</p><hr><p>The "end goal" if you like, will be to request data using a GitHub API, or more specifically request data regarding the
programming languages used in <strong>all</strong> repositories for a given GitHub user and render a nice looking Doughnut Chart in a
Gatsby Blog.</p><p>Like any good scientific experiment we've broken it down into five keys areas:</p><h2>1. Observations</h2><p>As the above Tweet mentions we're aware there are two main GitHub API's available</p><ol><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL API</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST API</a></li></ol><h2>2. Question</h2><p>Again, as the above Tweet mentions we're not quite sure if both API's can deliver the same data, and we're unsure if
data should be requested at run time or build time and lastly what kind of "graphic method" should be used to surface
the data in a data visualization</p><h2>3. Hypothesis</h2><p>It's assumed that a GraphQL API will likely be more flexible in terms of what kind of data can be requested</p><p>Whereas the REST API data will be somewhat restricted by the predetermined responses from predefined end points</p><p>"fetching" this data via either API method could either be requested at build time and baked into a Gatsby page or
requested at run time using a more traditional GET request.</p><p>If the request happens at run time a Serverless Function could be used as a middle ground between the blog making the
request and the GitHub API end point, but naturally would fail if JavaScript had been disabled in the browser. However
requesting data as and when a user visits the page means it will always be in sync with the source data.</p><p>If the request happens at build time using Gatsby's
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#sourceNodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourceNodes</a> then data would be part of
the statically created pages and wouldn't be affected if JavaScript had been disabled in the browser. However, since the
data is only requested at build time there's a chance it <em>could</em> quickly get out of sync with the source data.</p><p>...and as a wild card run time approach Scott suggested using a similar Serverless Function that returns an <code>img</code> <code>src</code>
eg. <code>&lt;img src='https://some-serverless-function/some-source.jpg' /&gt;</code> which would work-round the possible JavaScript
disabled in the browser issue but would require the Chart to be rendered server side.</p><p>Displaying data as an image naturally removes any possibility for interactivity or animation and potentially raises some
accessibility concerns.</p><h2>4. Method</h2><p>To test our Hypothesis we created an
<a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umbrella Issue</a> outlining the experiment in broad
terms and below is the tech we've chosen to use 👇</p><div><div><h3>Scott</h3><ul><li>Gatsby</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Vercel Functions</li><li>GitHub GraphQL API</li><li>Puppeteer</li><li>Google Charts</li></ul></div><div><h3>Paul</h3><ul><li>Gatsby</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Netlify Functions</li><li>GitHub REST API</li><li>Svg Chart</li></ul></div></div><h2>5. Results</h2><div><div><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/www-paulie-dev/image/upload/v1609952268/paulie.dev/2021/01/gatsby-netlify-github-embedded-paul_vzpddb.jpg"></p><hr><h3>Paul</h3><p>My demo and repo are available on the below links and my results are explained further down the page 👇</p><ul><li></li><li><a href="https://gatsby-netlify-github-rest.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demo 👀</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repo 🦜</a></li></ul></div></div><p>On initial inspection there seems to be no real difference between Vercel Functions and Netlify Functions and we've
concluded that depending on whoever you use for hosting will most likely determine your choice.</p><h3>API's</h3><p>The API's on the other hand do differ somewhat. Since this was Scott's idea it's largely based around the idea of
retrieving all programming languages used for a given GitHuber user.</p><p>Using the GraphQL API you can achieve this by requesting <code>languages</code> from the <code>user</code> endpoint. In the query below Scott
has also requested the "top or first 5" results</p><p><em>For brevity i've removed some of Scott's query but you can see the full query

Compare this to the
GraphQL response where <code>languages</code> is an array</p><p>The REST response appears to only return the predominant language whereas the GraphQL response returns all languages
used per repo along with a color value which could be used as an indicator in a graph or legend.</p><p>So that's 1 - 0 to GraphQL. I did attempt to make a second request using the repository
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/repos#list-repository-languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">List repository languages</a>
endpoint for each repository returned by <code>/users/{username}/repos</code> but instantly hit the rate limit so unfortunately
deeper information about languages for users doesn't appear to be possible using the REST API.</p><h3>Charts</h3><p>Scott's approach is for the Chart to be created Server Side and returned as an image url via the Serverless Function.
You can see more of that <a href="https://github.com/spences10/github-user-information/blob/main/pie.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p><p>This is a really nice solution and will work when JavaScript is either enabled or disabled in the browser as the
endpoint is being used directly as the <code>img</code> <code>src</code></p><p>For example:</p><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>img alt</span><span>=</span><span>"some chart"</span><span> src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://github-user-information-k6t91d33k.vercel.app/card.jpg?username=spences10"</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre><p>Some drawbacks I suppose are that the image can only describe itself via an <code>alt</code> tag which perhaps might not be great
for accessibility and naturally images can't be interactive or animated.</p><p>My approach is to use both the <code>sourceNodes</code> API from <code>gatsby-node</code> at build time making the data available in Gatsby's
GraphQL layer <strong>and</strong> a ServerLess Function at run time via a typical <code>GET</code> request.</p><p>The Chart I created which i've <em>amusingly</em> named <code>&lt;MrCharty /&gt;</code> can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/blob/main/src/components/mr-charty/mr-charty.tsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and
has broadly been based on
<a href="https://medium.com/@heyoka/scratch-made-svg-donut-pie-charts-in-html5-2c587e935d72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/heyoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Caron</a></p><p>In this post I explain how I created the Chart:
<a href="https://paulie.dev/posts/2021/01/react-svg-doughnut-chart/">Create an Svg Doughnut Chart for your Gatsby blog</a></p><p>On that note, <em>my chart isn't interactive but given it's an Svg, it could be</em> ☝️</p><h4>Build Time / Server Data</h4><p>Using <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/blob/main/gatsby-node.js#L3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourceNodes</a> in
<code>gatsby-node</code> i'm using the <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/blob/main/query.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">query</a> to
hit the GitHub REST API and convert the response into GraphQL nodes which are then query-able via Gatsby's GraphQL
layer... or in simpler terms this data can then be statically <em>baked</em> into the page.</p><p>This approach means the Chart will display regardless of if JavaScript is enabled or disabled in the browser. However,
since the request to the GitHub REST API happens at build time there's a high risk this data will become out of sync
with the source data. I did investigate the option to use a webhook but as seen above this is only available at a
repository level not at a user level.</p><h4>Run Time / Client Data</h4><p>Using the same <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/blob/main/query.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">query</a> i'm able to make
a client side request to the
<a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-github-rest/blob/main/functions/get-all-user-repos/get-all-user-repos.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServerLess Function</a>
which renders the response as a Chart in the "page" component using React's <code>useEffect</code> and <code>useState</code>.</p><p>This approach means data will always be synced with the source data but will only work if JavaSCript is enabled in the
browser.</p><p>I've mentioned <em>"JavaScript is either enabled or disabled in the browser"</em> a few times throughout this post and our
reasons for wanting to experiment with alternative approaches isn't because we're necessarily concerned that users
visiting our blogs will in fact have JavaScript disabled but more because we're aware that the more client side requests
that are made from any given page can and do lead to slower page load times. Both Scott and myself are massive Gatsby
fans and always try where possible to keep out load speeds Blazing Fast.</p><p>That just about sums up the experiment, and I think the following are the key take away points to consider before
attempting to use any of the above approaches as all seem to have prose and cons</p><ol><li>Start with the API, if an API can't return the data you need, you'll probably have to modify your idea. In our
experiment I believe the GraphQL API is the one you'd want to use.</li><li>If enabled / disabled JavaScript is important consider either an image or generating GraphQL nodes at build time</li><li>Is the source data likely to change a lot? If it does, perhaps a run time request is more favorable than a build time
request. However if a webhook is available consider:
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-cloud-good-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatsby Cloud is your (Good Friend)</a></li><li>If accessibility and / or interactivity or animation are important an image probably isn't the best solution.</li></ol><p>So there you have it multiple ways to <em>kinda</em> achieve the same thing. JavaScript is hard!</p><p>See you around 🕺</p><hr><hr><hr><a href="https://ko-fi.com/P5P31B7G8" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg"></a></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h3>An Engineer’s Guide to Enterprise-grade Single Sign-on<a href="#an-engineers-guide-to-enterprise-grade-single-sign-on" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>OAuth and <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/what-is-saml">SAML</a> are both open specifications for exchanging access credentials for a specific user between an identity provider and an application. When a user wants to sign in to an app using either SAML or OAuth, they are sent to a third party where the user must already be registered. They sign in to this third party, and get sent back to the application. The mechanisms differ, but both SAML and OAuth involve using secrets to securely exchange information about the user in order for the application to begin an authenticated session for the user.</p><p>If you’re approaching these technologies as an engineer, you can consider OAuth to be <em>class based</em> while SAML is <em>instance based</em>. With OAuth, you configure your application with a provider like GitHub, and any GitHub user can now sign in to your app. But with SAML, you must configure your application with an Identity Provider (IDP) <em>instance</em>. Each customer who wants to use SAML will have an instance with their IDP, and you and the customer must perform a configuration between your app and their IDP instance. </p><p>While this might seem like a small distinction for SAML vs. OAuth, as you pull on the instance thread, you begin to understand implementing SAML to be a much bigger project than implementing OAuth - it needs CRUD and persistence, a UI to configure instances, and documentation for your customers and teammates, and you’ll need to adjust how your sign-in form works. These knock on effects are way more important to think about than the nitty gritty details of SAML — like most things in modern web dev, really strong libraries exist for the nitty gritty, but they only get you 90% of the way there when building a production-ready integration.</p><h3>An abridged and personal history of OAuth<a href="#an-abridged-and-personal-history-of-oauth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I started programming for the web right in the midst of the “social web 2.0” era and OAuth was <em>everywhere</em>. It was the heyday of hackathons, a more fun and flippant wacky Internet, where OAuth both helped you get up and running quicker, bypassing password based auth, and also gave you a wealth of users’ data to mix and match and create experiences with - Facebook friends, Foursquare checkins and Tweets…at least when the fail whale was kept at bay.</p><p>OAuth was convenient for the average web user. It wasn’t necessarily designed as a way to authenticate your users, but folks started using it that way and never really looked back. Instead of remembering passwords for hundreds of websites, the average Internet user was happy to hand over keys to their Facebook account for the convenience of signing in with Facebook. Providers, consumer engineers and users eventually got smarter with scopes, limiting what an app could do on your behalf in the account you had OAuthed.</p><p>OAuth remains a popular authentication mechanism today, for both consumer and business applications. It’s incredibly easy to implement - languages and frameworks often have standardized approaches or libraries that make this easier. In Ruby, there’s <a href="https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">omniauth</a>, “a library that standardizes multi-provider authentication for web applications”. Any developer can create an omniauth “strategy” for a specific web service. Passport is a similar approach for NodeJS apps.</p><p>You’ll typically register your application on the web service’s developer portal, where you’ll get a Client ID and Client Secret, specify redirect URIs and choose the scopes you want to use. Add these secrets to your application, drop in an OAuth library, and you’re done in less than an hour. OAuth is definitely convenient for users and engineers, but when it comes to large or security-focused enterprises, SAML is the best choice for them and their employees (even if it’s a headache to implement).</p><h3>Keeping CISOs up at night<a href="#keeping-cisos-up-at-night" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A Chief Information Security Officer is the person ultimately responsible for an organization's information and data security. A good way to shirk this responsibility would be to allow your employees to sign up for critical apps and services using a password or through OAuth against an identity provider that the enterprise doesn’t control. Consider an employee who is terminated, but signed in to all of their services using email and password or their personal Twitter account. </p><p>The IT department would need to ensure, right at the time of termination, that the employee’s access to services is cut off. They would need to go into the account settings for every service and remove that user. At enterprise scale, tens or hundreds of employees might leave in a given week. Managing account access would be a never-ending nightmare for the IT department.</p><h3>SAML locks it down<a href="#saml-locks-it-down" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once again the SAML part is not really what matters here. Many IDPs support other technologies for exchanging credentials, including OAuth. But SAML is the standard that enterprises have adopted and is supported by every enterprise-grade Identity Provider. </p><p>The important aspect of enterprise-grade Identity Providers is that they centralize user access to applications. When an employee is terminated, the IT department can go to just one place where they remove the user, and the user immediately loses access to all of the services they used at work. SAML stands for “Secure Assertion Markup Language”, but in common usage, SAML is an authentication mechanism where an enterprise can easily shut off access. When an enterprise requires that you offer SAML authentication, it’s not because they love old clunky technologies or want to annoy you — they simply need to be able to manage employee access to services in a single place.</p><h3>SAML slows you down<a href="#saml-slows-you-down" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you need to add SAML, that’s a great problem for your company to have! It means you’re moving up market and selling to bigger companies with a larger deal size and who tend to be a little stickier. If you’re thinking about adding SAML, you probably have 1,000 other things on your plate, from scaling concerns, to features you’ve wanted to add, and tech debt to address. But adding SAML might be the biggest single thing you could do to increase your company’s revenue, unlocking deals with bigger companies.</p><p>The problem is that it takes <em>a lot more work</em> to implement SAML vs. OAuth. It’s not exactly difficult work - you won’t need to write any algorithms, and lots of open source libraries exist for dealing with the actual SAML responses you receive from an IDP. But returning to our <em>class</em> vs. <em>instance</em> based distinction, lets review some tasks you’ll need to complete in order to ship a production-ready SAML integration.</p><h4>1. Configuration UI and CRUD<a href="#1-configuration-ui-and-crud" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Every SAML-needing customer will need to be onboarded, where a teammate will provide some information to your customer, like an Assertion Consumer Service URL and an Entity ID. These are part of the SAML spec, and going into detail about their functions is beyond the scope of this post, but know that your application will need to generate these values, unique to each customer. Once your customer configures your app in their IDP, they’ll return some data to you, often in the form of a metadata XML file. Will you parse this for the keys and SSO URL you need to persist? Or have your teammates open the XML and copy out the data? Either way you’ll need to persist it all in a database table, and have a reliable way to look it up when a user wants to log in.</p><h4>2. Documentation<a href="#2-documentation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>You can’t assume that your customer will know how to set up a SAML app in their IDP instance, so you’ll need to provide some instructions. That typically means signing up for all of the common IDPs, working your way through their documentation and configuring a test app, QAing with your codebase, and ultimately creating some sort of documentation to help your customers. Skip this at your peril - this will be the first thing your valuable enterprise customer experiences after signing a deal. </p><h4>3. Sign-in UX<a href="#3-sign-in-ux" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Since SAML authentication is instance based, you need to route users to the right IDP via the SSO URL your customer returned to you. Unlike OAuth, you can’t just stick a Sign in With Okta button on your login page and be done. The two common ways of approaching this are to either split your login form into two steps, first ascertaining email and sending to the IDP if the user belongs to an enterprise SAML account, or to create a second SAML SSO login form that only collects email or company domain.</p><p>That’s a lot of work! If you’re reading this, I think we can probably assume that your teammates in support don’t know what SAML is, so you’ll probably need some internal docs and training too. And we haven’t even gotten into the SAML spec itself! Attribute mapping, Single Log Out, there’s still more to think about here.</p><h3>Osso lets you treat SAML as OAuth<a href="#osso-lets-you-treat-saml-as-oauth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>You’ve probably implemented OAuth at some point in your career, you may even have it in your current stack already for things like signing in with Google. It’s simple to set up - register your client, allow-list some redirect URIs and grab a Client ID and Secret. SAML on the other hand, while conceptually similar, requires configuration per customer instance, which makes a SAML integration a bit heavier of a lift. </p><p>​<a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/1-0-0-release-candidate">Osso</a> allows you to sign SAML users in using an OAuth flow - it's SAML as OAuth instead of SAML vs. OAuth. Osso handles everything SAML - our Admin UI is easy for non-technical teammates to use in order to onboard customers and generates custom documentation for your customer’s Identity Provider. When your customer returns an XML metadata file to you, your teammates can easily upload it, where the required values get parsed out and persisted. Osso provides libraries for omniauth and Passport, making your integration even easier. You can even keep your sign in UX the same - Osso offers a hosted login page so you can just add a “Sign in with SSO” button or link (though we do recommend eventually deepening your integration by sending a user to Osso with a domain or email for IDP routing). </p></section></div>]]>

<p>In 1966, a young woman drowned in the Ropers Motel pool in Pecos, Texas and for more than 50 years her true identity was unknown. The young woman, known until recently as Pecos Jane Doe, checked into the Ropers Motel with an unknown male companion, using the names, Mr. and Mrs. Russell Battoun. Hours later, a hotel employee found the woman’s body in the hotel pool. As the woman was being taken away in an ambulance, her companion checked out of the hotel and was never seen again.</p>

<p>More than 50 years later, Pecos Police Department Chief Lisa Tarango, continued the search for Pecos Jane Doe’s true identity. The victim is buried with a gravestone marked, "Unknown Girl Drowned July 5, 1966" and agency officials have continued to visit her grave and bring flowers.&nbsp;Pecos PD worked with NamUs to collect dental and anthropological information, as well as to do the inital STR testing. </p>

<p>Othram reached out to the Pecos Police Department in early 2020 to help identify the woman using advanced DNA testing. The laboratory work was funded mostly by Pecos Police Department, with a supplementary crowdfund established through DNASolves. Skeletal remains were brought to Othram in August 2020 and work on the case began, first to develop a DNA extract from the bone, and then to construct a DNA profile using Forensic-Grade Genome Sequencing®. </p>

<p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provided support and resources to faciliate an identification. First, NCMEC had produced an artistic sketch of what the woman might have looked like. Later, after successful DNA testing, they coordinated the genealogical research, securing the services of Innovative Forensic, who generously donated the time and resources to work family trees and produce a candidate lead. Pecos Police Department confirmed the lead through DNA testing of a close relative, confirming the identity of Pecos Jane Doe as Jolaine Hemmy. </p>

<p>Jolaine was 17 years old in 1966, working at a drive-in diner in Kansas City, Kansas. She abruptly vanished one day and didn't pick up her last paycheck. Her family reported her missing and worked hard to find out where she had gone and despite tremendous efforts by family and law enforcement, they were unable to find her. At least one family member remembers a man that took particular interest in Jolaine around the time of her disappearance, but little is known about him. Pecos Police Department is continuing to investigate. If anyone has information about Jolaine Hemmy, her disappearance, or the man that she was last seen with, please contact the Pecos Police Department at 432-445-4911 attention Cpl. Felix Salcido. </p>

<p>With software engineering, speed and memory are the basic measurement-benchmarks. For programming language implementations, the two affect each other heavily. In JIT compilers, that means storing more things in memory to speed up the program drastically. It also means putting time into garbage collection to keep memory down, spending time to try to eliminate allocations and deciding where to put some piece of data. </p>
<p>Escape Analysis is a technique that determines the behaviour of how a variable (more specifically, a pointer) is used in a certain scope, and whether it not it escapes that scope (the scope is usually a function). Escape analysis allows the program to stack allocate (here is an article on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap/80113#80113">Stack vs Heap </a>allocations) when it's determined the variable will not be used outside of the scope or in other cases, try to eliminate the allocation completely. </p>

</h3>
<p>Pypy puts a lot of work into minimizing <em>boxing</em>, which is done through escape analysis. Boxing is when a primitive is boxed into an object wrapper type, such as an <code>int</code> to <code>Integer</code> in Java. Object oriented language implementations often utilize boxing (sometimes called auto-boxing), including JavaScript, C#, Haskell and others! Computers natively understands types like booleans and integers, but not objects, and unfortunately many languages need to store most of their data as an object and not the primitive. For example, <code>314</code> as a constant can be stored as a primitive on the stack, but when <code>314.toString()</code> is executed, <code>314</code> has to be boxed so that the method can be run on the object. Unboxing is performed to extract the value. </p>
<p>Boxing and unboxing is an expensive operation, with .NET citing 20x the time for boxed assignment and 4x the time for unboxing assignment (when you explicitly cast back). Pypy also has expensive boxing operations, as it's not just assigning/computing more values but organizing them into a heap structure. </p>
<p>Pypy considers this to be its second most important problem, and uses "virtual objects", also called virtualisation. It's a fancy term that means they avoid creating the entire heap structure, store the primitive value (not on the heap) and mock any object-operations that need to happen. While the virtual object is used in some applicable scope, read and writes are done to the virtual object without the expense of boxing/unboxing. Even more computation is saved as since the virtual object exists and no guards need to exist to verify information about the value in the object, whereas guards are usually in place to check the class after loading a value. </p>
<p>Pypy will virtualise onto the stack optimistically and then allocate later should it become necssary. Escape analysis is really powerful in JITs mostly because jitted langauges tend to be more dynamic, but also because they can very aggressively stack allocate.  Languages that compile once have to be completely confident that the escape analysis is valid (or also compile code in case of failure) <em>and</em> make decisions about how far it should look to determine a scope. JITs can kind of just hope it'll work and then actually do the allocation if it doesn't -- and remember what happened for next time (though that makes it sound a lot easier than it actually is). </p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):
  </span><span># Integer.random() is not an actual stdlib operation in Python, I used it to indicate a non-primitive object is created
  </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>Integer</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>+ </span><span>x
  x </span><span>+= </span><span>y </span><span>* </span><span>4 </span><span># this would also involves boxing without escape analysis, since operators are implemented as methods
</span><span>print</span><span>(x)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two cases of virtualisation here. The first is <code>y</code>, which will be virtualised as it does not escape. Thus in the second line of the loop, Pypy would no longer need a guard for the value of <code>y</code>. This saves us a lot more than just constructing and traversing the heap structure. When boxed, Pypy has to check the class types of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> due to the dynamic-ness of Python -- can these values be added? If they can, where is the method to describe how they are added (Python allows operator overloading)? It also has to recreate a boxed object to reassign to <code>y</code> and in more complex cases could leave behind additional garbage for the GC. </p>
<p><code>x</code> on the other hand, does escape, but it's still valuable to virtualise it, for that allocation is in a loop and the escape is outside the loop. When a jump instruction comes in (loop ends), it’ll come with code that actually allocates <code>x</code> for the garbage collector and future use. Another case of escape analysis can be found in methods;</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>():
  x </span><span>= </span><span>{</span><span>"A"</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>"B"</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>}
  </span><span>return </span><span>x[</span><span>"A"</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>x</code> will likely never escape and the allocation isn't even needed to execute the rest of the function. This particular case may actually be constant-folded away (the constant is replicated at usage sites), but abstractions of this pattern will use escape analysis. Escape analysis also often takes place for language-internal operations, and I'll describe how Javascript features and internals makes escape analysis very important. </p>
<h3 id="how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals">How Javascript Uses Escape Analysis in Language Internals<a href="#how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most complex question about escape analysis (other than maybe "how do I implement it") is probably "is this only beneficial to very shortlived variables, and if so how does it help much?". As mentioned in the Pypy example, it is sometimes to protect your program from allocations that are made by the language implementation rather than the programmer. Here's a quick example in Javascript (example taken from <a href="https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/preso/Escape-Analysis-in-V8.pdf">this PDF</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiWEWLwQ3oI">corresponding talk</a> that might be elementary at this point in the blog post). </p>
<pre><code><span>function </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span><span>}

</span><span>function </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>x: </span><span>i</span><span>, y: </span><span>i}</span><span>)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>One might not expect anything to allocate even without escape analysis, but when you create the object to pass into <code>bar</code> it is created and allocated by default since it now exists for <code>bar</code> and can escape <code>bar</code>. This is a good example of a full allocation elimination, the allocation isn't just moved into the stack, rarther <code>bar</code> is inlined and then the usage of any object at all can be optimized away. </p>
<h3 id="luajit-allocation-sinking">LuaJIT Allocation Sinking<a href="#luajit-allocation-sinking" aria-label="Anchor link for: luajit-allocation-sinking"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In most languages that box, essentially everything gets a box (except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> types, though <code>NaN</code> in Javascript is boxed into a <code>Number</code> so terms and conditions may apply). LuaJIT is smarter off the bat and manages to not box floats and is good at not allocating (when I say "allocate", I mean to the heap) constants. </p>
<p>LuaJIT's does something called <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"><em>Allocation Sinking</em></a>, which is based on escape analysis and the result is very powerful allocation removals, doing things that even the age-old Hotspot can't do. Pypy implemented a vast majority of the things that LuaJIT did (see this <a href="http://www1.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/vision/publdb/reports/pdf/ardo-bolz-etal-dls-12.pdf">2012 paper</a>) though I'd want to describe some of these optimizations in the context of LuaJIT rather than Pypy because LuaJIT gave me free examples. </p>
<p>When data is allocated, there's typically a "store" and then a "load" later on. Store-to-load forwarding is what it sounds like, getting the subsequent "load" function to receive data directly from the location of storing. This is used to have powerful allocation sinking, more commonly called "code motion" (or specifically, loop-invariant code motion as JITs tend to be concerned with loop optimizations). These examples do not use executable Lua code. </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z </span><span>-- i don't think this actually allocates in lua, but let’s pretend it does
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>What we want is for <code>x</code> to be declared outside of the loop, as it saves us that allocation every time we iterate. This could be done through code motion. </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z 
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example below, the allocation of <code>i</code> to <code>y</code> should be moved to be inside the conditional. Note that this optimization is not quite covered by the base strategy described for Pypy.</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  local </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
  </span><span>if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>:  </span><span>-- but does not escape this if statement
    </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span><span>-- should become
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>: 
    </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
    x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, LuaJIT defers the write and <em>forwards</em> the data to the read. As a result, the allocation and read are very much removed. The forwarding destination is the point of escape, which is where the escape analysis comes in. </p>
<p>LuaJIT has an explicit mark-and-sweep pass to do sinks. For an example that highlights the allocation sinking, LuaJIT performed on par with C++ and 700x faster than Lua. Specifically (taken from the <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization#implementation%5B">LuaJIT Blog</a>): </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>ffi </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"ffi"</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>point
point </span><span>= </span><span>ffi</span><span>.</span><span>metatype</span><span>(</span><span>"struct { double x, y; }"</span><span>, </span><span>{
  </span><span>__add </span><span>= </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)
   </span><span>return </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>y)
  </span><span>end
</span><span>}</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b </span><span>= </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>1.5</span><span>, </span><span>2.5</span><span>), </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>3.25</span><span>, </span><span>4.75</span><span>)
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>100000000 </span><span>do </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>+ </span><span>b </span><span>end
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This example does some things that are familiar from the Pypy example -- it creates temporary objects while performing the arithmetic (<code>point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)</code>). These two under-the-hood allocations are expensive, but LuaJIT …</p></section></div>

By providing a quantification of your success in your past roles, you indicate that you are capable of measurably improving a team.&nbsp; You also show that you value the specificity of concrete achievements over vague, hand-wavy bragging. Nonetheless, despite how effective they are, the sensible engineer runs into the problem of gathering numbers. At Leet, we write <a href="http://www.leetresumes.com/">great technical resumes for experienced technology professionals for free</a>, and we often get asked “How do you actually collect numbers to put on your resume?”</p><p><strong>Don’t be perfect.</strong> &nbsp;In order to be effective, the numbers you use need to be roughly right. While some interviewers will get greatly obsessed with the difference between 36 and 37 percent increases, for the purposes of interviewing, most are fine with knowing the improvement in loadtime was roughly 40%. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and don’t waste hours carrying out calculations to the 3rd decimal place.</p><p><strong>But be truthful.</strong> It’s important that you be truthful. If the actual improvement was 3%, then claiming 35% or 40% is factually (and morally) wrong to claim as your achievement.&nbsp; The relevant standard is probably, as my Harvard professor used to say, that the first numeral is correct, and the decimal point is in the right place. Stretching the truth any further risks a headache should your interviewer eventually check with a friend or colleague who used to work with you.</p><p><strong>Ask your peers and colleagues. </strong>One simple expedient is to ask your current or former peers and colleagues to remind you of the magnitude of your success.&nbsp; “Hey, how much were we able to get latency down with that project?” or “I’m updating my resume and can you remind me how much engagement increased when we launched the native mobile app?” Getting an answer from a third party makes your claim more valid.&nbsp; It’s also no longer just your opinion, but your teammate’s as well.</p><p><strong>Review your notes and emails.</strong> You might be surprised at how much data about your past performance you have sitting in your emails, your notebooks, or the notes you’ve taken on your laptop along the way. While being careful to not use confidential information, review what you’ve written to yourself and others in the past for quantified outcomes. Doing this has the added benefit of refreshing your memory about your past work, which will come in handy during interviews. </p><p><strong>Use external data sources.</strong> Your team’s or company’s performance is oftentimes measured by external companies for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; Traffic, engagement, rankings, loadtime, and hundreds of other variables are regularly measured, recorded and stored by third parties.&nbsp; Mining these data sources for numbers you can use on your resume can be very helpful.</p><p><strong>Estimate within your degree of confidence. </strong>The further you go back in your employment history, the fuzzier memories get. Not just yours, but your colleagues', bosses', and even our collective memory in the form of what’s available on the internet. By the time you’re 7+ years back in your work history, readily available numbers may simply be difficult to obtain. If you’re 80% or 90% certain that your recollection is accurate, for items this far back in your employment history, you can feel comfortable - not secure, but comfortable - in relying on your recollection of the facts. Again, this is probably best restricted to items about a decade or longer in the past, and in no case should you simply make things up.</p><p><strong>Invest in the process.</strong> While finding specific numbers for your resume is an investment of time and effort, the hours will pay off. Some of the best leverage in your career improvement plans comes from having a resume that gets you invited to better interviews, for better jobs, with better compensation, career growth, and titles. While it’s easier to rely on a quickly put-together resume that simply lists your past work titles and dates, it’s not as effective as taking the time to do it right. A better resume attracts more attention, interviews, and job offers.</p><p><strong>Leet Resumes can help.</strong> You might already know that we write <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>.&nbsp; In addition we’re making it easier to keep track of your numbers for the rest of your career. The easiest way to not have to remember, dig, inquire, or reconstruct numbers from your past is to write them down now, while the results are fresh in your mind. That’s why we’ll email you every 3-6 months to record one major accomplishment. We’ll save these for you over the years, so that they’ll be ready and waiting for you when the time comes to update your resume for the next stage in your career.</p><p>Your <a href="https://www.leetresumes.com/">free Leet Resume</a> is most powerful when it includes numbers that quantify your ability to do excellent work in your technical field. By focusing on getting numbers that are roughly right, from your past work, past colleagues, or past data, you can greatly improve your resume’s ability to attract more and better interest in your services.</p><p>

January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>
    <span>serverProperties</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>server-port</span> <span>=</span> <span>25565</span><span>;</span>
      <span>gamemode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"survival"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>motd</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NixOS Minecraft server on Tailscale!"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>max-players</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
      <span>enable-rcon</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    

    <section itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>A few days ago, I gained admin access to the <abbr title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</abbr> system of a German-based international online retailer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> operating a number of e-commerce websites. The ERP system included sensitive employee data, customer data, and over 160k invoices. They quickly addressed the issues and the overall communication went very well.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I noticed that <code>https://███████24.de/.git/config</code> returned an actual git config file, I started investigating further. The file content itself only revealed the repository URL, which wasn’t publicly accessible. But the mere fact that the file was accessible gave away that the <code>.git</code> directory was not properly secured on the web server.</p>

<p>The <code>.git</code> directory exists in every git repository and contains all its information, including branches, commit history, etc. With access to the files within this directory, all that information can be downloaded piece by piece, for example using tools like <a href="https://github.com/liamg/gitjacker">gitjacker</a>. Directory listing on the web server is not required for this to work.</p>

<p>After restoring the downloaded git repository to a somewhat usable state, I had access to most of the repositories files and history and started looking around. The first thing I noticed were temporary files and backup files that shouldn’t have existed inside the webroot anyway, but were additionally added to the repository – perhaps by an incautious <code>git add .</code></p>

<p>I moved on loooking through files and found some <code>.json</code> configuration files in the repository that contained credentials:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "...": {
    "url": "http://█████████████████████████████",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "123secret███",
    "database": "█████████████████████",
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even worse, the files being <code>.json</code> files, their content was – unlike <code>.php</code> files – publicly accessible from the web server, without even requiring any access to the git repository.</p>

<p><img src="https://jomo.tv/img/uos_erp_login.png#right" alt="ERP admin login"> The URL led to the company’s web based ERP system where I could simply log in with a web browser using the credentials from the JSON files.</p>

<p><img src="https://jomo.tv/img/uos_erp_menu.png" alt="The ERP system's menu bar" title="The ERP system's menu bar"></p>

<p>This gave me access to <em>a lot</em> of data and functionality, most of which was <abbr title="Personally identifiable information">PII</abbr> or company secrets. Some of these were:</p>

<p>Due to the large amount of customer data being at risk, I notified the retailer that same night. They replied the next day, were thankful and addressed the security issues in a quick and responsible manner, which I find quite noteworthy. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Accidentally exposed .git directories are very common, but they remain an oversight like any other. It is hard to prevent all oversights from happening. However, storing credentials in (supposedly private) source code is much more negligent and can be easily avoided. In this case, it led to a much worse outcome of a comparatively harmless issue. Website operators should be careful not to include files in the webroot that shouldn’t be publicly accessible, or ensure the web server is properly configured to deny access to them.</p>

<p>To prevent credentials in your source code, you can replace sensitive data with environment variables, or you can place configuration files outside your repository and webroot.</p>

A <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a> discussed a find of a Northern Song dynasty Chinese coin from England whose context suggested that it may have been a genuine ancient loss from the medieval period, along with a variety of textual and archaeological evidence for contact between England and East Asia in the Middle Ages. The following post returns briefly to this question, noting the recent discovery of a second Northern Song dynasty coin from England.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/HAMPC2BC79.jpg"><img data-original-height="571" data-original-width="1200" height="238" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h190/HAMPC2BC79.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A copper-alloy Chinese coin of the Northern Song emperor Zhenzong, dated 1008–16, found near Petersfield, Hampshire (image: <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">PAS</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>The coin in question was issued between<i>&nbsp;</i>1008 and 1016 during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Zhenzong">Emperor Zhenzong</a> of the Northern Song dynasty and was found at Buriton, Hampshire, around 9 miles from the coast. As was the case with the other eleventh-century Chinese coin discussed here <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">previously</a>, the coin doesn't seem to be part of a 'suspicious' grouping of finds or deposited curated collection, and the field that it was recovered from has also produced a handful of medieval- and immediately post-medieval finds. These include a coin of King John minted at London in 1205–7, a medieval cut farthing of perhaps 1180–1247, two fragments of one or more medieval or early post-medieval vessels, and two mid-sixteenth-century coins. As such, it seems credible that this coin too could have been a medieval-era loss, and in this context it is worth noting that such Northern Song coins might quite credibly have arrived at any point up to perhaps the late fourteenth century, given that they continued to circulate in significant numbers well into that era.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Looking more generally, the fact that we now have two, rather than one, eleventh-century Northern Song dynasty coins from England, both recovered from what seem to be medieval to early modern sites, adds weight to the case for considering them genuinely ancient losses. Interestingly, this find was also made only around 20 miles away from the only confirmed medieval imported Chinese pottery from England, a sherd of blue-and-white porcelain from a small cup or bowl that was found in a late fourteenth-century context at Lower Brook Street, Winchester. As to the wider context for these coins, the evidence for the presence of people who had, or who may have, travelled from East Asia in England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was surveyed in the <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a>, as was the evidence for people from Britain and Ireland in East Asia then. However, it is worth additionally drawing attention here to the 'global' distribution of medieval Chinese pottery and coins west of India, as mapped below, which demonstrates that finds of Chinese pottery and, to a lesser extent, coins outside of East Asia are by no means unknown.</p><p>With regard to the medieval Chinese pottery finds mapped below, substantial quantities have now been&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/afriques/1836">recognised</a>&nbsp;from around the Indian Ocean coast and in both the Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas into northern Egypt. Archaeological finds of Chinese porcelain&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">from Europe</a>&nbsp;are much rarer, although definite examples are known from Winchester, Lucera (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary), along with a handful of surviving intact items that are believed to have entered Europe in the medieval era. The most famous of these are the so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317076925_A_Chinese_Porcelain_Jar_Associated_with_Marco_Polo_A_Discussion_from_an_Archaeological_Perspective">'Marco Polo jar'</a>, a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai porcelain jar found in the&nbsp;Treasury of San Marco in Venice, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Collection/Resilience/Artefact/Sponge/54194ae6-5acb-43c1-b2e8-e7c13feb508c">Gaignères-Fonthill vase</a>, an early fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai&nbsp;porcelain vase that was&nbsp;<a href="https://jekely.blogspot.com/2010/12/note-on-fonthill-vase.html">almost certainly</a>&nbsp;present in Naples in the fifteenth century. In addition to these, there are a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">documentary references</a>&nbsp;to Chinese pottery from medieval Europe. So, the 1323 will of&nbsp;Queen Maria of Naples and Sicily is believed to mention Chinese pottery, as does a 1363 inventory of property belonging to the Duke of Normandy and a 1379–80 inventory of Louis I, duke of Anjou. It also appears in, for example, a document from late fourteenth-century Genoa listing merchandise including porcelain, lustre ware and glass, and a 1456 inventory of the property of&nbsp;Piero di Cosimo de' Medici of Florence. As such, it seems clear that Chinese pottery was present in the households of the wealthiest people in Europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Turning to the medieval Chinese coins mapped below, these are recorded much less frequently as archaeological finds and do not appear in documents from Europe at all, although this latter is hardly surprising. The only other certain find from Europe is a find of a tenth-century coin from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/37163357/%D0%9B_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%8A%D0%BA_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BE%D1%82_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D1%8A%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE_Early_Medieval_chinese_bronze_coin_from_Veliko_Tarnovo_district_%D1%81%D0%BF_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8_%D0%AE%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B8_2017%D0%B3_%D0%A1%D1%84_2018%D0%B3_%D0%B1%D1%80_1_2_%D1%81_41_42">Bulgaria</a>, although a scattering are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5985193/J_Cribb_and_D_Potts_Chinese_coin_finds_from_Arabia_and_the_Arabian_Gulf_in_Arabian_Archaeology_and_Epigraphy_1996_no_7_pp_108_118">recorded</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/2566792/Northern_Song_coin_finds_in_Harla_Ethiopia_point_to_newly_found_silk_routes_from_China_to_the_Horn_of_Africa">East</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5999530/Identification_of_a_Chinese_coin_found_in_Kuumbi_Cave_Zanzibar_by_prof_Felix_Chami">Africa</a>, the Persian Gulf, the coast of Arabia, India, and Sri Lanka, suggesting that it is not impossible that a handful of examples might have made their way to Red Sea or Persian Gulf ports and then into Europe.</p><p><b>The content of this post and page, including any original illustrations, is Copyright © Caitlin R.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    <p id="home-link">
      <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/blob/master/doc/xtrace.md" id="source-link">source</a> |
      <span id="all-docs"><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/">all docs</a>

      <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">oilshell.org</a>
      <span id="draft-warning"></span>

      
</p>
<p>Oil extends shell's <code>set -x</code> / <code>xtrace</code> mechanism to give you more visibility
into your program's execution.  It shows high-level program structure
("functions", <code>eval</code>) as well as runtime events (starting and stopping external
processes).</p>

<a name="background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In shell, the <code>$PS4</code> variable controls the prefix of each trace line.  The
default value is <code>'+ '</code>, which results in traces like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>sh -x -c 'echo 1; echo 2'</span>
+ echo 1
1
+ echo 2
2
</code></pre>
<a name="whats-wrong-with-set-x"></a>
<h3>What's Wrong With <code>set -x</code>?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It shows only an <code>argv</code> array for commands.  It doesn't tell you if the
command is a builtin, shell function, or external binary, which is important
for program comprehension (and performance).</li>
<li>It doesn't show you which commands are run in <strong>which processes</strong>.  Because
processes have their own state, this is also crucial for understanding a
shell program.  (Example: does <code>echo x | read</code> mutate a variable?)</li>
<li>It's <strong>missing</strong> other information, like when processes are started and
stopped, the exit status, and when commands come from <code>eval</code> or <code>source</code>.</li>
<li>Shell <strong>concurrency</strong> makes the trace incomprehensible.  For example, partial
lines can be interleaved.</li>
<li>Most implementations don't show non-printable and whitespace characters in a
coherent way.</li>
</ul>

<a name="oil-enhancements"></a>
<h2>Oil Enhancements</h2>
<p>Oil solves these problems.  Here's an example of tracing a builtin, a pipeline,
then another builtin:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>osh -O oil:basic -x -c 'set +e; ls | grep OOPS | wc -l; echo end'</span>
. builtin set '+e'
&gt; pipeline
  | part 103
    . 103 exec ls
  | part 104
    . 104 exec grep OOPS
  | command 105: wc -l
  ; process 103: status 0
  ; process 104: status 1
  ; process 105: status 0
&lt; pipeline
. builtin echo end
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Builtins are shown with the <code>builtin</code> prefix.</li>
<li>External commands are shown with the <code>command</code> prefix.</li>
<li>Bare <code>exec()</code> calls are shown with the <code>exec</code> prefix.</li>
<li>It shows <strong>synchronous</strong> shell constructs with indentation and the <code>&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;</code> characters.  This includes the entire pipeline, as well as <code>proc</code>
calls (not shown).</li>
<li>It shows process starts and ends with the <code>|</code> and <code>;</code> characters.  These are
<strong>asynchronous</strong> in general.</li>
<li>It shows the exit status of <strong>every process</strong>, which is important for
reasoning about failure.</li>
<li>It annotates trace lines with the shell PID (when it's not the root PID).</li>
<li>The <code>argv</code> arrays are quoted with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/qsn.html">QSN</a>.  This ensures
that they show special characters unambiguously, and that take exactly one
physical line.</li>
</ul>
<a name="option-names"></a>
<h3>Option Names</h3>
<p>This functionality is enabled by the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=xtrace_rich#xtrace_rich">xtrace_rich</a> option, but you
should generally use the <code>oil:basic</code> option group.  This group turns on
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=xtrace_rich#xtrace_rich">xtrace_rich</a> and turns off <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=xtrace_details#xtrace_details">xtrace_details</a>, which  is
equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set xtrace_rich</span>
<span>$</span> <span>shopt --unset xtrace_details</span>
</code></pre>
<a name="variables-for-the-trace-line"></a>
<h3>Variables for the Trace Line</h3>
<p>In Oil, the default trace line prefix is:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>PS4='${SHX_indent}${SHX_punct}${SHX_pid_str} '</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>SHX_indent</code> is affected by synchronous constructs like <code>proc</code> and <code>eval</code>, as
well as new processes.</li>
<li><code>SHX_pid_str</code> is only set for child shell processes (to avoid redundancy).
It has a space at the beginning like <code>' 123'</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>SHX_punct</code> is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> for legacy shell tracing (<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=xtrace_details#xtrace_details">xtrace_details</a>)</li>
<li><code>.</code> for <code>builtin</code> and <code>exec</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> for internal, stack-based, <strong>synchronous</strong> constructs
<ul>
<li><code>proc</code>, <code>eval</code>, and <code>source</code>, an entire pipeline, and the <code>wait</code> builtin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>|</code> and <code>;</code> for process start and wait
<ul>
<li><strong>synchronous</strong> processes: subshell aka <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=forkwait#forkwait">forkwait</a>, command sub
like <code>$(date)</code>, simple commands (<code>;</code>)</li>
<li><strong>async</strong> processes: <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/preview/doc/oil-help.html?topic=fork#fork">fork</a> (<code>&amp;</code>), pipeline parts, process subs
like <code>&lt;(sort left.txt)</code>, the process that writes a here doc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: Cross-shell tracing</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SHX_descriptor</code> is alias for <code>BASH_XTRACEFD</code> ?</li>
<li>Inherited <code>$SHX_indent</code> and <code>$SHX_pid_str</code></li>
</ul>
<a name="other-useful-variables"></a>
<h2>Other Useful Variables</h2>

	<div>
		<p>A couple years ago I wrote a piece on the WWI Armistice, titled <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/under-a-spell/">Under a Spell</a>.</p>
<p>The title came from a line in WWI journalist Philip Gibbs’ book <em>Now It Can Be Told. </em>Throughout, Gibbs quotes several people using that phrase — being under a spell — to describe how they went from normal life to the terror of the first modern war.</p>
<p>Because WWI was so different from previous wars, Gibbs’ book helped me think about the time of change we are in now. Not only the sudden change in the past weeks since the Capitol riot but also the buildup over the past few years and more. WWI itself was a break with the past and not just a larger version of earlier wars. Recent protests, riots, a pandemic, and more are different than earlier chaos.</p>
<p>We are under a spell now too.</p>
<p>But once cast, how do you break a spell?</p>
<p>A few scenes from Gibbs’ book stay with me. One takes place in a cafe in Cologne after the war’s end. English soldiers are having tea, served by a German waiter:</p>
<p><em>“I overheard a conversation between a young waiter and three of our cavalry officers. They had been in the same fight in the village of Noyelles, near Cambrai, a tiny place of ruin, where they had crouched under machine-gun fire. The waiter drew a diagram on the table-cloth. ‘I was just there.’ The three cavalry officers laughed. ‘Extraordinary! We were a few yards away.’ They chatted with the waiter as though he were an old acquaintance who had played against them in a famous football-match. They did not try to kill him with a table-knife. He did not put poison in the soup.”</em></p>
<p>Distant as that scene with its long-dead actors now seems, it is hopeful to know that it happened.</p>
<p>But where would that cafe be today? Physical cafes stopped being such places for us even before COVID shut them down. We give so much weight to user-generated content on social media and corporate-generated content on the news even though they often show our worst. Are those really our cafes? And what end is there to a war — if you can call it a war of beliefs or values or feelings — with opposing sides that happen to be in the same country, clumsily colored blue and red? And which are more isolated in the information they consume than where they live?</p>
<p>In the case of WWI, any good will on the part of the soldiers during the Armistice (a truce, but not technically “peace”) did not always transfer to the victors at home. As Gibbs also relayed:</p>
<p><em>“German music was banned in English drawing-rooms. Preachers and professors denied any quality of virtue or genius to German poets, philosophers, scientists, or scholars. A critical weighing of evidence was regarded as pro-Germanism and lack of patriotism. Truth was delivered bound to passion.”</em></p>
<p>This is the post-war scene I like least. However, the earlier hopeful exchange in the cafe was between soldiers who never wanted to be there. They both resented their politicians for sending them off. While they had killed each other, they hadn’t hated each other. But English soldiers returning home found different attitudes in their drawing-rooms, classrooms, and churches. Ironically, those with the least on the line felt the worst.</p>
<p>In our case, the US has become a country where family members repeat the wrong talking points and then start to hate each other. Where neighbors refuse to talk to each other because of front yard signs.</p>
<p>When WWI’s cannons cooled, Allied politicians heated up at Versailles in a much criticized peace treaty. The pandemic of that time, the 1918 flu, weakened some of those with milder views on how to pursue the peace, including the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/woodrow-wilson-1918-pandemic-world-war-i">US president</a>, who was too sick to continue to protest.</p>
<p>Old outcomes, whether intentional or not, can have long-term effects. People continued to fight for generations because of decisions made at Versailles. In the US, even today you may see that some still carry the flag from the losing side of a Civil War over 150 years ago.</p>
<p>A perfect conclusion to a war would leave no one ever wanting to carry an old flag and not because it was banned or because of what the neighbors would think. But I worry that many will still want to carry old flags.</p>
<p>To think about this mess we’re in, we can ask what was intentional, unintentional, and inevitable and what we could do now.</p>
<h2>Intentional, Unintentional, Inevitable</h2>
<p>Where does a mentally divided country go? When basic values shift enough so that most enemies are domestic, what then? Is there an Armistice?</p>
<p>Mobs in any of the protests or riots over the past year and more seem to be unintentional and inevitable. While large groups showing outrage might seem to emerge suddenly, they often have long windups. But large-scale top-down action seems to shock almost everyone with the potential for unintended consequences. Even many who hated Trump’s words leading up to the Capitol riot felt uncomfortable when companies such as Twitter, Facebook, Shopify, YouTube, and more deplatformed him.</p>
<p>On the intentional side, we have the desire to show outrage about whatever we are passionate about. It’s unintentional to lose control and go too far, but it always happens when a group grows. Enough people at the extremes start to dominate the group. Even “normal” people get swallowed up in the passion of the crowd. There are many examples of this over the past year. And it’s inevitable that this cycle happens eventually, given the supporting beliefs and feedback loops.</p>
<p>Tech and media <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/what-is-unity/">business models</a> that depend on engagement can also make downward spirals like the one we’re in inevitable.</p>
<p>When two sides separate and hold bad feelings against each other, there’s always a “what about.”</p>
<p>The construction is: “you may blame us for this thing, but what about that thing <em>you</em> did?” There is no end to it. People value different behavior differently. A rating of which is the better side only lasts so long until it flips. Keeping track takes brainpower better used elsewhere.</p>
<p><span>I was reminded of something else from history, a century before WWI. This account is from Victor Hugo’s </span><em>Les Miserables.</em> It’s <span>a work of fiction, but one that captures cultural change and redemption like few others.</span></p>
<p>This is from the conversation between a dying member of the National Convention (the government after the French Revolution) and a bishop. The French Revolution is more apt than the WWI comparison because rather than a foreign enemy we’re in a time when many Americans reserve their most bitter hatred for other Americans.</p>
<p>Conventionary: <em>“The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.”</em></p>
<p>Bishop: <em>“You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.”</em></p>
<p>Conventionary: <em>“Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration of humanity.”</em></p>
<p>Bishop: <em>“Yes? ’93!”</em> [1793 was worst year of the reign of terror]
</p><p>Conventionary: “<em>Ah, there you go; ’93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.”</em></p>
<h2>Onward</h2>
<p>Only about 30 years come between the Reagan administration and the Trump administration. Yet the range of political tools grew dramatically in that time. A former good will between members of Congress dissolved. Also notably, the Reagan administration was the last one where Americans had a clear, multi-generation external enemy.</p>
<p>Politics became a sports season that never ends. We spend lots of effort talking and thinking about our feelings of injustice coming from the other side, whatever that side is. Not as much effort building things together.</p>
<p>Now, after a contested election, four years of ill will, another contested election, and on the eve of an inauguration where could we go? Should we let another cloud form and burst again?</p>
<p>Rather than waiting for the next storm, where could we focus on outcomes over intentions? What could we build? Of course unintended consequences can come from this work too, but I believe building something together is better than pulling ourselves apart.</p>
<p>Here is just a short list. I know you could add to it.</p>
<p><em><span>Education that enlightens students and doesn’t leave them with debt. </span><span>Preventative healthcare that delivers better outcomes than better-compensated late-term procedures. Production of food that keeps people healthy. Affordable, vibrant neighborhoods rather than dull commuter towns. Protection of environmental resources. Creation of new businesses that serve a changing demographic. A better transportation system. Accurate, unbiased information in news and online….</span></em></p>
<p>Building the next society is difficult, but possibly more productive than arguing about the past one. Otherwise, what can we say about potential second-order effects of this time of ours?</p>
<p>Gibbs also wrote: <em>“Or is war the law of human life? Is there something more powerful than kaisers and castes which drives masses of men against other masses in death-struggles which they do not understand?”</em> He had no idea how his profession would change.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most common questions about <a href="https://www.prelude.org/platform/operator">Operator</a> I receive is:</p><blockquote><p>How do I access Windows APIs in C# (or C++) instead of using shell commands?</p></blockquote><p>Red and Purple teamers need to be able to craft more complicated TTPs and continually modify tradecraft to avoid detection by the blue team. Blue teamers need an easy way to validate detections given a plethora of attack vectors. Inside Operator, we provide a slew of ways to address both sides of that problem set.</p><h2>Interfacing with the target Operating System</h2><p>There are many reasons to access Windows APIs, whether it be for defense evasion purposes or validating detections and EDR hooks on those APIs. Operator offers several ways that you can interface with them:</p><ol><li><p>Using existing <a href="https://feed.prelude.org/p/meet-pneuma">Pneuma</a> executors</p></li><li><p>Using Payloads attached to commands</p></li><li><p>Using plugins for PneumaEX</p></li><li><p>Adding built-in functionality to Pneuma or PneumaEX</p></li><li><p>Writing your own agent</p></li></ol><p>I’m focusing Windows operating systems for this article, but the same principles apply to *nix platforms.  We will dive into each of these areas then finish up with a quick discussion on some of the current limitations and my plans to address them.</p><h3>1. Using existing Pneuma executors</h3><p>This is by far the most straight-forward way to interact with the Windows API, albeit through a method that most people consider not OPSEC safe. The default Pneuma agent is able to execute Powershell commands/scripts, command shell, and python scripts. An example of calling Win32 APIs via Pinvoke can be found in this community TTP that I put together using examples from&nbsp;<a href="http://pinvoke.net/">pinvoke.net</a>. This TTP will prompt a user to enter their credentials then we can dump the results in plaintext to the console:</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;innerHTML&quot;:&quot;<div id=\&quot;gist107461655\&quot; class=\&quot;gist\&quot;>\n    <div class=\&quot;gist-file\&quot;>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-data\&quot;>\n        <div class=\&quot;js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\&quot;>\n  <div id=\&quot;file-invoke-promptforcredentials-ps1\&quot;

Using Payloads attached to commands</h3><p>As previously mentioned, using PowerShell to dynamically load in Win32 libraries via <strong><code>Add-Type</code></strong>&nbsp;isn't exactly an OPSEC safe way to operate. PowerShell has its place during operations, but most blue teams will immediately notice strange PowerShell scripts being executed, particularly larger ones like the above. Red Team tradecraft has largely moved away from PowerShell for that reason.</p><p>A non-PowerShell method in Operator we can use to hit Win32 APIs is via TTP payloads. Let's take a look at this&nbsp;<strong><code>Netsh helper dll persistence</code></strong>&nbsp;TTP in our <a href="https://www.prelude.org/platform/professional">Professional License</a> repo. This TTP attaches a helper DLL to NetSh that will make&nbsp;<strong><code>system()</code></strong>&nbsp;call for whatever value is stored in the <strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Prelude\Operator</strong> key with the name&nbsp;<strong><code>bin_path</code></strong>&nbsp;(so bin_path with a string&nbsp;<strong><code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe</code></strong>&nbsp;for example). The DLL itself uses the <a href="https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers">SysWhispers project</a> to make a direct Syscall to NtCreateThreadEx in order to evade/bypass user-mode API hooks used by EDR products on calls like <strong>CreateRemoteThreadEx</strong>. The persistence triggers any time NetSh is run:</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;innerHTML&quot;:&quot;<div id=\&quot;gist107461839\&quot; class=\&quot;gist\&quot;>\n    <div class=\&quot;gist-file\&quot;>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-data\&quot;>\n        <div class=\&quot;js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\&quot;>\n  <div id=\&quot;file-whispernetshhelperpersist-cpp\&quot;

</div><p>Notice we have two different executors specified:&nbsp;<strong><code>exec</code></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><code>cmd</code></strong>.&nbsp;<strong><code>cmd</code></strong>&nbsp;will actually invoke the Windows Command Prompt and execute the command through that shell.&nbsp;<strong><code>exec</code></strong>&nbsp;is specific to PneumaEX and it does not invoke the system shell and instead makes a call more similar to a C-language "exec" call on<strong><code>&nbsp;netsh.exe&nbsp;</code></strong>after resolving it's full path. PneumaEX will automatically retrieve the payload (the&nbsp;<strong><code>#{operator.payloads}</code></strong>&nbsp;is a variable that gets "rendered" at runtime automatically specifying where your payloads are staged) and then adds the payload as a helper DLL to netsh. The&nbsp;<strong><code>#{agent.location}</code></strong> variable is the path to the current agent (if it's running on disk) so we can use the<strong><code>&nbsp;..\&nbsp;</code></strong>to resolve our current directory to have the absolute path to the payload.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Using plugins for PneumaEX</h3><p>Now you're probably thinking "okay, but you're STILL using shell and leaving command artifacts" - this is true, but that is the reason for more advanced implants/agents in the operator ecosystem. I did a fairly extensive write-up of PneumaEX's modular plugin system <a href="https://feed.prelude.org/p/keywords-to-the-kingdom-simple-modular">here</a> and have since added GRPC support for modules and started prototyping in-memory only module handling. Since the plugin system is designed using RPC/GRPC, we have the option of writing plugins in any language - from Golang to Python to C#.</p><p>PneumaEX comes with several modules written in Golang that call Win32 APIs to accomplish things like background keylogging, dumping LSASS memory, and capturing clipboard contents for exfiltration. It's fairly straightforward to load in DLLs and access their exported functions for use:</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;innerHTML&quot;:&quot;<div id=\&quot;gist107461950\&quot; class=\&quot;gist\&quot;>\n    <div class=\&quot;gist-file\&quot;>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-data\&quot;>\n        <div class=\&quot;js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\&quot;>\n  <div id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go\&quot; class=\&quot;file my-2\&quot;>\n    \n\n  <div itemprop=\&quot;text\&quot; class=\&quot;Box-body p-0 blob-wrapper data type-go  \&quot;>\n      \n<table class=\&quot;highlight tab-size js-file-line-container\&quot; data-tab-size=\&quot;8\&quot; data-paste-markdown-skip>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L1\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;1\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC1\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;><span class=pl-k>var</span> (</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L2\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;2\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC2\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>\t<span class=pl-s1>user32</span>            <span class=pl-c1>=</span> <span class=pl-s1>syscall</span>.<span class=pl-en>NewLazyDLL</span>(<span class=pl-s>&amp;quot;user32.dll&amp;quot;</span>)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L3\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;3\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC3\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>\t<span class=pl-s1>getAsyncKeyState</span>  <span class=pl-c1>=</span> <span class=pl-s1>user32</span>.<span class=pl-en>NewProc</span>(<span class=pl-s>&amp;quot;GetAsyncKeyState&amp;quot;</span>)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L4\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;4\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC4\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>\t<span class=pl-s1>getKeyboardLayout</span> <span class=pl-c1>=</span> <span class=pl-s1>user32</span>.<span class=pl-en>NewProc</span>(<span class=pl-s>&amp;quot;GetKeyboardLayout&amp;quot;</span>)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L5\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;5\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC5\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>\t<span class=pl-s1>getKeyState</span>       <span class=pl-c1>=</span> <span class=pl-s1>user32</span>.<span class=pl-en>NewProc</span>(<span class=pl-s>&amp;quot;GetKeyState&amp;quot;</span>)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L6\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;6\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC6\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>\t<span class=pl-s1>toUnicodeEx</span>       <span class=pl-c1>=</span> <span class=pl-s1>user32</span>.<span class=pl-en>NewProc</span>(<span class=pl-s>&amp;quot;ToUnicodeEx&amp;quot;</span>)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-L7\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;7\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-loadingwindll-go-LC7\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>)</td>\n      </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-meta\&quot;>\n        <a href=\&quot;https://gist.github.com/khyberspache/48a7c3c166c086f6a2c378e1f21e6eb3/raw/d3985c701fbc3411154bba80743b5a541b1a5792/loadingWinDLL.go\&quot; style=\&quot;float:right\&quot;>view raw</a>\n        <a href=\&quot;https://gist.github.com/khyberspache/48a7c3c166c086f6a2c378e1f21e6eb3#file-loadingwindll-go\&quot;>loadingWinDLL.go</a>\n        hosted with &amp;#10084; by <a href=\&quot;https://github.com\&quot;>GitHub</a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n&quot;,&quot;stylesheet&quot;:&quot;https://github.githubassets.com/assets/gist-embed-59197513360d4304fd18e1959ef4a6bd.css&quot;}"><div id="gist107461950">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I donâ€™t want to write much more than the title already expresses. But considering the constantly shifting goalposts when it comes to progress towards AGI, I think this bears writing down. </p><p>In the abstract of the seminal paper <a href="http://cogprints.org/3106/">[1]</a> on the topic, the symbol grounding problem is defined as follows: </p><blockquote><p>â€žHow can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols?â€œ</p></blockquote><p>Good questions. And also valid objections against assigning intelligence or understanding to GPT-3. And a solution is sketched: </p><blockquote><p>â€žSymbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., An X is a Y that is Z).â€œ</p></blockquote><p>(1) The â€žiconic representationsâ€œ are pictures in the case of DALL-E, certainly â€žanalogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and eventsâ€œ.</p><p>(2) â€žCategorical representations are the text token embeddings that constitute DALL-Eâ€™s input layer and the â€žinnate feature-detectorsâ€œ are provided by the VQ-VAE that decomposes images into image tokens.</p><div><p>(3) According to Harnad higher order symbolic representation can now be grounded in these grounded symbols. I.e. a DALL-E scaled to the text context size of GPT-3 trained on GPT-3 training data in addition to text-image pairs.</p></div><p>[1] Harnad, Stevan (1990) <i>The Symbol Grounding Problem.</i> </p><p><a href="http://cogprints.org/3106/">http://â€‹â€‹cogprints.org/â€‹â€‹3106/â€‹â€‹</a></p></div></div>]]>

     ● 10 Jan 2021
  </p>
  
  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Comirnaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore.</p>

<p>To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. There is only one vendor for this analogue; <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a> and its partner <a href="https://www.tebu-bio.com/">tebu-bio</a> for the European market. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these COVID vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. In their July 2020 investor update BioNTech refers to usings TriLinks trinucleotide cap and hence this is likely part of the production method of the approved vaccine.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ultimately, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and present bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> and it is the most abundant lipid in the mix<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div size="3">
I first encountered the Foonly F1 when I went to work for Omnibus Computer Graphics in 1984.
Omnibus had just purchased the system from Triple-I (Information International Inc.) in
Culver City, CA.  Omnibus had big plans to make movies with computers, and the F1 had
been used in making TRON and numerous other high resolution film projects.  Omnibus was
a Canadian company, based in Toronto, and had recently done gone public.  They had big
plans to open offices in Hollywood and New York City and be the first big digital animation
company in the film business.  Omnibus president, John Pennie saw the F1 as a machine 
with a proven track record.  When I first had a look at it, I saw it as a disaster!  It was a fascinating R&amp;D project, but was never really designed to have the support, spares, and expertise needed to keep it up and running in a serious production environment.
<p>
The F1 was originally built by Triple-I in hopes of getting a large contract
with the Government for an Optical Character Recognition system.
Its design was done by some graduate students (Stanford?) named Poole, Pettit, Holloway, and Dyer (?).
As I understand it, their design became the DEC KL-10, but I could have that wrong.
The CPU was built on five wire-wrap pages, that were machine wrapped.
</p><p>
The design was done using one of the first CAD systems I had seen, (SUDS?) which I believe ran
on a PDP-15 clone that Triple-I used in its PFR-80, which was originally intended to be a film recorder.
The PFR had a vector-tube graphics display, and the user could graphically connect various
logic elements from libraries and have wire-wrap lists generated for machine wrapping.
The PFR, incidentally, was the reason the F1 became a film-maker. 
Triple-I had figured out how to get a smaller, better controlled spot out of a CRT than
anybody else at the time, and used that technology to print film for newspaper pages.
</p><p>
<i>Author's Note: I have several of the high-rez CRTs used in the III film printers, if anybody is interested in them, please contact me, (dave (at) zfx.com).</i>
</p><p>
The F1 had a bizzarre bus interface to the PFR that allowed it to dump high resolution
imagery to the PFR and have it print to a standard 35mm camera.  The images were
send in Red, Blue, and Green records and exposed through Wratten filters onto Kodak 5247 color negative film.
Another PFR note, someone at Triple-I had programmed a simple graphics game to run on
the PDP-15 and the vector tube.  You used front-panel dials and buttons to control
acceleration and rotation vectors for spaceships that could shoot particles at each
other.  I'm not sure of the exact origin of this program, but I believe it was
the first interactive vector graphics game, which ultimately gave rise to a group of
vector-displayed videogames in the mid-eighties.
</p><p>
The F1 had enough in common with "standard" DEC-10 peripherals that it could use
a disk channel controller( RH-10?).  This was attached to  three RP-04 (~50MB) disk drives,
one for the system, and two striped together to hold a total of two high-res images.
One would be computed and saved as separate RGB files, while the previous one was
being printed on the PFR.  The F1 had a huge Ampex core memory unit that I believe
held 256K 36-bit words.  That turned out to be barely enough to do high-resolution
computer graphics, so Triple-I had built the MMM, Movie Machine Memory, which
was built out of 4K static RAM chips.  The memory was organized so that it could
be displayed as an RGB image at 1024 x 1024 on a raster high-resolution monitor.
In that mode, the MMM held 6 bits per color, 18-bits per pixel.  It could also
be used as a bulk 512K word memory for the TRANEW graphics rendering program, which 
used it to store hash tables.  It was fascinating to "watch" the program execute
on the MMM monitor.
</p><p>
<i>I actually have one of the MMM memory boards.... somewhere in my junk pile.</i>
</p><p>
The F1 required a DEC KA-10 as a "console processor".
Since it was a development machine, the console was used to load and run the
microcode.  It was also an important debugging tool when (not if!) the system
did something screwy.  There was a modem attached to the KA-10, and in an
emergency, Dave Poole could usually be persuaded to dial into it and run diagnostics.
Of course, the console machine had its own disk controllers, disks, tape drives,
even a line printer, and it ended up holding user accounts and acting as general
non-job user disk storage.  The KA-10 itself booted from punched paper tape, so
a cold-start for the entire system was quite a journey up from ground zero!
</p><p>
When the F1 was up, it probably ran at something like 6 MIPS.  That seems really
slow by today's standard, but the code had been highly optimized.  The original
Fortran program, TRANEW had been written by Gary Demos  with help from Jim Blinn,
the JPL guy that did the pioneering computer-generated fly-by animations for NASA.
They had optimized inner loops in assembly code, and had removed every last bit
of "extraneous" code from the operating system, TOPS-10.  It was really more like
Swiss Cheese than an OS.
</p><p>
A second PFR unit acted as an "encoding station", and was attached to a huge Calcomp
digitizing tablet.  External vector displays had been added, as had another puck,
so that the operator could digitize from engineering-type drawings to build a
3D database for the objects used in the animations.  There were some fairly
sophisticated programs for extruding solids, sweeping shapes through 3D paths,
and other wonders, all executing on a PDP-15!
</p><p>
So when I arrived and saw this system in operation, my initial awe for the amount
of pioneering work that had gone into making the system do all the things it had
done quickly turned into a sense of dread given the tasks I had before me, which
were to: (1) re-assemble enough of the original team-members that had used the
system to be able to do feature film production, (2) learn how the system functioned
so that it could be maintained and kept working on a grueling production schedule,
(3) attempt to find areas where its performance or reliability could be improved,
(4) MOVE the system to new facilities that were being built at Paramount Studios,
and (5) stay sane!
</p><p>
Jim Rapley, who was one of the maintenance guys who knew the Foonly, and had
worked with many of the people as it was developed at Triple-I came onboard first,
followed soon by Art Durinski, a designer who had worked on TRON, Adam the Juggler, and
many other Foonly projects.  Rich Schroeppel, a consultant for Triple-I had done
the TOPS-10 hacks and occasionally consulted, as did Jim Dungan, who knew TRANEW
and a lot of the code that ran in the PFR.
</p><p>
Of course, Gary Demos and John Whitney, having gotten Triple-I started in the movie
business, saw all the shortcomings of the Foonly.  They had pushed for Triple-I
to build the DFP, the first (that I know of) high-resolution digital film printer
for motion pictures.  This was the next generation PFR, using an 8" CRT which had
fast-decaying phosphors so that it could be used for scanning in film (using photomultiplier
tubes built into a special camera) as well as printing.  The imagery was amazing.
When they left Triple-I, they put together a deal where they got Control Data Corp.
to buy a Cray supercomputer, rent the DFP from Triple-I, attache Ramtek displays
and IMI and Evans &amp; Sutherland vector tubes for encoding and motion.  That was
Digital Productions, which Omnibus eventually bought from CDC, but I'm getting
ahead of myself.  
</p><p>
The point is that Triple-I just wanted to unload the Foonly and all its peripherals
and software as one big package, and Omnibus and John Pennie were the perfect sucker.
So Jim Rapley knew a guy named Serge Polevitzki, who was at the Naval Ocean (?NOSC) down
in San Diego.  NOSC apparently had a bunch of stuff that needed to run on a TOPS-10
system and since DEC no longer made them, Dave Poole and Foonly, Inc. obliged them
by coming up with the F4, a single rack-unit 36-bit computer that ran TOPS-10.
I flew up to Berkeley to see Poole and discuss upgrades to the F1.
</p><p>
Poole was a character.  He had long hair and a long beard and glasses.  I met him
at Foonly, Inc. which was a small warehouse that had been the assembly line for
some thirty F4's.  He wore ragged clothing and bluejeans, and had a pet parrot
that rode on his shoulder most of the time.  When the parrot wasn't on his
shoulder, it was perched in one of the "unfinished" F4's.  There was a precision
shaped piece of cardboard duct-taped into this particular machine in such a
way that the bird's droppings were deflected away from the internals of the
machine.  Poole's recommendation was that we have him build us an SMD disk
controller so that we could use bigger, faster disks, like the Fujitsu Eagles
that were popular SMD drives at the time.  Unfortunately, his schedule to do this
was going to take months, and our production schedule was already overfull.
He did what he could on the microcode side, but the upgrade never happened.
</p><p>
Probably the worst moment of my life with the Foonly came after we had managed
to get it moved to Paramount Studios and were cranking through the film for
a long sequence for Flight of the Navigator, a Disney film.  In those days,
the idea that you could have a camera make a seemingly infinite move, untethered,
fascinated film directors, so they all wanted long camera moves over an infinte
plane, probably the hardest thing for rendering algorithms to manage, what with all that 
depth sorting.  Since the Foonly only had enough disk storage to hold the frame
being computed and the frame being printed, the numbers worked out like this:
30 seconds of film at 24 frames per second works out to 720 images each computed
and printed at 6000 x 4000 pixels.  At twenty minutes rendering time each frame,
that meant it took ten days to do "the run".  As we were five days into our
final "run" for Navigator, unknown to us, a Paramount electrician was outside
hot-wiring …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="creators-of-the-hippocratic-license-establish-a-nonprofit-to-empower-developers-to-use-their-technology-talents-for-social-good-and-to-prevent-harm">Creators of the Hippocratic License establish a nonprofit to empower developers to use their technology talents for social good and to prevent harm</h3>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, January 19, 2021 – The creator of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License</a>, an ethical license for open source, and <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for open source projects, today announced the establishment of a new nonprofit, the Organization for Ethical Source (OES).</p>

<p>Central to the philosophy of open source is the notion of software freedom, referred to as “Freedom Zero”: that open source software can be used for any purpose without restriction, <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">even for explicitly “evil” purposes</a>. The world has changed since the Open Source Definition was created — open source has become ubiquitous, and is now being leveraged by bad actors for mass surveillance, racist policing, and other human rights abuses all over the world. The OES believes that the open source community must evolve to address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.</p>

<p>Inspired by the work of Latinx and Chicanx activist organization <a href="https://twitter.com/conmijente">Mijente</a> and their #NoTechForICE campaign, the Ethical Source Movement <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/ethical-source-six-month-retrospective/">launched in October 2019</a>. Its first milestone was the March 2020 release of the Hippocratic License 2.1, an ethical open source license tied to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and developed in collaboration with a pro-bono legal team from partner organization <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>. The license has already been adopted by hundreds of open source projects including the Ruby library <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr/">VCR</a>, mobile app development tool <a href="https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon">Gryphon</a>, Javascript mapping library <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">react-leaflet</a>, and the entire open source portfolio of the <a href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/story/ethical-source-at-wetransfer">WeTransfer</a> corporation. But the most significant impact of the license may be the <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">debate it sparked</a> between ethical-minded developers and open source traditionalists around the primacy of “Freedom Zero.”</p>

<p>“For too long we’ve been comforting ourselves with the myth that technology is inherently neutral. But there is nothing neutral about police using facial recognition algorithms to target legitimate protestors, or algorithms that perpetuate bias and sexism and racism, or any other of the dozens of kinds of human rights abuses we see technology playing a part in today,” said Coraline Ada Ehmke, president and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source. “As technologists we have to accept that our work has an outsized impact on society, and that means we have an outsized responsibility to minimize the harm it can cause. The Organization for Ethical Source was founded to help technologists accept these responsibilities, and learn how to center justice and equity in the work we do. We are united in our conviction that software freedom must not come before human freedom.”</p>

<p>With a founding grant from the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, the Organization for Ethical Source is developing new programs that build on its initial work with the Hippocratic License — extending the reach of that effort while developing new tools and projects focusing on ethical governance, digital supply chain compliance, and other strategies. The organization’s leadership team includes founding members Coraline Ada Ehmke, Don Goodman-Wilson, and Tobie Langel. Elections for the Governing Committee are slated to take place in February 2021.</p>

<p>“There are so many ways that communities can come together today to tackle the tech industry’s biggest problems, and that is especially true about the open source community,” said Aniyia L. Williams, Principal, Responsible Technology, Omidyar Network. “We are excited to see the formation of the Organization for Ethical Source, and are thrilled to power the innovative, thoughtful, and courageous plans they have for creating accountability in building software.”</p>

<p>“Systemic change in the tech industry is long overdue, and the Organization for Ethical Source is a much-needed catalyst,” said Charity Ryerson, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability Lab. CAL is a nonprofit organization providing legal support to the new organization through developing ethical license offerings and providing free direct legal services to ethical license adopters. “We are excited to support this initiative, and hope to see tangible improvements for cobalt miners, Foxconn workers, immigrant detainees and others who have been harmed by Big Tech.”</p>

<p>The Organization for Ethical Source brings together open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, human rights workers, academics, and more to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into open source work. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Learn more about the Organization for Ethical Source</a>, or <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-organization-for-ethical-source">About the Organization for Ethical Source</h3>

<p>The movement to promote ethics and social responsibility in open source was founded in October 2019 by Coraline Ada Ehmke, and led to the establishment of the nonprofit Organization for Ethical Source under Swiss law in December 2020. The organization is dedicated to giving technologists tools and resources to ensure that their work is being used for social good and to minimize harm. It develops tools to promote fair, ethical, and pro-social outcomes for those who contribute to, or are affected by, open source technologies. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">https://ethicalsource.dev/</a></p>

<p>Typical DBMSes suffer from a data type impedance mismatch with Haskell data types. Using such DBMSes in Haskell is especially painful because Haskell has a very powerful typing system which the database promptly discards or “downsamples” due to lack of real type support.</p>
<p>Project:M36 is a DBMS which offers support for algebraic data types (ADTs) as first-class database-side values and support for record types to be marshaled from-and-to database tuples without any loss of type enforcement. Furthermore, database-side ADTs can be manipulated with database-side stored functions written in Haskell. Types can further be preserved with constraints which can also be written in Haskell.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the common <a href="https://github.com/agentm/project-m36/blob/master/examples/blog.hs">blog post schema example</a> for an example of how these features all fit together.</p>

<p>Let’s start out by defining our model.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Blog</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span> {
<span>  title ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  entry ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  stamp ::</span> <span>UTCTime</span>,
<span>  category ::</span> <span>Category</span> <span>--note that this type is an algebraic data type</span>
  }
          <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>, <span>Show</span>) <span>--derive Generic so that Tupleable can use default instances</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Tupleable</span> <span>Blog</span>

<span>data</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>=</span> <span>Comment</span> {
<span>  blogTitle ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  commentTime ::</span> <span>UTCTime</span>,
<span>  contents ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>
  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>, <span>Show</span>)

<span>instance</span> <span>Tupleable</span> <span>Comment</span>             

<span>data</span> <span>Category</span> <span>=</span> <span>Food</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cats</span> <span>|</span> <span>Photos</span> <span>|</span> <span>Other</span> <span>T.Text</span>
  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Atomable</span>, <span>Eq</span>, <span>Show</span>, <span>NFData</span>, <span>Binary</span>, <span>Generic</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the only database-specific requirements are that the record-based models are instances of <code>Tupleable</code>, a type which can be derived from <code>Generic</code> types to marshal the Haskell values to-and-from database values. No database-specific type decorations (such as specifying SQL types) is needed. The database types are Haskell types with no type-level enforcement lost. Each record becomes a tuple in the database with the Haskell attributes directly mapped to tuple attributes.</p>
<p>The blog’s <code>Category</code> is an ADT which can be represented as a database value or <code>Atom</code>. Because the <code>Category</code> derives <code>Generic</code>, we can also derive <code>Atomable</code>. <code>Category</code> values are stored as ADTs in the database- no trickery is involved.</p>
<p>Note that an SQL enumeration would not be able to emulate an ADT directly as a database value. In Project:M36, the ADT is also represented in the database as a value of the same type. The type impedance mismatch is resolved and no database-specific changes to the model are necessary.</p>
<p>Next, let’s create our database and add some data.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()                       
main <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>--connect to the database</span>
  <span>let</span> connInfo <span>=</span> <span>InProcessConnectionInfo</span> <span>NoPersistence</span> emptyNotificationCallback []
  conn <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOError <span>$</span> connectProjectM36 connInfo

  sessionId <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOError <span>$</span> createSessionAtHead conn <span>"master"</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>createSchema ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()  
createSchema sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  _ <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOErrors <span>$</span> mapM (executeDatabaseContextExpr sessionId conn) [
    toAddTypeExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Category</span>),
    toDefineExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Blog</span>) <span>"blog"</span>,
    toDefineExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Comment</span>) <span>"comment"</span>,
    databaseContextExprForForeignKey <span>"blog_comment"</span> (<span>"comment"</span>, [<span>"blogTitle"</span>]) (<span>"blog"</span>, [<span>"title"</span>]),
    databaseContextExprForUniqueKey <span>"blog"</span> [<span>"title"</span>]
    ]
  pure ()</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we create an in-memory database (just for testing purposes) and use the <code>Tupleable</code> function <code>toDefineExpr</code> and <code>Atomable</code> function <code>toAddTypeExpr</code> to create expressions which we will execute against our database. A foreign key constraint between blogs and comments ensures that each blog can have zero or more comments. Finally, we add a uniqueness constraint on the blogs’ titles.</p>
<p>Naturally, if we wanted to store the database on disk or connect to a Project:M36 database server, we could configure that here.</p>

<p>We will use <code>scotty</code>, a lightweight web framework to present a user interface to display a list of blog posts and individual blog posts along with their blog-specific comments.</p>
<div><pre><code>scotty <span>3000</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  S.get <span>"/"</span> (listBlogs sessionId conn)
  S.get <span>"/blog/:blogid"</span> (showBlogEntry sessionId conn)
  S.post <span>"/comment"</span> (addComment sessionId conn)</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we set up our action handlers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>listBlogs ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()
listBlogs sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  eRel <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO <span>$</span> executeRelationalExpr sessionId conn (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"blog"</span> ())
  <span>case</span> eRel <span>of</span>
    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> render500 (toHtml (show err))
    <span>Right</span> blogRel <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
      blogs <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO (toList blogRel) <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> mapM (handleWebError <span>.</span> fromTuple)<span> ::</span> <span>ActionM</span> [<span>Blog</span>]
      <span>let</span> sortedBlogs <span>=</span> sortBy (\b1 b2 <span>-&gt;</span> stamp b1 <span>`compare`</span> stamp b2) blogs
      html <span>.</span> renderHtml <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
        h1 <span>"Blog Posts"</span>
        forM_ sortedBlogs <span>$</span> \blog <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>!</span> href (toValue <span>$</span> <span>"/blog/"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> title blog) <span>$</span> h2 (toHtml (title blog))</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we list all blog entries by querying the database for the relation variable “blog”. Then, we convert from database tuples to our <code>Blog</code> values using <code>Tupleable</code>’s <code>fromTuple</code> function. Then, we sort them by date and insert them into our <code>blaze-html</code> template.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>showBlogEntry ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()
showBlogEntry sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  blogid <span>&lt;-</span> param <span>"blogid"</span>
  <span>--query the database to return the blog entry with a relation-valued attribute of the associated comments</span>
  <span>let</span> blogRestrictionExpr <span>=</span> <span>AttributeEqualityPredicate</span> <span>"title"</span> (<span>NakedAtomExpr</span> (<span>TextAtom</span> blogid))
      extendExpr <span>=</span> <span>AttributeExtendTupleExpr</span> <span>"comments"</span> (<span>RelationAtomExpr</span> commentsRestriction)
      commentsRestriction <span>=</span> <span>Restrict</span>
                           (<span>AttributeEqualityPredicate</span> <span>"blogTitle"</span> (<span>AttributeAtomExpr</span> <span>"title"</span>))
                           (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"comment"</span> ())
  eRel <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO <span>$</span> executeRelationalExpr sessionId conn (<span>Extend</span> extendExpr
                                                         (<span>Restrict</span>
                                                          blogRestrictionExpr
                                                          (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"blog"</span> ())))</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we create a query that might look a little unusual by SQL standards. This is because SQL does not support relation-valued attributes whereas Project:M36 does. In this case, alongside collecting the blog information, we collect all the comments alongside the blog tuple as a nested relation containing a set of all comments for this blog post. With SQL, we would need one query per model or duplicate data with a join whereas we can consolidate our queries into one with Project:M36.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>let</span> render <span>=</span> html <span>.</span> renderHtml
    formatStamp <span>=</span> formatTime defaultTimeLocale (iso8601DateFormat (<span>Just</span> <span>"%H:%M:%S"</span>))
<span>case</span> eRel <span>of</span>
  <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> render500 (toHtml (show err))
  <span>--handle successful query execution</span>
  <span>Right</span> rel <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> singletonTuple rel <span>of</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span> <span>--no results for this blog id</span>
      render (h1 <span>"No such blog post"</span>)
      status status404
    <span>Just</span> blogTuple <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> fromTuple blogTuple <span>of</span> <span>--just one blog post found- it's a match!</span>
      <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> render500 (toHtml (show err))
      <span>Right</span> blog <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>--extract comments for the blog</span>
        commentsAtom <span>&lt;-</span> handleWebError (atomForAttributeName <span>"comments"</span> blogTuple)
        commentsRel <span>&lt;-</span> handleWebError (relationForAtom commentsAtom)
        comments <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO (toList commentsRel) <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> mapM (handleWebError <span>.</span> fromTuple)<span> ::</span> <span>ActionM</span> [<span>Comment</span>]
        <span>let</span> commentsSorted <span>=</span> sortBy (\c1 c2 <span>-&gt;</span> commentTime c1 <span>`compare`</span> commentTime c2) comments
        render <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After retrieving all the data we need for the page in one query, we extract the singleton blog post, if available, and then extract the comments from the relation-valued attribute as well as sort them by timestamp. Finally, we render the blog info, comments, and a comment form where users can add new comments (elided for brevity).</p>
<p>Our final action adds a comment submitted from the previously-rendered form.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>addComment ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()            
addComment sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  blogid <span>&lt;-</span> param <span>"blogid"</span>
  commentText <span>&lt;-</span> param <span>"contents"</span>
  now <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO getCurrentTime

  <span>case</span> toInsertExpr [<span>Comment</span> {blogTitle <span>=</span> blogid,
                              commentTime <span>=</span> now,
                              contents <span>=</span> commentText }] <span>"comment"</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> handleWebError (<span>Left</span> err)
    <span>Right</span> insertExpr <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>      
      eRet <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO (withTransaction sessionId conn (executeDatabaseContextExpr sessionId conn insertExpr) (commit sessionId conn))
      <span>case</span> eRet <span>of</span>
        <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> handleWebError (<span>Left</span> err)
        <span>Right</span> _ <span>-&gt;</span>
          redirect (TL.fromStrict (<span>"/blog/"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> blogid))</code></pre></div>
<p>We use <code>Tupleable</code>’s <code>toInsertExpr</code> to create a new <code>Comment</code> and insert it into the database. The <code>withTransaction</code> line commits our new comment to the database, if no other errors are raised (such as a constraint or type violation). Finally, we redirect to the blog post page where the user will see his comment added.</p>

<p>Project:M36 offers some unique features for Haskell developers which makes persistence and querying a snap including:</p>
<ul>
<li>full algebraic data type support with normal Haskell data types</li>
<li>easy marshaling between database tuples and Haskell values</li>
<li>relation-valued attributes</li>
<li>a mathematically-sound relational model</li>
<li>an EDSL for relational queries</li>
<li>database-server-side Haskell (not shown in this example)</li>
</ul>

                <div>
                    <p><em><em>Written by </em>Jared Stock,<em> </em>a digital consultant at Arup.</em></p><p>One of the many consequences of COVID-19 in the US is that countless families are having trouble keeping up with rent. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/">According to Moody’s</a>, nearly 12 million renters will owe an average of $5,850 in back rent by January 2021. These renters will face the terrifying prospect of losing their homes in the middle of winter during a pandemic. </p><p>In early September, the Centers for Disease Control issued a national moratorium on evictions until December 31st, 2020. Under this order, tenants can provide a declaration to their landlord that shows that they meet certain conditions, which then prevents the landlord from evicting them. However, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19">as the CDC notes</a> in the order, “this Order does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation…” So, while tenants were protected until then, their rent payments continued to accumulate and they could face eviction if they aren’t able to pay all of the rent back. </p><p>One way to help these families is to simply pay their rent, and that’s exactly what <a href="https://newstorycharity.org/">New Story</a>, a charity based in the Bay Area, set out to do in the spring of 2020. Our team at Arup helped New Story analyze data in the Bay Area to help them make decisions about how to distribute direct payments to families. We looked at a variety of data sources ranging from economic indicators to how vulnerable a county was to COVID-19. We were able to come up with a relative risk index that we used to compare counties and show where the greatest need was. After that work was done, the next logical step was to <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py">share our code and data</a> with the community. </p><p>While some NGOs have people with software and data experience, many more don’t have the skills required to use the open data that exists. Our goal is to make that data and the analysis that we’ve done around evictions available to as many people as possible to help drive decisions and ultimately keep more people in their homes.</p><h2 id="empowering-users-no-code-required">Empowering users, no code required</h2><p>When we initially published our repository and data, users had to have some coding experience in order to use it - which can be intimidating! That immediately reduced the number of people who could potentially use the data. This was a clear opportunity to use <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> to make the data accessible to everyone without needing to understand SQL queries or how to run Python code. Since our initial release was just vanilla Python code, it was easy to start adding functionality by just marking up our code with Streamlit functions. We were able to adapt our existing Python workflows in just a couple hours and deploy using Streamlit sharing in just a couple minutes. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.35.44-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.35.44-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.35.44-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.35.44-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.35.44-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Right off the bat, we were able to turn what were originally command line prompts into visual inputs for users that update as they go through the process. Since this analysis follows a linear sequence of user inputs, Streamlit inputs allow for a much better user experience and allow us to show data at various steps during the analysis in a much nicer format than writing to a command line. We also provide explanation and details right alongside the inputs and data, rather than in a separate README file. </p><p>Streamlit’s input components allowed us to give users a lot more control over what they want to analyze. Instead of making assumptions about housing stock distributions or what features are important to risk, we could surface those assumptions to the user so they could make their own decisions. This level of transparency and control was the inspiration for the other page in the <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py">app</a>: the Data Explorer. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.37.22-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.37.22-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.37.22-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.37.22-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.37.22-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This page is meant to give the users the ability to dive into the data in more detail - allowing a user to look at the values of a single feature in the database and compare the values of two different features. Users can also download the raw data as an Excel document and do whatever they want with it. We’re hoping to add more flexibility to this page in the future, like being able to compare counties in multiple different states. If you have ideas you’d like to see implemented, please add a feature request or better yet, contribute a pull request on our <a href="https://github.com/arup-group/social-data">GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="mapping-it-out">Mapping it out</h2><p>We’ve found that the clearest way for people to understand comparative risk between counties is with a map. Streamlit already has support for simple maps, however, we didn’t just want to plot points; we wanted to show the county shapes. County shapefiles are common and we could get them into our database relatively easily using PostGIS. They get stored in a format called Well Known Binary (WKB), so we need to get them into a format that can be read by pydeck. &nbsp;</p><p>First, I load in the geometry data using Shapely with <code>shapely.wkb.loads()</code>. But immediately we have a problem: the data comes in as a Well Known Text (WTK) object, not as geojson that we can parse. GIS isn't my specialty, so like a good programmer, I looked around Stack Overflow and eventually found some snippets that convert it into sets of coordinates that Python could parse as a dict and then clean it up a bit.</p><figure><pre><code>geo_df['geom'] = geo_df.apply(lambda row: row['geom'].buffer(0), axis=1)
geo_df['geom'] = geo_df.apply(lambda row: gpd.GeoSeries(row['geom']).__geo_interface__, axis=1)
geo_df['coordinates'] = geo_df.apply(lambda row: clean_coordinates(row), axis=1)</code></pre><figcaption>I later found <a href="https://gist.github.com/drmalex07/5a54fc4f1db06a66679e">a better way to do this</a> using Shapely</figcaption></figure><pre><code>def clean_coordinates(row: pd.Series) -&gt; list:
    # combine multipolygon into one object as a single polygon
    for f in row['geom']['features']:
        if f['geometry']['type'] == 'MultiPolygon':
            f['geometry']['type'] = 'Polygon'
            combined = []
            for i in range(len(f['geometry']['coordinates'])):
                combined.extend(list(f['geometry']['coordinates'][i]))
            f['geometry']['coordinates'] = combined

        # flatten coordinates
        f['geometry']['coordinates'] = f['geometry']['coordinates'][0]
    return row['geom']</code></pre><p>Now we have coordinates that define each shape! I add those to our DataFrame and then I can turn everything into nice, friendly geojson for our map. I create a feature collection with each county's name, shape coordinates, and the values (in our case just one) that we want to display.</p><figure><pre><code>def make_geojson(geo_df: pd.DataFrame, features: list) -&gt; dict:
    geojson = {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": []}
    for i, row in geo_df.iterrows():
        feature = row['coordinates']['features'][0]
        props = {"name": row['County Name']}
        for f in features:
            props.update({f: row[f]})
        feature["properties"] = props
        del feature["id"]
        del feature["bbox"]
        feature["geometry"]["coordinates"] = [feature["geometry"]["coordinates"]]
        geojson["features"].append(feature)

    return geojson</code></pre><figcaption>This function creates a new geojson object with our data and the specific features/columns that we want to display</figcaption></figure><p>Now we can finally show this data in our Streamlit app. In this case, I want to give pydeck a DataFrame with only what we want to show on the map. I turn this geojson into a DataFrame and add fill colors as another column, and then I can create a layer for our shapes and pass that into the <code>st.pydeck_chart()</code> function along with a tooltip to show the value of the feature.</p><pre><code>    polygon_layer = pdk.Layer(
        "PolygonLayer",
        geo_df,
        get_polygon="coordinates",
        filled=True,
        stroked=False,
        opacity=0.5,
        get_fill_color='fill_color',
        auto_highlight=True,
        pickable=True,
    )
    # The brackets here are expected for pdk, so string formatting is less friendly
    tooltip = {"html": "&lt;b&gt;County:&lt;/b&gt; {name} &lt;/br&gt;" + "&lt;b&gt;" + str(map_feature) + ":&lt;/b&gt; {" + str(map_feature) + "}"}

    r = pdk.Deck(
        layers=[polygon_layer],
        initial_view_state=view_state,
        map_style=pdk.map_styles.LIGHT,
        tooltip=tooltip
    )
    st.pydeck_chart(r)</code></pre><p>Once our data is properly formatted, turning it into a map is pretty straightforward:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.41.06-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.41.06-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.41.06-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.41.06-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-11.41.06-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>And now we have our data flowing into a nice map!</figcaption></figure><p>Because the functions to create the map are generalized, it makes expanding on them much easier. For example, if we want to create a map with multiple layers, we could update the existing <code>make_map</code> function to accept a list of features to map and then create multiple of <code>Layer</code>s instead of just one. We can use these functions like a component in React or Angular to show different information in multiple places. In fact, I did exactly that to create map view on the Data Explorer page to allow users to see any feature by just changing the inputs to the functions.</p><h2 id="making-data-accessible">Making data accessible</h2><p>This project initially aimed to collect disparate data sources and make our analysis easier for anyone, but not everyone has the Python and data skills to use it on its own. Streamlit allowed us to replace a scary command line interface with a more familiar and functional web app, hopefully allowing more users to interact with data. It also gave us the ability to show the data in more interactive and intuitive ways than we could if users had to run the project locally. While we hope this will help people address the eviction crisis, we think this data also can help address other social problems in policy-making, planning, and other fields. </p><p>Arup decided to make this project open because we believe we can have a bigger impact by working together, so we’re eager to work with the community to make this tool more useful. If you have ideas for new functionality, <a href="https://github.com/arup-group/social-data/issues">let us know</a> or better yet, contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/arup-group/social-data">repository</a>. You can find the app <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py">here</a>. The coming months could be a very scary time for lots of people, and we hope …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>While many Amazon warehouse workers in Europe have unionized, its brutalized, underpaid, routinely maimed US workforce remains tragically unorganized, thanks to the US's weak labor laws that make forming a union far harder than at any time since the Gilded Age.</p>
<p>But all that may be about to change: 6000 warehouse workers in BHM1, the massive Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, AL, will vote next month on a push to unionize under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/15/948819324/amazon-warehouse-workers-to-decide-whether-to-form-companys-first-u-s-union">https://www.npr.org/2021/01/15/948819324/amazon-warehouse-workers-to-decide-whether-to-form-companys-first-u-s-union</a></p>
<p>Amazon, like other tech giants, is absolutely reliant on building and maintaining a competitive advantage by exploiting technology to drive wages ever downward while ducking responsibility for harming workers.</p>
<p>Big Tech is pants-wettingly afraid of unionization, and that goes double for any solidarity between high-paid tech workers and misclassified/outsourced warehouse workers and other "unskilled" laborers.</p>
<p>Amazon has gone so far as to hire the Pinkertons, renowned as some of history's most violent anti-worker terrorists, to bust unionization drives in its shops:</p>

<p>But while the Pinkertons are engaging in covert surveillance, infiltration, and retaliation, Amazon is also running a soft-power op called #DoItWithoutDues, grounded in the idiotic lie that unions cost workers more than they gain:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/">https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/</a></p>
<p>The Tech Workers Coalition has fired back with a debunking site, #DoItWithRealPower, that copies the layout from Amazon's astroturf site and rebuts it, point by point:</p>
<p><a href="https://justdue.it/">https://justdue.it/</a></p>
<p>This would be a super-fun, gnarly copyright/fair use case (law school profs, take note), but the substance is even more fascinating: you won't pay dues until your union gets a contract, which will get you higher pay.</p>
<p>Not just pay, but also an effective grievance procedure to address Amazon warehouses' manifestly unsafe working conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://bamazonunion.org/amazons-working-conditions-are-not-safe">https://bamazonunion.org/amazons-working-conditions-are-not-safe</a></p>
<p>"On average, unionized workers earn 19% more than non-unionized workers so, if you make the average $31k a year, a union could win you an increase in YOUR PAYCHECK of $5,900 annually. That’s a whole lot more dinners, school supplies, gifts, and dignity."</p>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

		<p>Real time, text communications are not the invention of email. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, long distance was expensive and fax very slow. Vulcan needed an alternate method to communicate in real time for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two offices needed written communications on production schedules and preparation of quotations. For example, the factory was required to send a periodic telex to inform the executive office of the status of every back order in the system.</li>
<li>Since a third of Vulcan’s sales volume was international, it needed to communicate rapidly with its customers, both during the sales process and to respond rapidly during breakdowns.</li>
<li>Its field service force needed a way to obtain quick answers, especially when in places like Southeast Asia where the time difference made voice telephone difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telex was the obvious answer. A more general description of the technology and its history is given below; here we will concentrate on Vulcan’s use of telex as a business tool.</p>

These were basically electromechanical terminals using roll paper printed on by a cylindrical drum with the letters on it (typewriters with a ball printer used the same idea, but the results looked better.) On the left was the paper tape punch. For most telexes, one composed them recording the telex on the paper tape, which encoded the data with a system of punched holes, similar to a player piano roll. When the telex was sent, once the connection was made, the paper tape was played back to the receiving telex. In this way the message would not be hindered by slow typing with mistakes. It was also possible to leave the tape punch on to record receiving telexes as well for retransmission. (<em>A fictional enactment of using the telex–and the possible result–is found in the novel <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/633941">The Ten Weeks</a>.</em>)&nbsp; A telex machine similar to Vulcan’s is shown in action below.</p>

<p>Telex could also be used in a “dialogue” mode similar to instant messaging or IRC chat, but Vulcan seldom used it in this way. With this, the initiator of the dialogue could ring the bell at the recipient’s end to get their attention.</p>

Since they were around Christmastime, somebody hopefully put in a “Joyeux Noel” somewhere in there.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telexes were identified by the telex number and the answerback. In the example above, when Straits Engineers sent the “Who are you?” our machine responded with its answerback, VULCAN WPB. The sending machine then replied with its own before going into the message, generally adding its telex number as well. Thus, “STREL RS” was the sender’s answerback and “23644” was the telex number. (The “RS” identified the telex as from Singapore; this is the <a title="direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rfc1394.pdf">direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier</a>. The answerback is the key feature; it verifies to the sender that the recipient is actually receiving what’s sent. Once the recipient’s number is dialled, the cross (<a href="https://www.vulcanhammer.org/what-is-the-gospel/">the usual sign of getting access</a>) appeared with the “who are you?” request. If connected, the recipient’s answerback came up. This enabled telexes to have legal standing.</p>
<p>A little figuring for inflation with the bill shown, however, will show that the messages, generally not very long, were rather expensive. This led to a lot of people using abbreviations in telexes (such as “u” for “you”, very similar to what you see in text messaging today.) Vulcan’s people never quite got the hang of this. Still, telexes were received in real time, or at least greeted their recipients when they arrived the next morning, which is more than “snail mail” could do then or now.</p>
<p>Telex machines were virtually universal with Vulcan’s international business associates. One Vulcan agent boasted of his own status by informing us that he had his own machine, while some of his competitors used “the public telex!”</p>
<p>One of the more intensive uses of telex took place in 1981 with the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/a-fistful-of-yuan-vulcan-in-china-1981-3/">negotiations and sale of the 560 package to the Petroleum Corporation of the People’s Republic of China</a>. The Chinese were as detailed in their demands of quotation presentation as they were in those for technical information. After a day of negotiations, we composed and sent a telex with our requests back to the U.S., where the day was just started. The next morning we would have our reply and resumed our negotiations. (Telephone calls in and out of China at that time were very difficult, and with a long list of spare parts and prices, would not have done the job.)</p>
<p>After that Vulcan replaced its telex machine (the Florida office was closed) with a newer model, with a dot matrix printer (still on a roll) and a screen terminal for composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless throughout the 1980’s Vulcan’s use of the telex was in decline for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980’s shrunk Vulcan’s international business considerably.</li>
<li>Vulcan obtained CCITT Group 4 faxes in the mid 1980’s, as did its customers. Combined with new economies in long distance service (domestic and international,) fax proved a more practical way to communicate with its customers, both within and outside of the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the early 1990’s telex was pretty much a thing of the past at Vulcan. In 1995, Vulcan obtained its first email address, and the cycle of sending text electronically started all over again. But telex had paved the way.</p>

<h4><a name="kimberlin"></a>Telex and TWX History<br>
Donald E. Kimberlin 1996</h4>
<p><a title="(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/haynes-notes.pdf">(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)</a></p>
<p>Telex certainly should be called the original form of E-Mail. Far from “dead” on a global basis, UN reports published in the “Britannica Book of the Year” indicate there are about three million Telex lines around the globe. Contrary to the impression international telephone people like to create, direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world’s political entities than does telephone. This has been the case for many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex. The suspected reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been done, too. Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)</p>
<p>Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automobile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised as a means to distribute military command and control messages and data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing machinery. What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges. The original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.</p>
<p>There was one major difference: Intercity transmission facilities were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25) telegraph channels bearing Telex. The economics are obvious, and probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.</p>
<p>In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages … and it did. Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as “type A Telex signaling.” It is still used that way in many nations. In those you will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial. When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S., it adopted the original style and Type A signaling. Similarly, many other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France and Belgium as well as others. Meantime, (I think it was L. M. Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations adopted what became known as “Type B” Telex. By this time, the CCITT had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50 Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in upspeeding. In this writer’s experience, Cuba and Pakistan are remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Telex grew around the world very rapidly … long before automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel usage. Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with …</p></div></article></div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    
    
  
    <p>In this paper from Google, the authors release a model that decomposes images of objects into a set of images, each of which contain one individual object. They train models on a specific dataset, CLEVR, which contains synthetic images of simple geometric objects and release the models. Here we run their pretrained model on an example image from the CLEVR dataset:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*n7JkSFvi99vIVEQ8biBDkA.gif">

    <p>So far so good. But how general is this model? Can we use it to segment other kinds of objects? Here’s the result when we use an image of furniture: the model does not throw any errors, but it fails horribly:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*q0GwW-jP5NvIn5TrupGfJw.gif">

    <p>Okay, so perhaps the model only works with geometric objects. Let’s make a slight adjustment to the original image we used, and increase the brightness of its background. As a user, we would reasonably expect the model to be fairly robust to such simple transformations — certainly our human ability to decompose objects is. However, the model is anything but robust:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*WC7TAORpQdbTm8HRzx2v8A.gif">

    <p>I should be clear here — I don’t think that the model is at fault, nor the authors. The model works very well on the task that it was trained and tested on: decomposing objects in the original CLEVR dataset. However, as a user of the pretrained model, I do not know a priori whether the model will handle other kinds of images. There is no contract that tells me the model should only be used with the original images from the CLEVR dataset.</p>

    You might be thinking that these models are designed for very specific datasets; they are not meant to be generally used with real-world images. However, the situation can be even worse for models designed to work with natural images…

    <h3>3. When input data needs to satisfy other hard-to-define constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Unfolding the Alternating Optimization for Blind Super Resolution
    </p>
    
    

    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.
    </p>

                    <p>A little over a year ago I released a paid course on serverless Flask. I just pulled down the paywall, so now everyone can access it for free at <a href="https://compellingpython.com/serverless_flask">compellingpython.com</a>!</p><p>Here is an excerpt from the introduction where I give my reasons for writing the guide:</p><blockquote>1. I think serverless Flask is a great, inexpensive option for applications that need to auto-scale quickly and/or have extremely bursty usage (for instance, a reporting tool that is only used on the first of every month, or an application that only accepts submissions for small windows of time throughout the year). It's also a wonderful option for people who want to deploy quick one-off web apps that can stay up indefinitely with no monthly cost if people aren't using them.</blockquote><blockquote>2. I want to show you how to build a complete Python web application that is actually deployable and usable. Many books use examples without full source code, whereas I want to demonstrate how to build a real (albeit simple) application from start to finish. All the source code is available as an appendix at the end of the guide (in addition to a github repo <a href="https://github.com/JoeStech/compelling-python-profile-app">here</a>) and relevant excerpts will be presented throughout.</blockquote><p>If you find the guide useful feel free to drop me a line at joe@cloudconsultant.dev!</p>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="504" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/screen-shot-2020-01-04-at-18.52.52.png" alt="5 Simple Rules to Parse Japanese Grammar with EBNF notation"><figcaption>Extension of Rule 2 (JAR  = ) by adding ” | JAR* noun-no no ” ensures recursive reading.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>



<h2>Visuals to Help Expound</h2>

<p>Pictured Above: Any number of Complete Bunsetsu Jars (means a Jar with contents and a Lid =  a particle) plus a Sentence-Final-Fitter make a Japanese sentence.</p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly63ijYzrhVjVNf7b7a/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly63ijYzrhVjVNf7b7a/v1</a></p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="433" src="http://articles.japanesecomplete.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/etym-altar-5.png" alt=""></figure>



<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions).

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Links: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO8tIMQHFig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J3bI261tBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 2</a></p>
<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 2015, I discovered a surprising security vulnerability that allowed you to run malicious JavaScript code on the Google search engine results page, which might be one of the most secure pages on the internet given how much daily traffic it recieves. It wasn’t until <a href="#the-fix">4 years later (or 2019) that they finally closed the case on it</a> and I could share it without breaking my nondisclosure agreement with Google.</p><p>This sounds like a lot like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS attack</a>, which you would imagine Google would sanitize for, but it’s not and it’ll soon become clear why as I explain.</p><p>I was on Google searching for something like <em>“text-to-speech javascript libraries”</em>. I went from the Google search results page to clicking the first result, back to the Google search results page, to clicking on the second result, back to the Google search results page, etc. What I noticed was that my speakers kept making a clicking noise, like they were turning on and off—but just for a second.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/google-search.png" loading="lazy" width="340"></figure><p>I thought maybe there was some other program running on my computer or that my speakers were busted, but I realized it happened everytime I went to the Google search results page for this query. It also happened everytime I went to the first search results page, which was of a company that had a demo of their text-to-speech solution on it.</p><p>I figured the company’s page was loading their text-to-speech engine, that seemed to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">SpeechSynthesis interface of the WebSpeech API</a>, and that’s why the speakers were turning on. But why were they on the Google page? That seemed like Google was maybe pulling in code on the search results page from the company’s page. That should never happen though, surely Google sanitizes anything that ever gets displayed on their pages from containing HTML or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>This seemed like a plausible attack vector if there was some bug that allowed you to bring arbitrary code on to the Google search results page and a huge one at that.</p><p>I dumped the source code of the search results page and started looking at the HTML around the search result, but it didn’t look like any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or HTML tags were making it through. I started looking for instances of the company’s domain and found something like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"prerender"</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://thecompanyspage.com/example"</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I was not familiar with <code>rel="prerender"</code> myself in 2015. Indeed, it seemed to be some sort of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-resource-hints-20150717/#dfn-prerender">new mechanism for pre-fetching and pre-loading a page</a> to speed up page transistions and load times as an optimization.</p><p>Google seemed to have invented <code>rel="prerender"</code> to prefetch and load the first search result in the background, so that when you clicked on the first search result (as most users do), it would instantly be ready for viewing.</p><p>The <code>rel="prerender"</code> has to execute JavaScript to load dynamic content, but it wasn’t blocking the WebSpeech API from playing audio possibly. Luckily for Google, the pre-rendered content is loaded in its own origin and, therefore, sensitive resources like cookies on the Google page were not at risk from being harvested by attackers like they would be in an XSS attack.</p><p>After learning this, the next step was to prove this out with my own website on Google’s search results page and see what I could make of it.</p><p>I needed a long obscure phrase that I could get the #1 Google search result spot for and that no one would accidently stumble upon so I could keep the vulnerability relatively secret until Google could fix it. I chose the apt phrase “Alphabet Spoke to Me In My Dreams” and purchased the <code>alphabetspoketomeinmydreams.xyz</code> domain name (now expired) that would show up as the first Google search result for the phrase. This was around the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/technology/google-alphabet-restructuring.html">Google restructured into Alphabet Inc</a>.</p><p>The first malicious thing I could think to do was to “vandalize” the Google search results page with one of those “win a prize” scams pretending to be Google to phish their users. I also thought it would be sufficiently creepy to show how you were able to access standard information about the user like their location, ISP, IP address while being prerendered and speak it back to them. I know <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/iZ6bamP8wZk?t=46">Dwight Schrute would be scared of that</a>.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFlquq0GcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio on the Google search results page.</figcaption></figure><p>So this looks pretty bad, but you would think that a user might notice if they click on the first result that it was a 3rd-party page causing the audio to play not Google right? Yes, except you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hidden"><code>document.hidden</code> property</a> to detect prerender mode and condition your code so that it only runs in <code>rel="prerender"</code> mode on the Google search engine results page! This creates a pretty robust appearance for impersonation as nothing happens if you go to the page directly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.hidden) {
  <span>// The page is being loaded in rel="prerender", run the WebSpeech API code
</span><span></span>} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The page is being loaded normally, don't do anything
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="chrome-vulnerability">Chrome Vulnerability</h2><p>While testing this, I found that this doesn’t only work on the Google search results page, but it turns out Chrome also “prerenders” the first result of the autocomplete in the URL search bar. Therefore, you can start playing WebSpeech audio without even having a page loaded in the browser frame.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqyOnzGDRlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Chrome Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio in the Chrome browser before any page is loaded in the browser at all when triggered by a user typing in a search into the URL search bar.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="denial-of-service-possibilities">Denial-of-Service Possibilities</h2><p>After testing other APIs, it seemed clear that only the WebSpeech API was making it through to the parent page. Things like <code>alert()</code> boxes were deferred from being visible until the page was actually loaded. But it also seemed clear that, while certain APIs were not available, JavaScript was running unrestricted. What happens if you do an infinite loop on the prerendered page?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>while</span> (<span>true</span>) {
  <span>// Infinite loop
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, you could “denial of service” the Google search results page from being displayed. This is not an attack on their servers, but rather you lock up the user’s browser so Google’s search results page cannot load.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/dos.png" loading="lazy" alt="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" title="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" width="600"><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service</span>
Preventing the Google search results page from even loading by infinite looping in the prerendered page.</figcaption></figure><p>I shared the live example and a locally reproducible example of the vulnerability to Google.</p><h2 id="googles-response">Google’s Response</h2><p>Google’s security team responded promptly and professionally within 24 hours and decided to award a monetary reward for the vulnerability. The Chrome team did not dual-award since Google had already awarded. The Chrome team, however, were responsible for fixing the issue. I was not able to share this bug for quite some time due to the nondisclosure terms of Google’s vulnerability program.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2><p>The bug report and discussion is now public and visible <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=520275">here</a>.</p><p>I was suprised at how long it took to resolve and how difficult the fix seemed to be. It proved very difficult to break this API out from being enabled in the prerender context. In fact, at one point, one of the developers mentioned: <em>“This is currently our oldest &gt;= Medium severity security bug."</em> It was not until 2019 that they finally closed the bug after prerendering support was completely dropped from Chrome, due to it causing headaches like this, and the proof-of-concept could no longer be reproduced.</p><p>So, it seems premature optimization like <code>rel="prerender"</code> being the root of all evil isn’t just true because you might spend time <a href="https://xkcd.com/1691/">optimizing something that isn’t worth it</a>, but also because it likely increases the complexity and surface area for serious security bugs.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>O</span>n the evening of October 9, 2013, 50-year-old elementary school teacher Laura Ramírez was run over by a car and killed on Avenida Dr. José María Vertiz near downtown Mexico City. The vehicle fled the scene.</p>



<p>Authorities contacted Ramírez’s only close family member: her daughter, Veronica, then a 22-year-old student. They asked her to come to the prosecutor’s office to identify her mother’s body and give a statement. Veronica arrived around 10 p.m. that night, accompanied by an uncle and a handful of friends. She had no idea how the process worked — that, for instance, she was entitled to legal representation and counseling. Through her shock and grief, however, Veronica had the presence of mind to realize that there were security cameras at the intersection where her mother had been killed. </p>



<p>Mexico City is home to an enormous urban surveillance system, the <em>Centro de Comando, Control, Cómputo, Comunicaciones y Contacto Ciudadano</em>, otherwise known as the C5. Because the hit-and-run had occurred on a major road, the system’s cameras were in place to capture it. “There were at least four along the path the car took,” she remembers. She immediately mentioned this to the officials. Thanks to the footage, she hoped, the police would at least be able to identify the car, track down the driver and catch her mother’s killer. An officer responded that given the gravity of the crime, the footage would automatically be set aside. Veronica pushed: Did she need to do anything to secure the videos? The officer assured her that it was all part of official protocol: The police would request the evidence and add it to the investigation file.</p>



<p>As Veronica stood outside the office between interviews, a man who identified himself as a legal aide for the prosecutor’s office approached her and asked if they could speak privately. Veronica found the request strange, but her friends encouraged her to go, and she followed the man into a private office. He asked her to repeat her account of the incident, which he took down with a brown marker on sheets of scrap paper. “There are two things you need to do,” he told her. “You’re going to need the videos, and you have to take them to the morgue. For both of those things, I’m going to charge you 4,000 pesos (roughly $200).” The demand caught Veronica by surprise. She argued, but he gave her an ultimatum: The recordings, he pointed out, were erased once a week, and they could easily vanish. “Either they’ll get lost, or you’ll give me the money.”</p>



<p>Initially, Veronica refused to pay the bribe. She didn’t even have enough to bury her mother. But friends who had accompanied her to the station managed to scrape together 2,500 of the 4,000 pesos, which they gave to the aide. The bribe would at least ensure, they hoped, that authorities would secure the C5 footage and solve the hit-and-run.</p>



<p>But when Veronica returned to the office to follow up on the investigation weeks later, officials claimed that the videos weren’t available, despite their previous promises. Eventually, they informed Veronica that they did have two relevant clips from that night. One showed the headlights of an approaching car, but just before it came into view, the camera turned to face another direction. The other captured the intersection several hours after the accident took place. Neither involved the car that killed Veronica’s mother.</p>



<p>The officials, Veronica learned, hadn’t filed the necessary paperwork. Instead of requesting the five relevant recordings, they had requested only two. “Because I didn’t give them the full amount of money, it was like the fee only covered what they got me,” she recalls. And since private citizens can’t solicit C5 videos, she had no other recourse. Two years later,<strong> </strong>with no further progress made, the case was closed. It was classified as “unresolved” and, moreover, as “unresolvable.” Instead of helping her find her mother’s killer, Veronica laments, “this technology, which is supposed to be an instrument of justice, became a chip for extortion.”</p>

<p>Since the 2009 inauguration of the C5 <a href="http://www.caepccm.df.gob.mx/antecedentes">(then known as CAEPCCM or C4i4</a>), Mexico City’s authorities have prided themselves on having one of the most ambitious and sophisticated video surveillance systems in the world. The C5 <a href="https://www.c5.cdmx.gob.mx/">encompasses</a> more than 15,000 units, with more than 30,000 cameras, 12,700 loudspeakers, and 15,000 panic buttons, spread over 1,485 square kilometers.<strong> </strong>Each unit includes environmental sensors to detect unusual weather, seismic events, gunshots, and explosions. Everything runs on a fiber-optic network, and data is channeled to control rooms and mobile response units linked to 911 call centers and a missing-persons hotline. In addition, there are four command-and-control centers (known as C2), which focus on specific neighborhoods, and mobile units that can be deployed to monitor large public events. On major highways, cameras are equipped with software to automatically detect license plates. The city has spent more than MX$13 billion (about $660 million) in total on the infrastructure and software, and in 2019, another billion pesos (about $50 million) was budgeted to replace and update cameras.</p>



<p>Mexico City proper has nearly 9 million inhabitants, and when one includes the surrounding metropolitan area — a region nearly ten times the size of New York City — that number reaches 22 million. Within it, one finds densely packed self-built settlements, rural farming communities barely reachable by paved roads, and some of the most desirable real estate in Latin America. Climbing property values, however, are a relatively new phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mexico City, formerly known as DF, the Distrito Federal, was notorious for its pollution and high crime rates, which earned it the nickname “El Defectuoso” — the Defective.</p>



<p>As the city’s authorities worked to change the capital’s image, the C5 was supposed to fulfill a world-class promise. In exchange for near-constant surveillance, residents would see their home become cleaner, safer, more data-driven, a destination for both tourists and capital. But that hasn’t happened. Mexico City’s district attorney estimated last year that <a href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/04/27/capital/030n1cap?partner=rss">94% of crimes in</a> her jurisdiction go unreported. Of the fraction of homicides that have been reported, more than<a href="https://www.impunidadcero.org/uploads/app/articulo/131/contenido/1575312021S66.pdf"> 86% remain unresolved</a>. Furthermore, only a tiny number of police investigations involve evidence taken from C5 cameras. According to an ex-C5 official, Rafael Prieto Curiel, only 0.002% of crimes committed in Mexico City are captured on tape.</p>



<p>A handful of high-profile cases over the years have relied on the C5 system. But it’s far more common, cliché even, for police to tell victims that the relevant camera wasn’t working at the moment of the crime, or, as Veronica experienced, that the footage is no longer available. According to an as-yet-unpublished report from the think tanks Data Cívica and R3D, approximately 60% of crimes in the city take place within 200 meters of a C5 camera, but police use C5 footage in less than 1% of investigations. This isn’t the result of technical problems: According to government data, approximately 14,000 of the 15,000 modules are functioning at any given time. Nor is it a matter of storage capacity; most cameras auto-delete every seven days, and official protocol dictates that all videos related to a crime be saved once a report has been filed.</p>



<p>The C5 is a powerful tool. But like any tool, it’s only as useful as the person who wields it. Just as the C5 can help solve investigations, it can also be leveraged by police and prosecutors’ offices to support existing forms of criminality. In Veronica’s case, C5 footage became collateral for extortion. In other instances, police have been known to leak confidential photos and videos to the crime press, the <em>nota roja</em>. “If the videos benefit the police or the prosecution, they’re leaked to the media,” says Alejandro Jiménez, a criminal defense lawyer who has come up against the system’s limitations in court. “If the videos make them look bad, the police disappear the footage.” To those allegations, officials tend to repeat the same lines: <em>The cameras weren’t working. The footage was lost. That incident never happened. </em>And when police themselves are involved in crimes, impunity is all but guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>Late on a</strong> Thursday night in February 2017, Carlos — whose name has been changed because of fear of retaliation — stumbled out of El Botellón, an upscale tapas bar in the trendy Condesa neighborhood. The 26-year-old had been drinking with friends since the afternoon. They had started at a nearby cantina, then migrated to the bar, and by the time Carlos called his Uber, the day had taken its toll on him. While waiting for his ride on Tamaulipas, an avenue home to a smattering of trendy bars, cafes, and restaurants, Carlos tripped and fell onto the sidewalk. As he pulled himself up, two police officers approached and began to berate him. “They told me I was way too drunk, that it was public indecency,” he recalls. The officers grabbed him, one from behind, and attempted to wrestle him into a police car. He felt a blow to the face. After that, he remembers nothing.</p>



<p>It was still dark when Carlos woke up and found himself sprawled on the asphalt of a residential street. His legs ached, his face felt tender, and his leather jacket was matted with blood. As he gathered himself, Carlos registered his surroundings: He was in the upper-middle-class Nápoles neighborhood — several kilometers south of the bar where he had been drinking. Between the bar and the spot where he had awoken, if they’d taken the most direct route, Carlos and the police would have passed a few dozen C5 cameras at least. On his way to work, still visibly injured, Carlos ran into two coworkers who, shocked by his appearance, called for emergency help.<strong> </strong>A police …</p></div></div>

<p>To the average person, weather forecasts inform whether or not they need to bring an umbrella to the office. But to some, it can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Organizations like the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) sit at the center of a web of highly sensitive operations, providing them weather predictions and reports. Whether that is for space agencies, natural disaster response, or the military, the accuracy of their forecasts are core to the decision making process.</p>

<p>So, it’s no wonder the ECMWF manages one of the world’s largest supercomputing clusters to run computationally-expensive predictive models. This post goes in-depth on how the ECMWF used Teleport to grant secure shell access to scientists and researchers without encumbering them with esoteric ssh commands and configuration.</p>

<p>Teleport is an OSS tool that consolidates SSH access across all environments, implements security, meets compliance requirements, and has complete visibility with a developer-friendly solution that doesn’t get in the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ecmwf-case-study-1.png" width="60%" alt="ecmwf logo"></p>

<h3 id="about-ecmwf-https-www-ecmwf-int">About <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/">ECMWF</a></h3>

<p>The European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting is an independent organization, supported by participating member states. Hosting one of the largest supercomputing facilities and meteorological data stores in the world, the ECMWF provides invaluable forecasting predictions and reporting. The organization is a key component of Europe’s meteorological infrastructure, working with various national weather services to inform weather conditions for seaports, emergency response, airports, and space agencies. For nearly 50 years, the ECMWF has remained Europe’s foremost pooling of meteorological resources.</p>

<h2 id="reconsidering-secure-remote-access">Reconsidering Secure Remote Access</h2>

<p>The ECMWF’s 10-year goals, set in 2016, had ambitious mandates; one of which required moving their datacenter from Reading, England to Bologna, Italy. The relocation was a massive undertaking, requiring multinational collaboration to move and construct a state-of-the-art data center in a 9,000 square meter facility. The infrastructure team at the ECMWF would use this opportunity to refurbish outdated services, one of which included a remote access service for members that needed to connect a shell to ECMWF’s computing powerhouse.</p>

<p>As with most growing organizations, the ECMWF’s existing in-house solution, ecAccess, became difficult to maintain. Design choices from a decade ago prevented the adoption of new technologies like OIDC, and changing dependencies required more customer support resources. To achieve the goals set in the Roadmap to 2025 initiative, the infrastructure team would go on to uproot ecAccess and transplant it with a modern remote access tool. One that would improve security, provide greater visibility, and most importantly, scale with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key priority for ECMWF is on the one hand to remain an attractive proposition for the best scientists in the world, whilst at the same time ensuring it can provide them with the best-fitted computing capability to deliver our core mission.

<h2 id="accessing-supercomputing-clusters">Accessing Supercomputing Clusters</h2>

<h3 id="ecaccess-legacy-access-tooling">ecAccess - Legacy Access Tooling</h3>

<p>The two computational behemoths housed by the ECMWF included a high performance computing Linux cluster and two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_XC40">Cray XC40s</a> that constitute its supercomputer. Capable of up to hundreds of teraflops in processing power,  these facilities are utilized by ECMWF’s users to perform data science and build machine learning models.  Typically these jobs required remote shell access via SSH, which also exposes a way for hackers to siphon supercomputing resources. A recent example was the coordinated attempt to use other European supercomputers for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/supercomputers-hacked-across-europe-to-mine-cryptocurrency/">mining cryptocurrencies</a>.  For the ECMWF, the stakes are higher with large volumes of their data directly supporting emergency services. Days or even weeks of downtime is not tolerable.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ecmwf-case-study-2.png" width="100%" alt="eaccess architecture diagram"></p>

<p><small>Figure 1: ecAccess Architecture</small>
Running a standard ssh agent, scientists from all around Europe could connect to the ecAccess gateway and would be greeted with a login prompt. At the bottom of the CLI, users are asked to enter a one time password they receive from an authenticator app. Despite being a preferred method of primary authentication, SSH keys were not given to any users - the risk being too high to leave keys across thousands of local machines and let them be copied, misplaced, or misused.</p>

<h3 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h3>

<p>Having matured into a vital coordinated effort across Europe, the ECMWF expanded their reach and computational capability. Among them would include a growing  staff of sysadmins and analysts supporting over 500 distinct internal systems to aid the work of thousands of personnel from an increasing list of member states.</p>

<p>An important build vs. buy variable is the cost of maintaining internally-built software. The problem with this calculation is that, over time, costs may unpredictably change. Consider a couple of the reasons the ECMWF felt this pain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgraded Dependencies</strong> - Having built custom ssh libraries for ecAccess, the infrastructure team had to keep pace with updates to the protocol and maintain forward compatibility. <strong>Support Resources</strong> - Over time, two vectors forced scarce support resources to be diverted to ecAccess. The ECMWF’s growth brought in a diverse base of users. They were faced with language barriers and users that did not have the requisite knowledge to use ecAccess without a GUI. Amplifying an already complicated process, ecAccess documentation grew more confusing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Outdated Technology</strong> -  Nowadays it is quite common to use SAML or OIDC protocols to authenticate against an identity provider and MFA with physical tokens like Yubikeys. Having barely existed at the time, ecAccess could not adopt either open standard. Instead, the ECMWF was bound to a single authentication flow for decades - entering a OTP for every shell connection - while the rest of the world took advantage of  single-sign on. Amplifying this frustration, significant resources had been fed into updating the ECMWF’s identity management systems, something they cannot fully integrate with until authentication can be decoupled from ecAccess.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-modern-secure-access-means">What Modern Secure Access Means</h2>

<p>ECMWF had some precise requirements guiding their search for potential successor technologies: Not only did the upgrade have to be resistant to the pressures building inside ecAccess, but could fit within the constraints the ECMWF worked under.</p>

      <h4>Backward Compatibility</h4>
   </td>
    <td>
        <h3>OpenSSH Clients of Any Flavor</h3>
        <p>Being a public utility, the ECMWF’s computational power is accessed by employees at third parties. With limited control over what client software is run, the infrastructure team had to stay compatible with a range of different OpenSSH and OS versions.</p>

        <h3>Locked Down Environments</h3>
        <p>The users that constitute the ECMWF ecosystem largely consist of mission critical and life-saving public infrastructure. The cybersecurity standards upheld at these organizations often batten down computing environments. Any client-side software would need to be minimal and militantly secure.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
   <td>  
      <h4>Session Logins</h4>
   </td>
   <td>
      <h3>Keys without Key Management</h3>
      <p>Key based authentication allows for clear session logins and leave key fingerprints. However, issuing SSH keys was never a viable option of the ECMWF. Keys would have to be distributed to a changing user base with little control over what happens to those keys. Instead, they employed the one-time password authentication pattern.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="transparency-in-open-source">Transparency in Open Source</h2>

<p>Like most Linux shops, especially one that creates and freely distributes software themself, the staff at ECMWF had a healthy appreciation for open-source software. So when they first came across Teleport as a possible fit, they immediately went to the Github repo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transparency is a big thing, we can look for ourselves and say ‘Yes, that’s [Teleport] quality and it’s done by people who know what they’re doing.’
<br><small>Oliver Gorwits - Manager at ECMWF</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As engineers, the team felt reassured in knowing they could collaborate with a community that would continually improve the software. But as a service operator, the ECMWF needed commercial support - someone to pick up the phone.</p>

<h2 id="teleport-for-secure-remote-access">Teleport for Secure Remote Access</h2>

<p>In the end, the infrastructure team at ECMWF chose Teleport as their solution. Adding some color to this decision, recall that the ECMWF evaluated tools that met minimum requirements and improved both security and ease of use.</p>

<p>Privileged Tesla owners whose cars are equipped with the limited release Full Self-Driving Beta software are constantly updating the world with the improvements happening with each release. The latest version of the Autopilot FSD Beta is 2020.48.35.1 (V10 / Build 10) — we have found some interesting test videos from this update that demonstrate how Tesla’s self-driving program is progressing.</p>



<p>Since it’s launch back in October last year, Tesla is releasing an update of FSD Beta every week or two. The latest update is the 10th installment of FSD Beta that’s why it’s called V10 or Build 10.</p>



<p>Kim Paquette, who is the owner of a unicorn silver Tesla Model 3, is one of the most consistent <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a> testers out there. She has been driving her <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Model 3</a> on FSD Beta almost across the entire United States, let’s see what she has evaluated this time.</p>

<h2>Right-turn at a difficult intersection</h2>



<p>According to Kim, FSD Beta was previously not able to handle this tricky intersection at all but with the latest update (Build 10), Autopilot handled the scenario in a much better way. However, she had to intervene at the end to avoid touching the curb on the left side of the road.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>9-minute drive at night with zero interventions </h2>



<p>Kim wrote the following in the video description of this FSD Beta drive on  Build 10:</p>



<blockquote><p>9 minutes Of a 12 minute perfect Tesla FSD Beta drive. Edited a portion (on a straight road, nothing happening) where a took a phone call. This build is the first time I have gone from the beginning point to end without so much even a nudge on the accelerator.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Improved roundabout performance</h2>



<p>James Locke is another beta tester for FSD Beta, he reports that with Build 10, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Tesla Autopilot</a>‘s ability to handle roundabouts has improved. This time FSD Beta 10 handles this roundabout more quickly with increased confidence.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>Navigating a winding road</h2>



<p>This time, Kim puts <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a> 48.35.1 (build 10) through a series of winding city streets of Portsmouth, Rhode Island. She says:</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSDBeta?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#FSDBeta</a> in a twisty neighborhood in Portsmouth — pretty straightforward. At the other place you asked about, it stopped as if there were a stop sign, as it should have (because there should be a stop sign there. Weird.)</p></blockquote>

</div></figure>



<p>In the near future, Tesla will be fully <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/30/tesla-migrating-fsd-decisions-neural-nets/">migrating to Neural Net for Autopilot decision making</a> instead of using built-in programming logic, a Tesla hacker has discovered this looking at the backend code. This will eliminate the need for waiting for a software update to improve the Autopilot decision making and self-driving experience.</p>



<p>Even with the current decision-making process, one Tesla Model 3 owner was able to <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/01/tesla-model-3-autopilot-fsd-beta-sf-to-los-angeles/">travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Autopilot</a> FSD Beta without interventions — amazing.</p>



<h2>A 30-minute drive on FSD Beta</h2>



<blockquote><p>30 minutes unedited drive on Build 10 around Newport and Middletown, RI. Overall, build 10 is a huge leap from any previous build. But, areas that need improvement: </p><p>– Yielding logic is still being tweaked. My one disengagement was yielding entering a rotary. My car stopped yielding (and would instead stop) at this rotary starting with build 8. This time, it didn’t feel like it was going to yield so I intervened. </p><p>– Creeping logic has greatly improved over previous builds, but still being worked on. Does great on some roads, not on others. </p><p>– Confidence in turning – most turns are great, but sometimes it can be too slow. Still, a major improvement over previous builds.  </p><p>– One-way street recognition still not addressed, so my car tries to drive on the right if there are no lines marking parallel spaces.</p><cite>Kim Paquette / YouTube.</cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>If you think about boredom at all, you might consider it trivial â€“ a part of the furniture of life, mostly an affliction of youth, and characterised by the quintessential couch potato. Nothing could be further from the truth. For a start, the couch potato is a better description of apathy than boredom. Apathy is the absence of any desire. Boredom, by contrast, involves desperately wanting to do something, yet nothing seems to fit the bill.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s also incorrect to suggest that boredom is frustration in a different guise. Frustration arises when you are thwarted in the pursuit of your goals. Boredom is the yearning for a goal to pursue in the first place. When youâ€™re bored, whatever youâ€™re doing right now is unfulfilling in some important way; you really want to be engaged, and youâ€™re urgently looking for an activity to satisfy your deep restlessness.</p>
<p>Maybe youâ€™re unfulfilled by the daily drudgery of highly repetitive work that never changes. Maybe itâ€™s the irksome task of having to do your taxes. Maybe itâ€™s trying to read an instruction manual for your dishwasher. Whatever your current situation, boredom is urging you to explore better options for becoming engaged. Itâ€™s motivating you to make a change.</p>
<p>The apocryphal story of Humphrey Potter, a version of which is told by Adam Smith in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), illustrates the point. At the tender age of 11, Potter had the unfortunate job of â€˜plug manâ€™, tending an early version of the steam engine. His task, exceedingly boring even by 1713 standards, was to open and close valves repeatedly. Watch for the right moment â€¦ open valve A â€¦ wait for the next critical moment â€¦ close valve B. He had to do this ad nauseum, day in and day out. The task rendered him, as a thinking, decision-making human being, superfluous: he was literally a cog in the machine.</p>
<p>Driven by excruciating boredom, Potter devised a system of cords and gears to make the machine do the work for him. His eureka moment not only freed him from soul-destroying work, but also advanced steam-engine technology through his invention of what has come to be known as the â€˜skulking gearâ€™. Boredom felt so bad for Potter that it motivated him to make a change.</p>
<p>Technology might have moved on, but the role of boredom in motivating change is no different for us in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Yet not all change is equal. In the 2010s, June Humphreys, a 79-year-old great-grandmother in the English town of Crewe in Cheshire, went on a five-year crime spree because she was bored of her life. Travelling around on her free bus pass, she racked up a haul worth hundreds of pounds. Clothes, sweets and alcohol made her list, but so too did some stranger items, such as a breast pump. In court, asked why she did it, Humphreys snapped: â€˜I just took them, all right? I donâ€™t get anything out of it.â€™ Darren Vernon, her hapless probation officer, defended his client feebly, noting: â€˜She knows what sheâ€™s doing is wrong â€¦ she is bored and needs to fill her time.â€™ Lonely, bereft of meaningful activity, Humphreys and her life had become pointless. Like Potter, she needed a change.</p>
<p>So, which is it? Is boredom the mother of invention or the root of larceny? On its own, boredom doesnâ€™t <em>cause</em> either. It feels uncomfortable to be bored and so motivates us to act. What happens next is up to us. And, in a nutshell, thatâ€™s boredomâ€™s ultimate message: it reminds us that what happens next is up to us. If you attend only to the discomfort of being bored, youâ€™ll miss the opportunity to use it to propel you forward in meaningful pursuits.</p>
<p>When you experience the discomfort of boredom, it is alerting you to the fact that, like Potter and Humphreys, youâ€™ve become superfluous and pointless; you need to reclaim authorship of your life. Youâ€™re having what psychologists call a crisis of agency. Youâ€™ve become passive and are currently letting life happen to you: youâ€™re not forming goals or following through on them. Youâ€™re not engaged with the world on your terms, pursuing goals that matter to you, that allow you to deploy your skills and talents in a purposeful way. Itâ€™s actually a good thing that boredom feels so uncomfortable because without it, you might fail to notice your plight.</p>
<p>The change that boredom demands is not simply about doing something different, be that inventing new technology or stealing a breast pump; rather, whatâ€™s required is a change in the way that you connect with the world. Boredom signals a need to look for activities that flow from and give expression to your curiosity, creativity and passion. In short, you need to re-establish your agency. You could create, or steal â€“ either would do the trick as far as boredom is concerned. Of course, some strategies might be judged more desirable than others. Ultimately, how you resolve boredom is up to you.</p>
<p>Boredom is not a place to linger. Youâ€™re the better for having passed through boredom because, in doing so, you stop doing whatever it was that denied you a sense of agency and, instead, start doing things that promote your agency â€“ a critical transition we all need to make in small and large ways each and every day. Itâ€™s when you get stuck and struggle to move on that boredom can become a prison, the precise opposite of a passageway to something new. This happens to some of us more often and more intensely than others.</p>
<p>â€˜Boredom pronenessâ€™ is characterised by difficulties with self-regulation and is akin to a personality trait. For those inclined to it, the story of boredom proneness is not a good one â€“ itâ€™s associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety, problems with drug and alcohol use, higher rates of problem gambling, and even problematic relations with smartphones. Itâ€™s as though the highly boredom-prone turn to these things â€“ alcohol, gambling, the rabbit hole of social media â€“ as a pacifier for boredom. Ultimately, when the pacifier is no longer there, boredom remains, relentlessly pushing them to embrace their agency. But this is precisely where the boredom-prone struggle to take their life in hand. Wherever you fall on the boredom-proneness spectrum, we hope that the advice in this Guide will be helpful by showing you productive ways to respond to the signal that boredom sends.</p>
<p>The internet abounds with lists of activities for when boredom strikes (one has 150 options!) These lists at best miss the point, and at worst hinder the very self-determination boredom demands we seek. Donâ€™t let anyone tell you what to do. There are no specific activities â€“ baking sourdough, learning a new language â€“ that will always work (for all people) to eliminate boredom and, in fact, thatâ€™s the point. The message of boredom is that <em>you</em> need to reclaim <em>your</em> agency. It has to be up to you. While we wonâ€™t be telling you specific activities to try out, there are various steps you can follow to help you reclaim your agency in the midst of boredom.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Relax</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to embrace your agency when youâ€™re restless and agitated. Overcoming that agitation is essential when youâ€™re caught in the conflict of wanting to move forward but unable to see a way around looming problems. A few deep breaths could help you feel less threatened and stuck. You could also try redirecting that restless, uncertain feeling into a physical activity, even something as simple as going for a walk. Physical exercise can allow us to feel effective, and dispense with the agitated, unused energy that we feel so intensely when weâ€™re bored. And if you find yourself trapped (imagine lengthy, boardroom meetings), even discreet fidgeting or doodling could help you stay calm and keep boredom at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Transform boredom through acceptance</strong></p>
<p>The paradox of change is that â€˜what you resist will persistâ€™. If you get caught up in feelings of disdain and rejection, you will sink only deeper into the quicksand of boredom. Instead, try to accept boredom for what it is: an uncomfortable, but helpful pointer back to a life well lived. Spending time in nature or talking with friends might help you regain perspective and let go of a hostile, oppositional attitude towards the world. Alternatively, meditation might be a useful way to cultivate a nonjudgmental attitude. Whatever strategy works for you, shifting out of an oppositional mode and acknowledging your circumstances will set the stage for you to express your agency and climb out of boredom.</p>
<p><strong>Self-reflect and choose your goals</strong></p>
<p>After calming down and acknowledging your predicament, try to focus on the possible rewards of the different things you could be doing. If you can muster up just a smidgen of enthusiasm or excitement for the possibilities, then you already have boredom on the ropes. Agency is about acting in the world based on your desires and intentions. Having something positive to aim for is helpful.</p>
<p>To get you started, you might find it beneficial to set aside time for self-reflection. Often in our day-to-day lives, weâ€™re so busy, running this way and that without consideration of what really matters to us. Boredom affords an opportunity for self-reflection, itâ€™s a chance to regroup and address some key questions about your life and yourself. Who are you? What do you care about? Having good reasons for doing something can make it less boring. After a period of reflection, even just a few moments, you can launch back into activities that matter to you, with a greater sense of why they matter. Ultimately, this promotes a greater sense of self â€“ who you are, and what you value in life.</p>
<p>A word of warning â€“ we have at our fingertips a world of passive entertainment: social media, news feeds, streaming services such as Netflix and, in Canada, Crave (thereâ€™s a hint at the problem right there in that name!) as well as addictive games such as Candy Crush Saga (which is nothing novel â€“ remember Tetris?) Itâ€™s tempting when youâ€™re in the throes of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was shocked and saddened yesterday to see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benoit_paille/">Benoit Paillé on Instagram</a> livestreaming his campervan, upside down in a snowy ditch somewhere in the boonies near New Brunswick, Canada.</p>
<p>That van was Benoit's home and his workshop. He lost both of those in the crash, along with the cameras he uses to make his living and the printer he uses to sell prints to customers.</p>
<p>Seeing that bought some things to light in my mind that I suppose I've been slow to catch on.</p>
<p>It feels ghoulish liking and commenting on Instagram posts showing someone in a deep state of loss and vulnerability, but that's what the we have to do to get past the algorithms created by Big Tech.</p>
<p>Apparently the guys (and they're all guys) running these companies are the new rockstars. But all they're doing is leading the charge in the increasing demise of the middle class. 2020 shows <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/the-great-grift">the stark contrast</a> between the haves and the have-notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remaining $2.5 trillion came via mostly forgivable loans and handouts to businesses. But don’t let the name “paycheck protection program” fool you — recipients were not required to actually protect any paychecks. The final tally is about $1 trillion in direct aid to those who truly needed it, $1 trillion to the actual pandemic response … and a $3 trillion wealth transfer to the rich and powerful. We’re calling it: The Great Grift. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation here in the UK is no different. The Tory government has handed out over £8bn in contracts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/europe/britain-covid-contracts.html">to their friends and party sponsors</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contracts that have been made public are only a part of the total. Citing the urgency of the pandemic, the government cast aside the usual transparency rules and awarded contracts worth billions of dollars without competitive bidding. To date, just over half of all of the contracts awarded in the first seven months remain concealed from the public, according to the National Audit Office, a watchdog agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And during all this, artists, like Benoit, now find themselves unable to work, in a society where, through cronyism and market manipulation millions of people find their paychecks only decreasing year after year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/how-mckinsey-destroyed-middle-class/605878/">middle class is being destroyed</a> and the result is an increasing transfer of wealth to mega-corps controlled by the ultra-wealthy. Why buy music from an artist when you can subscribe (or better yet, listen to music free) on Spotify? Why buy an original artwork when you can simply buy some mass-produced tat from Zara or H&amp;M?</p>
<p>Seeing the photos and video that Benoit posted yesterday showed me we can't carry on with the way things are. If you can spare something, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/aidez-benoit-paill-travers-sa-tragdie">help Benoit get back on his feet</a>, buy some music from an indie artist on <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.artfinder.com/#/">buy some original art</a> from an artist in your city.</p>
<p>Art is valuable and important and as a society we need to do better in enabling brilliant people to make amazing work.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Embedded in the American psyche is a requisite love for second chances—second acts, if you will. That’s why we love Silicon Valley.</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>&nbsp;Yes, trolly memes and scathing written critiques aside, we have to admit that <em>we love Silicon Valley.</em> The “scrappy startup” folklore that has emerged in the last half century is our modern version of those pixelated Oregon Trail pioneers (without the dysentery). We are glued to news of possible IPO filings, exposés of the inner workings of unicorns Way Back When, and of course, <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this"><span>Guy Raz’s telling</span></a> of how it all began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within these stories are now-humorous accounts of the original business plan. <a href="https://thehustle.co/proof-that-your-favorite-startup-started-out-awful"><span>Air mattresses in strangers’ living rooms</span></a>, a social network for podcasts, and wholesale espresso machines ultimately gave us Airbnb, Twitter, and Starbucks. But how? The answer is that each of these companies was able to pull off a second act—or, in some cases, a third or forth. In The Biz, we call that a pivot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question remains: why are we, a business that helps technology companies hire developers and designers, writing about second acts? Wouldn’t an obvious content strategy be centered around, oh, I don’t know, <em>hiring in software?</em> Marketers more seasoned than me may shudder at the missed opportunity. Hear us out.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Why we think you should throw out your first business plan</strong></h4>

<p>Sometimes, the best ideas are hidden behind the half-baked ones that we’re afraid to scrap.</p>
<p>Leaders of failed companies will often look back and note the opportunities to pivot that they missed out of fear. The reality is that even if you have a flawless business plan that has yielded a profitable company, there is a 0.00001% chance that your original idea (and even it’s closest iterations) is the one that will rocket-launch your company to mythical heights.</p>
<p>The learning that is unlocked in those first few years of success (and failure) will write the map for your second act, if you’re brave enough to follow it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’re writing about second acts because we think you should take that chance.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In technology, there are two operating tenants that should always guide our work: first, we can’t be afraid to get it wrong, and second, we must always be open to the possibility of doing it better. I don’t want to get too cerebral, but the promise of technology is the forward progress of civilization. That’s <em>a lot of pressure</em> for those of us building it. In that sense, it’s easy to cradle our ideas and iterations for fear that their alternative is failure. But to truly progress, we need to genuinely covet and embrace our own second acts. That’s not just how we win as businesses. It’s how we march forward as a society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Pause for a tearful standing ovation).&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>What to watch for this year</strong></h4>

<p>Here’s what we aim to do with this blog: we’ll tell stories of famous second acts from the perspective of a company in the middle of their own (that’s us). We’ll cut out the glittery theatrical value, the skirting of important questions, and the perfect story structure miraculously complete with a denouement that are usually characteristic of such stories, and tell them how they <em>really</em> happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll interview people who have led their companies through second acts and give you those stories in a podcast series (yes, <a href="https://www.gun.io/frontier"><span>The Frontier</span></a> will be revived after a year-long hiatus!). Most importantly, we’ll do our best to give advice to companies who find themselves on the cusp of their own second act. We’re not experts, but we’re currently in the sh*t, so we’ll candidly share what has worked (and what hasn’t) as we navigate our most recent pivot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope this candor will offer some support to those of you who want more for their companies and entrepreneurial dreams than what they currently see on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Up first: the Gun.io second (and third, and fourth) act</strong></h4>

<p>Today, we’re raising our hand to go first and telling the story of our own second act(s): the good, the bad, and the ugly. I’ve been with Gun.io since 2018 and have had a front-row seat through several of our most recent pivots, but to get the full story, I interviewed Teja Yenamandra, our founder and CEO.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Faith: Walk me through our origin story—the quick version.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Teja: How condensed do you want it? After college, I was planning to take a year off in China to travel before going to law school. Instead, I joined a consulting firm, and subsequently followed one of my bosses there to a startup whose growth strategy was to acquire small Southeast Asian companies to scale. My job was essentially assessing these companies to see if they’d be good investments, along with other strategy work. Ultimately, that company was sold, and after that experience I knew I wanted to get into tech entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>When I got back to the US, I started working with my friend JP to see if we could start a business together. With each of these potential business plans, the problem we kept running into was that we couldn’t find good programmers to build out our ideas. So, I reached out to Rich, a friend of mine who was an excellent programmer, to see if he could help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turned out that Rich had an idea of his own: to build a network to help open source developers earn a living—so that they could continue to work on open source projects, for the betterment of us all. JP and I came on to help Rich grow the company-side of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we worked together on this first iteration of Gun.io, we realized that the problem was much broader than we had originally conceived of it being. Every developer had this problem, and so did every company.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When you think of the two biggest pivots or decisions you’ve had to make over the last eight years, what are they?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In 2016, I remember sitting at Bongo Java with Tyler [our VP of Operations], and on a sheet of computer paper we wrote out basically the entire unit economics of the business. At that time, we were growing, but we were barely profitable. That’s when we decided to pivot from being a job board to more of a white-glove concierge service for companies and developers—we saw that we'd lose&nbsp; money on transactions if we continued down the path of being a job board, even if we only spent $10 per new customer. I think that’s a lesson from most of our pivots, actually: they are the culmination of a tremendous amount of intuition, and punctuated by fast decisions, not a lot of analytical work.</p>
<p>Second is moving from a concierge approach to a platform approach. This happened just in the last two years, when we realized that we could impact more people if we had more scale and automation than just hiring more personnel could provide. There was a lot of hesitation with platform-izing the business, but to grow, you have to be willing to change who you are.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Walk me through our most recent pivot—from an entirely services-based company to a product-based one. How did you think about technology investment? How did you determine how much investment would be appropriate, and what would likely pay off?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The thing about being a services business is that you can pretty easily model out what growth could look like: your material costs, how those can generate revenue, and so on. There’s a lot of confidence in that kind of math. There’s just not that kind of confidence around investment in technology, because there’s no guarantee that what you’re building will ever even cover the costs of building it. So much of the work that your engineering team does is contingent on the successful work of sales and marketing to sell the thing that you built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What precipitated the need for product investment, for us, was that we invested heavily in personnel, and growth flatlined. The alternative was investing heavily in technology, which is riskier, but has the potential for exponentially more payoff down the line. Tech investment yields nonlinear returns, which can be both good and bad.</p>
<p>We were in a place where we were trying to induce growth by changing words on a sales call. We had to take a step back and admit that strategy was never going to yield the kind of growth we wanted. Advice: if you find yourself in that position, you f***ed up a long time ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, part of determining your initial investment in technology is instinct and personal risk tolerance. I asked myself, how much am I willing to risk on unproven results, to pay off later? I looked at everything we could possibly invest in and thought, a year from now, which has the most potential to have a positive outcome on everyone at the company?</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest compromise we made with our most recent Second Act?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely the ability to have a personal relationship with everyone who we work with—specifically, developers and clients. We’re able to positively impact a lot more people, but I used to know everyone who worked on the platform, and I think that was meaningful.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on navigating a pivot or Second Act as a bootstrapped company like us, versus a venture-backed one?</strong></p>
<p>Man, being bootstrapped affords us so much flexibility. I love it. The bad part about staying bootstrapped is that I think I do my best work with lots of pressure on me, which doesn’t happen when you don’t have a board of investors holding you accountable. I hack that by considering myself an employee of everyone who works for the company. I hold myself accountable to them, and take that really seriously. If you’re a bootstrapped and profitable company, you have an infinite runway to try new things and pursue all of the second acts that you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is your advice to other companies in our shoes, whose second act will be their first foray into building technology and leading engineering teams?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First, for business leaders, I’d say stay close to the product from the beginning. It’s important that the people who are doing the selling conversations are staying really close to the product and have a voice in the roadmap. As a services business, you’re …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>

</div>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0`, ping root's veth0
$ ping -c 2 172.18.0.11

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000

# Remember this 10.0.2.15

$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0

# Try host's eth0
$ ping 10.0.2.15
connect: Network is unreachable

# Try something from the Internet
$ ping 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable</code></pre>
<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:
$ ip route
172.18.0.0/16 dev ceth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.10</code></pre>
<p>Linux has a bunch of ways to populate the routing table. …</p></div></div>

When you go to Gmail, you will notice the URL looks like this <code>https://mail.google.com/mail/u/N/...</code> where N is the index of the account starting from 0. This allows the Frontend app to identify which account it should get data for from the server or <code>localStorage</code> and gives you the ability view different accounts in different tabs, where refreshing does not affect which account/page you are viewing.</p><p>Looking at Gmail's cookies, you will notice that the keys <code>GMAIL_AT</code> and <code>COMPASS</code> have their <code>Path</code> values correspond to <code>/mail/u/N</code> and I believe this is where each account's token is stored.</p><p>Twitter's approach is a bit different, you cannot use different accounts in different tabs, once you switch to a different account in one tab, the other tab switches the account right away, I believe they use the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel">BroadcastChannel Web API</a> to detect the switch, and then refresh the whole page. As for Instagram, I could not test their multi-login mechanism, but I would think it behaves in a similar way to Twitter. </p><h2>Objective</h2><p>My goal is to imitate Google's approach with some twists:</p><ul><li>Login to multiple accounts</li><li>The ability to use them independently in different tabs.</li><li>Refreshing a tab should not log you out or switch you to another account.</li><li>Logout from each account should not force you to log out from all, which is the case for Google's implementation.</li><li>Avoid Google's routing style. So, no <code>/mail/u/N</code>.</li></ul><h3>Tracking logins and workarounds:</h3><p>As mentioned, Google forces you to logout of all accounts and that is due to the use of indexes they assign for each account, you cannot logout of account 3 (index 2) and still use account 4 (index 3). If we follow Google's approach, we would be giving up on the ability to logout from accounts independently. Unless we use random digits instead of in-order indexes.</p><p>We could also use query parameters instead to detect which account we are currently using, but we would still face the same logout issue, unless we use random digits instead of indexes. <code>?account=536</code></p><p>My preferred solution is to use a mix of <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> to keep track of the user in each tab. <code>localStorage</code> keeps track of all the accounts that are logged in, while <code>sessionStorage</code> can store which of these accounts we are using in the current session. This should allow using different account in different tabs, refreshing does not remove your session, but closing the tab does.</p><p>So, what happens if we visit a link in a fresh tab IF we are already logged into multiple accounts? Well, we can show the user a list of accounts, they can choose which to use. And this is a pro and a con:</p><ul><li>The con is that the user's navigation must interrupt, but luckily it only happens if the user is logged into multiple accounts.</li><li>The pro is fixing the issue in Google's implementation where sharing links with others is wacky... let me explain: Jane and I work at a company that uses Google Suite, she uses the work account as her default (index 0), and I use my personal Gmail account as my default, and the work account as index 1. Jane shares a link with index 0, Google will not let me see the content, and I must switch manually.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>This POC is done using Angular. To view the completed solution head over to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bilal-io/Multi-Login-POC">https://github.com/Bilal-io/Multi-Login-POC</a>.</p><p>Let's walk through some files to explain what is going on:</p><ul><li>Anything under <code>interceptors</code> is borrowed from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cornflourblue">https://github.com/cornflourblue</a> and it is acting as a fake backend. We call <code>./users/authenticate</code> route to login and we get a response.</li><li>The auth service <code>services/auth.service.ts</code> has helper functions to login, logout, switch accounts, and deal with <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, as well as store our login state. Too much in one file, it could be refactored.</li><li>There are two lazy loaded modules, dashboard and admin.</li><li>If we look at <code>guards/authentication.guard.ts</code> and <code>guards/admin.guard.ts</code> we find two auth guards for the dashboard and admin modules. Each has a <code>canLoad</code> interface that prevent downloading its respective module if we are not authenticated, or authenticated but not an admin. There is also a  <code>canActivate</code> interface that prevents the route from being accessed if not authenticated. (in can the module was loaded, then the user logs out)</li><li>The Header component lists the users in a dropdown menu, allows us to logout of the active user, or switch to another.</li><li>The Login page checks the app state to see if we have any accounts, and displays them, giving us the option to choose which to use. Or we can switch to the form and enter the credentials of a different account. In either case, we get redirected to the <code>/dashboard</code> unless the tab was initially to a specific URL i.e. <code>./dashboard/test</code> then we store that in a query param <code>?redirect=</code> and redirect the user to it after a successful login or account switch.</li></ul></div><div><p>Sorry no comments system yet, use the links below for questions and comments</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <div data-article-id="126" id="article-body">
            <p>Why am I writing this today, of all days? No real reason. It just struck me this morning to share the thought.</p>

<p>We now have an ALL TIME RECORD number (probably 100+) of COSS startups that have raised $5M+ (many have raised $10M+) in VC funding where the following two things are simultaneously True:</p>

<p>1) The COSS company has some early signs of open source momentum/traction as evidenced by GitHub Stars or project Downloads (by the way, both metrics are, on their own, deeply flawed as primary proxies for "company investable" heuristics).</p>

<p>2) The COSS company has no product IP nor clear product plans. Also, goes without saying, the company is "pre-revenue".</p>

<p>Most of these financings have NOT been publicly announced and no single firm has access to all the data (except maybe OSS Capital). In reality, my sense is that 2 out of 5 seed/pre-seed deals never get announced and perhaps the same is true for 1 out of 5 Series A deals. I'm being conservative.</p>

<p>This is a shocking new reality driven primarily by the meteoric rise of great COSS companies like HashiCorp, Elastic, MongoDB, GitHub, MuleSoft, Starburst, Confluent, GitLab and many others over the last 5 ~ years.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to find and seed invest in the next HashiCorp. If you miss that, funding the Series A is also a great idea, no?</p>

<p>Quite simply, over the last 2 ~ years, something on the order of 100+ pre-revenue and pre-product COSS companies have been seriously well funded with nothing more than a deck and a promising open source project. I cannot share this data publicly, but just know that it is accurate and that we have this data.</p>

<p>Basically every VC across all fund sizes under the sun who invests in "tech" (which is vastly digital, which is vastly software, which is vastly open source these days) is now a COSS startup investor.</p>

<p>Is this entirely bad? No. Is this entirely good? Also no. Let me explain...</p>

<p>Why is this "Bad":</p>

<p>-Founders who partner with VCs that do NOT understand the fundamentals of open source are going to be misled, distracted with having to educate their investors from scratch about very nuanced and complex things and their relationships will be extremely far from idealistic. Very few VCs (it is important to focus on the partner/individual at a given firm, not the firm itself.. given that literally only one firm on earth focuses on COSS exclusively) have a deep understanding of open source, let alone COSS, and many/most have zero-to-no track record of actually helping COSS companies successfully navigate their journeys from pre-revenue to PMF and beyond.</p>

<p>-Founders who raise meaningful capital from VC well before even possessing a basic understanding market dynamics will be forced to have full clarity on those issues in short order, and if they are not able to graduate and grow into investor expectations within 1-2 years at most, they will experience very painful misalignment conversations... which will cause them to betray social contracts and principles set in place with other key stakeholders in their open source ecosystems.</p>

<p>Why is this "Good":</p>

<p>-More COSS companies are getting funding than ever, enabling FOSS creators to transform into founders of well funded startups.</p>

<p>-Early-stage COSS companies can take this funding and invest it purely/largely in the growth of their FOSS communities, creating new abundance for the world in a positive-sum way.</p>

<p>-The VC world is learning faster than ever about the fundamental benefits of open source at the core of capitalism and business. This is a huge net positive.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thrilled to see so much COSS funding and we inclusively cover all of it here on COSS Community via COSS Weekly and our data resources. </p>

<p>However, in these times of high capital abundance in the private startup/company equity investing markets, founders should be more careful than ever about deciding who they partner with... this is VASTLY more critical than naively optimizing for "max price for min dilution".</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/">reproducibility is an important aspect of any scientific endeavor</a>.  With Machine Learning being a scientific discipline, as well as an engineering one, reproducibility is equally important here.</p>

<p>There is widespread fear in the ML community that we are living through a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis">reproducibility crisis</a>. Efforts like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">Papers with Code Reproducibility Challenge</a>, signaled a clear call-to-action for practitioners, after a 2016 Nature survey revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">70% of results are non-reproducible</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of the talk amongst the community has centered on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300933">reproducing machine learning results in research</a>, there has been less focus on the production side of things. Therefore, today letâ€™s focus more on the topic of reproducible ML in production and create a larger conversation around it.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-reproducibility-important">Why is reproducibility important?</h2>

<p>
  â€œIf you canâ€™t repeat it, you canâ€™t trust itâ€� - All Ops Teams
</p>

<p>A good question to start with is why exactly reproducibility is important, for machine learning in particular. Here are list of benefits one gains by ensuring reproducibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases <strong>trust</strong></li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>explainability</strong> of ML results</li>
  <li>Increases <strong>reliability</strong></li>
  <li>Fulfills <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>, and <strong>regulatory</strong> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Concretely, ML models tend to go through a lifecycle of being destroyed, forged anew and re-created as <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/technical_debt/">development evolves from rudimentary notebook snippets to a testable, productionized codebase</a>. Therefore, we better make sure that every time a model is (re-) trained, the results are what we expect them to be.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-big-deal">Whatâ€™s the big deal?</h2>
<p>One would think that reproducibility in production ML should be easy. After all, most machine learning is scripting. How hard can it be to simply execute a bunch of scripts again at a later stage and come to the exact same result, right?</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong></p>

<p>Reproducibility of machine learning is hard because it spans many different disciplines, from understanding non-deterministic algorithmic behaviors, to software engineering best practices. Leaving aside the fact that most machine learning code quality tends to err towards the low side (due to the experimental nature of the work), there is an inherent complexity to ML which makes things even harder.</p>

<p>E.g. Just training a model on the same data with the same configuration does not mean the same model is produced. Perhaps one could achieve a similar <em>overall</em> accuracy (or whatever other metric), but even a slight change in parameters might skew metrics for slices of your data - leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">sometimes very unpleasant results</a></p>

<p>So, how can we ensure that stuff like does not happen? In my opinion, one can break down reproducibility in the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code</li>
  <li>The configuration</li>
  <li>The environment</li>
  <li>The data</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Checking code into a version control system like Git ensures a clean trace of how code evolves, and the ability to rollback to any point in history. However, Git alone is not a fix for reproducibility, but only for one aspect of it.</p>

<p>In reality, reproducibility in production is solved by version control, testing of code as well as integrations, and idempotent deployment automation. This is hard to apply in practice. E.g. The main tool for ML is Jupyter notebooks, which are notoriously difficult to check into version control. Even worse, most notebook code is not sequential in its execution, and can have an arbitrary, impossible to reproduce, sequence of execution.</p>

<p>But even if ML practitioners follow a pattern of refactoring their code into separate modules, simply checking modules into source control is still not enough to ensure reproducibility. One needs to link the commit history to model training runs and models. This can be achieved e.g. by enforcing a standard in your team that pins a git sha to experiment runs. That way there is a global unique ID that ties the code and configuration (see below) to the results it produced.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Software Engineering preaches separation of application code and application configuration to allow for predictable and deterministic software behavior across environments. This actually translates well in a machine learning code: E.g. one can separate the model definition and training loop code, from the associated hyper-parameters which define the configuration.</p>

<p>The first step to unlock reproducibility is to actually separate configuration from code in the first place. For me this means, the code itself should NOT define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Split parameters (e.g. 80-20 split)</li>
  <li>Preprocessing parameters (e.g. the fact that data was normalized)</li>
  <li>Training hyper-parameters (including pre-processing parameters)</li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria, .e.g, metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally all these are tracked separately in a <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/declarative_configs_for_mlops/">declarative config</a> that is human readable.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>If a ML result is produced on a dev local machine, there is a high chance it is not going to be reproducible. Why? Because developers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, are not super diligent in creating and maintaining proper virtual environments.</p>

<p>The obvious solution for this one is containerizing applications, with lets say, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>. However, here is another example of when skills of ML practitioners begin diverging from conventional software engineers. Most data scientists are not trained in these matters, and require proper organizational support to help and encourage them to produce containerized applications.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>And finally, we arrive at the data. Data versioning has become one of the most discussed topics in the production machine learning community. Unlike code, you canâ€™t simply check data into version control easily (although tools like <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> are attempting just that).</p>

<p>In the same way as code, achieving basic versioning of data does not necessarily ensure reproducibility. There is a whole bunch of metadata associated with how data is utilized in machine learning development, all of which is necessary to persist to ensure trainings are reproducible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple, but common, example that illustrates this point. If you have ever worked with machine learning, have you ever created a folder/storage bucket somewhere that has random files in varying preprocessing states? Something like, <code>normalized_1.json</code> or perhaps even timestamped <code>12_02_19.csv</code>? Technically, a timestamped file is versioned data, but that does not mean associated runs with it are reproducible: One would have to know how, when and where (i.e. the aforementioned metadata) these versioned files are used to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h3>
<p>While it may fall outside the scope of this blog, the open-source MLOps framework ZenML showcases a clear example 
of putting these principles in action <a href="https://docs.zenml.io/benefits/ensuring-ml-reproducibility.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility in machine learning is not trivial, and ensuring it in production is even harder. ML teams need to be fully aware of the precise aspects to track in their processes to unlock reproducibility.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for a head start to enable reproducibility: check out <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenML</a>, an open-source MLOps framework for reproducible machine learning - and leave a star while youâ€™re there.</p>

<p>Also, hop on over to our <a href="https://zenml.io/slack-invite">Slack Channel</a> if you want to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be back in a few days to talk about using Git in a machine learning setting - stay tuned!</p>

<![CDATA[Building an NLP Engine Is Hard, but Not as Hard as Defining Terms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In my full-time role at <a aria-label="Nuvi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nuvi.com/blog/strategic-decision-making-nuvis-all-new-language-engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nuvi</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where we’re able to push the boundaries in the natural language processing field. We built out several different “facets” that we score text on, including sentiment, emotion, vulgarity, tense, and currently, we’re working on promotion detection.</p>
<p>While the technical side of NLP is hard, one of the hardest things was unexpected – defining the boundaries between the categories in question. Which words count as vulgar? Does anticipation entail positive emotions? Can a single tweet exude anger and fear at the same time despite being opposites according to Plutchik? In this article, we’ll explore some of these questions and how we ended up answering them.</p>
<h2>Emotion Facets</h2>
<p>The eight emotions we set out to build a classification engine for are defined by <a aria-label="Plutchik's wheel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.6seconds.org/2020/08/11/plutchik-wheel-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plutchik’s wheel</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Joy</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Trust</li><li>Disgust</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Surprise</li></ul>
<p>Our emotion detection is based on a probabilistic algorithm that requires training and test data from human-annotations. In order to get a high-quality dataset, we found early on that simply telling our annotators to categorize sentences as to whether or not the author was expressing “anticipation” wasn’t <em>nearly</em> enough instruction. Once we got down to the brass tacks of some specific examples, we found that <em>we didn’t even agree internally</em> on classifications in many instances.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the examples we had trouble with as a team and go over the conclusions we came to. If you have thoughts be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">tweet at me</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of anticipation according to <a aria-label="Oxford (opens in a new tab)" href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oxford</a> is “The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.” In other words, we’re looking for when someone is showing forethought, making a prediction, etc. Here are some examples we agreed on quickly as expressing “anticipation”:</p>
<ul><li>“I can’t wait to go to the movie theater again!”</li><li>“I’m so excited for sports to come back, can’t happen soon enough!”</li><li>“Tesla stock is way too high, it’s going to tank soon.”</li></ul>
<p>The first one we had trouble with was:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m so nervous to go back to the office. Working from home has been great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us had the idea that “anticipation” carried a connotation of “being excited”. In other words, you can’t really anticipate something if you <em>don’t want</em> it to happen. We eventually decided that this isn’t a useful definition for several reasons. First, we already do sentiment classification separately, so baking positive sentiment into the anticipation facet isn’t super helpful. Second, the opposite of anticipation in our emotion wheel is “surprise”. We all agreed that surprises can be good or bad. It stands to reason the surpise’s opposite, anticipation, should behave the same way.</p>
<p>The next problematic example arose a few days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if I’m going to win</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates made the point that this sentence expresses apprehension, which can be considered a form of anticipation. I played devil’s advocate saying that “I don’t know” is the polar opposite of a prediction, how can that be anticipation?</p>
<p>In the end, we found that we had to provide paragraph-long explanations of each category to our annotators, complete with examples of what is and isn’t counted as a part of the category in question.</p>
<h2>Vulgarity Detection</h2>
<p>NSFW Disclaimer: <em>I’m going to talk about our vulgarity detection, and will need to say some naughty words. If you find that offensive turn back now!</em></p>
<p>The way the current iteration of our vulgarity engine works is to take a piece of text as input, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well hot damn those potatos hit the spot!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And output a fractional score from 0-1 representing how likely the text is to contain vulgar text. For the above sample, it might be something like <code>.75</code> Which brings us to our first problem, <strong>what do <em>we</em> consider to be vulgar?</strong></p>
<p>According to one of my teammates “damn”, “shit” and “hell” aren’t bad words. However, while <em>he may not</em> consider them to be, <em><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many people do</a></em>. We’re left in the interesting position of trying to rank all the vulgar words. Here are some of the biggest issues we ran into with vulgarity:</p>
<h3>Not all bad words are created equally</h3>
<p>Most people would loosely agree with the following ranking from most vulgar -&gt; to least vulgar :</p>
<ul><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<h3>Religious / Culture Specific</h3>
<p>However, problems arise when people of different religious beliefs examine the list. A Christian person may consider the following list accurate:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Jesus Christ!</li><li>Oh my God!</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>Whereas the atheist/agnostic/pagan may not consider “Jesus Christ!” or “Oh my God!” to deserve to be on the list at all.</p>
<h3>Geographically Specific</h3>
<p>If you’re from England proper, you may also expect a few additional words:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Wanker</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Bloody</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>In the end, we ended up mixing the concept of probability and intensity for the sake of simplicity and we’ve found that our clients are happy with the result. For example, the presence of an intensely “bad” word that’s recognized by basically everyone as vulgar will have a higher weight in the probability calculation than one which is weaker or not accepted by everyone as “bad”.</p>
<p><code>vulgarity_weight = intensity * acceptance</code></p>
<p>Once we started looking at everything as a fluid spectrum it became much easier to agree amongst ourselves what constitutes “vulgarity”. My coworker who claimed “shit”, “damn”, and “hell” aren’t vulgar easily admitted that they’re <em>more vulgar</em> than trivial interjections like “crap”, “dang”, or “heck”.</p>
<h2>Promotion and Solicitation Detection</h2>
<p>The project we’re working on currently has also turned out to be a vague and difficult one to pin down. The goal is to classify text as to whether it’s promotional or not, but we’ve had a hard time defining what we want. For example, we all agreed quickly that the following we classify as :promotional”:</p>
<ul><li>“We are doing a sweet promo this week! Sign up for 20% off”</li><li>“Our new product just launched, be sure to check it out”</li><li>“GORGEOUS 😍 previously owned Gucci backpack for $1700😍😍 ⭐️WE SHIP ⭐️ Call the store to purchase 555-555-5555 📲”</li></ul>
<p>The following however posed an interesting problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want a $42&nbsp;@gucci lipstick yes I do…. can I afford it right now No I cant&nbsp; but it’s soooo good!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s obviously promoting Gucci, it isn’t actually soliciting direct action from the reader. There’s no call to action. Is this a requirement of a solicitation as scored by Nuvi? We’re not sure yet – but we’re figuring that out.</p>

<![CDATA[Amazon: Not OK – Why we had to change Elastic licensing]]>

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.
</p><p>Thank you. It is a privilege to be on this journey with you.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a previous post <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring mmap using Go</a>, we talked about how databases have a major problem to solve, which is: <strong>how to deal with data stored in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. We talked about how many databases solve this problem using <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> and explored <strong>mmap</strong> capabilities.</p><p>Knowing that databases use <strong>memory-mapped files </strong>to solve the problem was not enough for me. It solved part of the mystery but a question remained: <strong>how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em> to read and write data from disk?</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I decided to dig through a database source code to answer that question. There are plenty of databases that use mmap. Some of them decided to not use anymore. Some examples: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> has an option of accessing disk content directly using memory-mapped I/O<sup>[1]</sup>, it seems <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> used to use but it changed it<sup>[2]</sup>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> has an option with <em>MMapDirectory</em><sup>[3]</sup>, <a href="https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/">LMDB</a> uses mmap<sup>[4]</sup>, a simple key/value in-memory database from Counchbase called <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/moss">moss</a> uses mmap for durability of in-memory data<sup>[5]</sup> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> removed <strong>mmap</strong> storage engine for <em>WiredTiger</em><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">bolt</a>, a simple <strong>key/value store</strong> implemented in <strong>Go</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> inspired by the <strong>LMDB</strong> project, for this endeavor. Mostly because of source code simplicity and my familiarity with Go language. I know a simple key/value store might not be the most complete source code for learning all the details of reading/writing data to disk, but as I have found out, it was more than enough to get a grasp of it. </p><p>The original bolt repository is no longer maintained. A fork of <strong>bolt</strong> called <strong>bbolt</strong> is maintained and used by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">etcd</a>. If you are not familiar with <strong>bolt</strong>, I recommend the articles <a href="https://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/">Intro to BoltDB: Painless Performant Persistence</a> and <a href="https://www.progville.com/go/bolt-embedded-db-golang/">Bolt — an embedded key/value database for Go </a>.</p><h2 id="the-start">The start</h2><p>I download the code to my machine and opened it in my editor. I thought a good place to start digging was to find out where the database was initialized and look for any references of <strong>mmap</strong> there. Like most embedded databases, <strong>bolt </strong>has an <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L150">Open</a> method for opening the database or creating a new one if it does not exist. Inside it, I found a reference to a private <strong>mmap</strong> function. That's a good start. </p><pre><code>// Memory map the data file.
if err := db.mmap(options.InitialMmapSize); err != nil {
    _ = db.close()
    return nil, err
}</code></pre><h2 id="how-much-memory-should-i-allocate">How much memory should I allocate?</h2><p>The private <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20(db%20*DB)%20mmap(minsz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a> is responsible for opening the memory-mapped file. In order to do this, it needs to figure out how much memory it is going to allocate. This task is accomplished by another method called <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a>. Given the size of the database, this method figures out how many bytes of memory should be allocated.</p><p>It starts by doubling the size from <strong>32KB</strong> to <strong>1GB</strong>. But if the database is larger than <strong>1GB</strong>, it grows <strong>1GB</strong> at a time.</p><pre><code>// Double the size from 32KB until 1GB.
for i := uint(15); i &lt;= 30; i++ {
	if size &lt;= 1&lt;&lt;i {
		return 1 &lt;&lt; i, nil
	}
}

...

// If larger than 1GB then grow by 1GB at a time.
sz := int64(size)
if remainder := sz % int64(maxMmapStep); remainder &gt; 0 {
	sz += int64(maxMmapStep) - remainder
}</code></pre><p>It is all fine by now. That's how <strong>bolt</strong> figured out how much to allocate. But there is a piece of the puzzle now that will be very important when we talk about database storage layout. After figuring out how much to allocate, it needs to ensure that the allocated size is a multiple of the <strong>page size</strong>. If you are not familiar with database storage and don't know what a <strong>page</strong> is, don't worry, we'll be back to this.</p><pre><code>// Ensure that the mmap size is a multiple of the page size.
// This should always be true since we're incrementing in MBs.
pageSize := int64(db.pageSize)
if (sz % pageSize) != 0 {
	sz = ((sz / pageSize) + 1) * pageSize
}</code></pre><p>Shouldn't it check if we are allocating more than we have available? That's the last piece of the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a> method.</p><pre><code>// If we've exceeded the max size then only grow up to the max size.
if sz &gt; maxMapSize {
	sz = maxMapSize
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bolt_amd64.go#L4">maxMapSize</a> constant is set to <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFF</code> on <strong>AMD64</strong> architectures.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote>The <strong>AMD64</strong> architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TiB (2<sup>48</sup> bytes) of virtual address space. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64 Wiki</a></blockquote><p>This is the limit of the <strong>bolt</strong> database file.</p><h2 id="calling-the-system-call">Calling the system call</h2><p>Now that <strong>bolt</strong> knows how much it should allocate, it calls the system call <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20mmap(db%20*DB,%20sz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a>. Here is the full code for <em>Unix</em>-like environments:</p><pre><code>// mmap memory maps a DB's data file.
func mmap(db *DB, sz int) error {
	// Map the data file to memory.
	b, err := syscall.Mmap(int(db.file.Fd()), 0, sz, syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED|db.MmapFlags)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Advise the kernel that the mmap is accessed randomly.
	if err := madvise(b, syscall.MADV_RANDOM); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("madvise: %s", err)
	}

	// Save the original byte slice and convert to a byte array pointer.
	db.dataref = b
	db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
	db.datasz = sz
	return nil
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It is a pretty straightforward code. I have some observations to make about <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code>, but I'll leave for the next session. It is nice to see the call to madvise there, although I don't know its benefits. I would love to know the importance of that call, if it improves performance or if another flag could be set to get different behavior from OS for different use cases.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The mapped memory is set to the variables <code>db.dataref</code> and <code>db.data</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>db.dataref = b
db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I would like to know about the importance of keeping track of both variables. I could not grasp what is going on in the conversion to <code>db.data</code>. But anyway, what we have to keep in mind is that is through these variables that <strong>bolt</strong> will read data from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-about-writes">What about writes?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While skimming through the source code, I looked for evidence of how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for both reads and writes. I dug both <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L266">Get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L285">Put</a> method. I could not find any place where the references to <code>db.dataref</code> or <code>db.data</code> were being updated. I discovered that the writes to disk happen when <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/tx.go#L144">Commit</a> is called to a transaction. But there I could only find calls to <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.WriteAt">WriteAt</a>. So I gave up my search of trying to understand how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then, suddenly, while looking back to the call of <strong>mmap</strong>, I noticed the  <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code> flag that I have not noticed the first time I looked at the code. So <strong>mmap</strong>, is only used for reads in <strong>bolt</strong>. Another place that indicates this is in the definition of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L100">DB struct</a>:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>dataref  []byte   // mmap'ed readonly, write throws SEGV
data     *[maxMapSize]byte</code></pre><p>That made perfect sense to me. Since flushes to disk are very hard to control when using <strong>mmap</strong>, it is probably the safest approach. How <strong>bolt</strong> does writing is a topic of another post. </p><h2 id="how-the-database-file-is-structured">How the database file is structured?</h2><p>We know how and when<strong> bolt </strong>allocates memory and that <strong>mmap</strong> is not used for writes. But how, exactly, <strong>bolt</strong> can find the value of a key? To understand that, we have to understand how typically databases structure their files. I am not going to do deep here. Mostly because I don't understand enough to go deep. Just going to try to give a glimpse of what is going on. </p><p>A file is just an array of bytes. We have to apply some reasoning to this array of bytes to work with it effectively. Databases structure their files in disk into blocks (chunks of bytes) called <strong>pages</strong>. <strong>bolt </strong>is no different. The database file can be seen as</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--17-.png" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Each page has a <strong>fixed length of bytes</strong>, typically the same size as the OS page (usually <code>4096 bytes</code>).

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>My interest in <em>Assembly</em> language started when I was a kid, mainly because of computer viruses of the <code>DOS</code> era. I’ve spent countless hours contemplating my first humble collection of source codes and samples (you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/virii">https://github.com/guitmz/virii</a>) and to me, it’s cool how flexible and creative one can get with <em>Assembly</em>, even if its learning curve is steep.</p>

<p>I’m an independant malware researcher and wrote this virus to learn and have fun, expanding my knowledge on the several <em>ELF</em> attack/defense techniques and <em>Assembly</em> in general.</p>

<p>The code does not implement any evasion techniques and detection is trivial. Samples were also shared with a few major Antivirus companies prior to the release of this code and signatures were created, such as <code>Linux/Midrashim.A</code> by <a href="https://www.eset.com/">ESET</a>. I’m also working on a <em>vaccine</em> which will be available at a later date. I’ll update this post when it’s ready.</p>

<p>The payload is not destructive, as usual. It just prints the harmless lyrics of <a href="https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Ozar_Midrashim">Ozar Midrashim</a> song to <code>stdout</code> and the layout of an infected file is the following (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png">full image</a>):</p>

<p>
<img data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png" data-srcset="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png 1500w" src="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png" srcset="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png 1500w">
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p><code>Midrashim</code> is a <em>64 bits</em> Linux infector that targets ELF files in the current directory (non recursively). It relies on the well known <code>PT_NOTE -&gt; PT_LOAD</code> infection technique and should work on regular and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793">position independent</a> binaries. This method has a high success rate and it’s easy to implement (and detect). Read more about it <a href="https://www.symbolcrash.com/2019/03/27/pt_note-to-pt_load-injection-in-elf/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will not work on <code>Golang</code> executables, because those need the <code>PT_NOTE</code> segment to run properly (infection works, but infected file will segfault after virus execution).</p>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, it makes use of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pread64">pread64</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite64">pwrite64</a> to read/write specific locations in the target file when it should use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> instead, for flexibility and reliability. A few other things could be improved too, like detecting first virus execution with a better approach and more error handling to minimize pitfalls.</p>

<p>I had so many ideas for the payload of Midrashim, from inspiration I got from projects at <a href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net/</a> to controlling the terminal with ANSI escape codes (more on that <a href="https://www.guitmz.com/having-fun-with-ansi-codes-and-x64-linux-assembly/">here</a> - which is something I wrote with Midrashim in mind).</p>

<p>Due to lack of free time and given the complexity of implementing such things in Assembly, specially in a code of this nature, I ended up with something simpler and will probably revisit this subject on a future project.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>This is my first full assembly infector and should be assembled with <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> x64. Its core functionality consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserving space on stack to store values in memory</li>
<li>Checking if its virus first run (displays a different payload message if running for the first time)</li>
<li>Open current directory for reading</li>
<li>Loop through files in the directory, checking for targets for infection</li>
<li>Try to infect target file</li>
<li>Continue looping the directory until no more infection targets are available, then exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Full code with comments is available at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim">https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim</a> and we’ll now go over each step above with a bit more detail.</p>

<h3 id="the-secret-of-getting-ahead-is-getting-started">The secret of getting ahead is getting started</h3>

<p>For the stack buffer, I used <code>r15</code> register and added the comments below for reference when browsing the code.</p>

<p>Note the values, for example, the ELF header, which is <em>64 bytes</em> long. Since <code>r15 + 144</code> represents its start, it should end at <code>r15 + 207</code>. The values in between are also accounted for, like <code>ehdr.entry</code> that starts at <code>r15 + 168</code>, which is <em>8 bytes</em> long, ends at <code>r15 + 175</code>.</p>

<p>Reserving stack space is easy, there are different ways of doing it, one is to subtract from <code>rsp</code>, then just store it in <code>r15</code>. Also right on start, we store <code>argv0</code> to <code>r14</code> (it’s going to be needed next) and we push <code>rdx</code> and <code>rsp</code>, which need to be restored before the end of virus execution, so the infected file can run properly.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>v_start:</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r14</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span> <span>+</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span>  <span>; saving argv0 to r14</span>

    <span>mov</span> <span>r15</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>        <span>; r15 has the reserved stack buffer address</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To check for the virus first execution, we get <code>argv0</code> size in bytes and compare to the final virus size, which was stored in <code>V_SIZE</code>. If greater, it’s not the first run and we set a control value into a place in the stack buffer for later use. This was a last minute addition that it’s not great (but pretty easy to implement and rather obvious).</p>

					<div><h3><span>Vulnerabilities threaten DNS integrity (again)</span></h3>
<p>The JSOF research labs are reporting 7 vulnerabilities found in <em>dnsmasq</em>, an open-source DNS forwarding software in common use. Dnsmasq is very popular, and we have identified approximately 40 vendors whom we believe use dnsmasq in their products, as well as major Linux distributions.</p>
<p><br>The DNS protocol has a history of vulnerabilities dating back to the famous 2008 Kaminsky attack. Nevertheless, a large part of the Internet still relies on DNS as a source of integrity, in the same way it has for over a decade, and is therefore exposed to attacks that can endanger the integrity of parts of the web.</p>
<h3><span>DNSpooq</span></h3>
<p><span>The Dnspooq vulnerabilities include DNS cache poisoning vulnerabilities as well as a potential Remote code execution and others.&nbsp;</span><span>The list of devices using dnsmasq is long and varied.&nbsp;</span><span>According to our internet-based research, prominent users of dnsmasq seem to include Cisco routers, Android phones, Aruba devices, Technicolor, and Red-Hat, as well as Siemens, Ubiquiti networks, Comcast, and others listed below.&nbsp;</span><span>Depending on how they use dnsmasq, devices may be more or less affected, or not affected at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The origin of the name DNSpooq is a merge of 3 elements: DNS spoofing, the idea of a spook spying on Internet traffic, and the ‘q’ at the end of dnsmasq, replacing the ‘k’ of spook with a ‘q’. The spy or spook graphic illustrates the effects of an effective DNS spoofing on the ability to spy on internet traffic. The JSOF-pink glasses show how looking through tainted glasses, or a compromised middleman may alter your perception of the reality.</span></p>
<p><span>DNSpooq demonstrates that DNS implementations are still insecure, even today, 13 years after the last major attack was described.</span></p>
<p>Given the vulnerabilities in DNS over the years, you would think that the security-enhancement mechanisms that have been developed in response,&nbsp; would be ubiquitous by now. However, in reality, DNSSEC is still not very widely deployed, and neither is HSTS. For example, according to research from 2017, adoption of HSTS among the 1M most popular websites <span><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Petrov%2C%20Ivan_1801.pdf">was only at about 5%</a></span>). According to some rough estimates performed by JSOF with the help of large Internet companies, and matching external sources, around <span><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/keeping-up-with-performance-demands-of-encrypted-web-traffic">15-20% of Internet traffic</a></span> is still completely unencrypted, and users still click through to insecure websites.</p>

<h3><span>History</span></h3>
<p>In 2008, well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed a fundamental flaw in the Internet naming scheme that affected the most common DNS software and the integrity of the way the Internet worked at the time.</p>
<p>Kaminsky proved that attackers can impersonate any website name and steal data. (This has since become known as the “Kaminsky Attack”).</p>
<p>DNS has been considered a somewhat insecure protocol for decades, ever since the Kaminsky disclosure and even before that, though it is assumed to guarantee a certain level of integrity. This is the reason it is still heavily relied upon. At the same time, mechanisms have been developed to improve the security of the original DNS protocol. These mechanisms include HTTPS, HSTS, DNSSEC, and other initiatives. Browsers also try to increase users awareness by alerting them before accessing insecure sites with messages such as <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/your-connection-is-not-private/"><span>“Your Connection is Not Private”</span></a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with all these mechanisms in place, a DNS hijack is still a dangerous attack in 2021. A large part of the Internet still relies on DNS in a similar manner as in 2008, and is exposed to attacks of the same types.</p>

					<div><p><span>The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DNS cache poisoning attacks</strong>, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities</strong> that could lead to remote code execution.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>DNS Cache Poisoning:</strong> The impact of DNS cache poisoning of the routing equipment DNS forwarding server can potentially lead to different kinds of fraud if users believe they are browsing to one website but are actually routed to another.</p>
<p>Traffic that might be subverted includes regular Internet browsing as well as other types of traffic, such as emails, SSH, remote desktop, RDP video and voice calls, software updates, and so on. Some of these protocols have built-in measures to mitigate this type of attack, with varying degrees of effectiveness and so YMMV (Your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span>DNS Cache Poisoning</span></strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png" alt="" width="529" height="234" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png 702w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></p>
<p><strong>(2) Device take over: </strong>In addition to cache poisoning, every device on which an attacker can perform DNS cache poisoning can also potentially be taken over by the attacker. For example, in the case of a router, the attacker would then have complete control over all traffic going in and out of the network.</p>
<p>There are additional impacts possible for these types of attacks. <strong><em>These are hypotheticals</em></strong>, since to our knowledge they have never been performed by a malicious actor in this way, but they are a definite possibility if the vulnerabilities are exploited correctly. Even so, given the hypothetical nature of the situation, it is hard to analyze how likely they are to actually occur and what value they could bring to different malicious actors. These possibilities include:<br><strong>(A) Massive DDOS</strong>: Diversion of a large amount of web-traffic to an attacker-controlled website could be used to generate massive JavaScript-fueled Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Simplistic calculations show that the size of the attack could be on the same order of magnitude as the biggest DDOS attacks performed to date.</p>
<p><span><strong>Massive DDOS<br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png" alt="" width="571" height="266" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png 818w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-300x140.png 300w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-768x358.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"><br></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(B) Reverse DDOS</strong>: Prevention of certain users from accessing a website and logging of access attempts to a domain.</p>
<h3><span>Reverse DDOS<strong><br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png" alt="" width="369" height="289" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png 721w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> “<b>Semi-</b><strong><b>Wormable</b>” <b>attacks</b></strong>: In situations where a mobile device moves between networks, the attack may be semi-wormable. It is not wormable in the traditional sense, since there are some pre-conditions and efforts needed on the attacker side for the exploit replication, but is semi-wormable in the sense that the exploit can continue to spread between vulnerable devices without explicit user interaction and without need for additional attacker access. In this scenario, a mobile device that was previously browsing in a network which uses an infected dnsmasq server receives a bad DNS record. When the device reaches a new network, it could infect the new network as well.</p>

            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A man froze to death overnight on Saturday just steps from the downtown Montreal shelter where he’d been keeping warm.</p>
<p>
	Now that shelter’s staff is speaking out against Quebec’s current regime of public health rules, which had forced them to kick the man out at night even when there were beds available. Montreal authorities say they had been trying to reopen the shelter at night, even if that didn't happen in time.</p>
<p>
	The man was Innu, said the director of the Native Women’s Shelter of Montreal, Nakuset. She first said on Twitter on Monday that he was Inuk.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec coroner's office, which is investigating the death, identified him as 51-year-old Raphael Andre.</p>
<p>
	Staff at the Open Door shelter, where Andre was a regular, said he had a meal and a shower at the Parc Ave. shelter on Saturday night, but he died later that night.</p>
<p>
	“Raphael, because he was under the influence, fell asleep in a porta-potty just a minute away from the shelter,” Heather Brunet, who works at the shelter, told CTV News on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	“He froze to death in the porta-potty... when he could have been here, but instead, because of these [public health] regulations, we weren’t allowed to have clients here overnight.”</p>

<!--endPolopolyEmbed-->	</div>
</div>
<p>
	The Open Door, on Parc Ave., used to allow people inside all night, but not to sleep. In the pandemic, however, it equipped its shelter with Plexiglass barriers and 65 beds to allow people to sleep relatively safely.</p>
<p>
	But in early January, the shelter was asked by health authorities to stop allowing people to use the beds or to be in the shelter at all after 9:30, amid a COVID-19 outbreak there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Finding beds for homeless Montrealers has gotten even more pressing in the last two weeks with the introduction of an 8 p.m. nightly curfew across the province, lasting until Feb. 8.</p>
<p>
	The city has said there are enough beds in total for the homeless. In recent months Montreal health authorities have created hundreds of new shelter beds in response to the pandemic, including <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/first-major-outbreaks-among-homeless-montrealers-lead-to-expanded-red-zone-new-hotel-shelter-1.5247962">two hotels converted to temporary shelters</a>.</p>
<p>
	Whether people are actually getting to those new spaces each night is a different question. Some of the city's longstanding smaller shelters, with clientele who have been returning for many years, outfitted their spaces to accommodate people overnight in a way they hadn't previously, as the Open Door did.</p>
<p>
	But some in this smaller group were then closed entirely or overnight when they were deemed not safe enough by COVID-19 standards. It's unclear if their clientele are making use of the new beds elsewhere.</p>
<h3>
	ALONE ON THE STREETS</h3>
<p>
	Montreal police wouldn't answer any questions about Andre's death as the coroner is now investigating.</p>
<p>
	Staff at the Open Door said Monday that they'd heard various reports about what happened to Andre the night of his death: he may have experienced violence, in addition to the cold and his inebriation.</p>
<p>
	What was clear, said John Tessier, who works at the shelter, is that he would have been safe if the shelter had been open as usual.</p>
<p>
	"Every day last week he was the last person out of the door, oftentimes wanting to stay. If we'd have been open, he definitely would have been sleeping inside the centre overnight," said Tessier.</p>
<p>
	"When people are inside, if there's any type of distress, we're able to assist them -- there's people observing them all night and there for support," he said.</p>
<p>
	"Unfortunately, this man was forced to be outside and passed away in a public toilet, when he could have been inside in safety."</p>
<p>
	Tessier said that authorities have been making an effort to get people to the available shelter beds with special shuttle buses, but the last one leaves around 9 p.m., half an hour before the Open Door closes. And occasionally when people do arrive at the night shelters, they're told there are no more beds, he said.</p>
<p>
	"It breaks our heart to send people into the bitter-cold winter of Montreal, and after curfew, at the risk of getting tickets," Tessier said. "As we see, this is life-and-death for some people."</p>
<p>
	Nakuset said that the last few months has been adding up to a deadly combination, with shelter resources stretched thin and services cut back due to COVID-19 rules, and then the curfew.</p>
<p>
	"I was really afraid that disaster would happen before the government did something, and now that disaster has happened," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Maybe he called out for help and no one heard him because he was alone."</p>
<h3>
	<strong>CITY WAS TRYING TO REOPEN SHELTER OVERNIGHT: MAYOR</strong></h3>
<p>
	Brunet said Andre's death was avoidable and that front-line shelter workers are well trained. They're asking public health authorities to let them stay open overnight.</p>
<p>
	Montreal Public Health said that, in fact, they didn't order the shelter to close in the long term overnight. A "temporary suspension of the warming station was issued on January 2," it said in a statement, amid a major outbreak at the time.</p>
<p>
	But the outbreak ended on Jan. 11, said spokesman Eric Forest.</p>
<p>
	On Jan. 12, Montreal Public Health issued a recommendation to the local homelessness services board, sharing it with the relevant health authority for downtown Montreal, "supporting a possible reopening" of the Open Door overnight if it met health guidelines, he said.</p>
<p>
	"This recommendation is currently being evaluated by the Montreal health network," Forest said.</p>
<p>
	Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also said in a statement that the city was already looking at reopening the "warming station" of the Open Door overnight, days before Andre's death.</p>
<p>
	"I am terribly saddened by this death and I offer my sincere condolences to his loved ones and to his entire community," Plante said.</p>
<p>
	The city does want to make sure people can be inside the shelter at night and had already been in talks to do so "for several days," she said, "to ensure a safe place for people roaming the Milton-Parc sector at night."</p>
<p>
	Her statement didn't make clear whether the city wanted to reopen the beds or just to make the shelter accessible overnight.</p>
<p>
	The city would welcome the local health authority, the CIUSSS du Centre-Ouest-de-l'Ile-de-Montréal, "moving in this direction," she added.</p>
<h3>
	HOMELESS MONTREALERS BEING VACCINATED</h3>
<p>
	Montreal authorities announced last week that they would begin <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-surpasses-4-000-covid-19-deaths-2-000-homeless-people-to-be-vaccinated-1.5265231">vaccinating 2,000 homeless people</a> in the city, moving them up on the prioritization list. Those shots were scheduled to begin late last week and carry on through this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On Monday, they confirmed that a few dozen people received their first doses, while on Tuesday morning, up to 200 more will get their shots.</p>
<p>
	In order to line up recipients, shelter staff are asking people staying at one of the major hotel-shelters, near Place Emilie-Gamelin, just east of downtown, whether they want the shot.</p>
<p>
	Those who agree are given tickets that must be presented at the vaccination time in order to get the shot.</p>

              <p>Problems emerging from data are common in research as well as in the industry. Those problems are dealt with as part of our project, but we usually don't bother solving them at their origin. We fix the data locally once, and we go on with our project. This is certainly a valid method in some cases, but as we share data more and more between projects, we are finding ourselves repeating the same processes over time and across teams. This issue is particularly true for public datasets shared by many people to train many machine learning models. I will show you how to create, maintain, and contribute to a long-living dataset that will update itself automatically across projects, using git and DVC as versioning systems, and DAGsHub as a host for the datasets.</p><h2 id="changing-datasets-is-a-common-process">Changing datasets is a common process</h2><p>I remember that during my undergraduate studies, I had to generate an instance segmentation model for cucumber plant parts, using a custom dataset of segmented leaves, cucumbers, and flowers. At a very early stage, I discovered I couldn't get reasonable results with the data given initially. I decided I would fix the annotations myself on about a dozen pictures. As expected, this solved 80 percent of the issues I was having. This is a good opportunity to say that manual data labor is underrated. Investing a few hours in fixing the data was the best thing I could do for the project. Then, of course, I went on with my life, leaving the fixed dataset on the lab computer, but knowing that eventually, my fixes were going to vanish.</p><p>Naturally, this process was gradual. I started with the original dataset, then I fixed a part of the annotations. At some point, I added completely new pictures, decided to redo some of them. I iterated over the data with multiple manipulations over time. Many of them I treated as "Debug trial-and-errors", naturally not keeping track of my working directory rigorously. During those iterations, I ran training sessions, while doing my best to keep a detailed record of my "experience". If you are still reading, you probably understand exactly what I am talking about. Well, the world has changed since then, and many data versioning tools have evolved to help. This is a good opportunity to recommend this <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-version-control-tools/">comparison between data version control tools</a> we published at the end of 2020.</p><h2 id="what-is-data-versioning">What is data versioning?</h2><p>While my project was a total mess data-wise, its code was very well tracked by git. The reason is that I could just run the following magical commands that everyone knows:</p><pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "fixed training input directory"
</code></pre><p>Back then I wasn't able to do any magical command of that sort for my data. Now, with <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> and DAGsHub in the world, this is no longer the case. There is no reason on earth why you should not at least have a simple code and data versioning system set in place. If you are not familiar with DVC, I recommend you go through <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/">this basic data versioning tutorial</a>, but it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a prerequisite to understand the rest of this post. All you really need to know is that now we have a new, magical command:</p><pre><code>dvc commit
</code></pre><p>That will create a snapshot of the tracked data, without inflating your git repository.</p><p>While data versioning solves the problem of managing data in the context of your machine learning project, it brings with it a new approach to managing <strong>datasets</strong>. This approach, also described as data registries <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries">here</a>, consists of creating <strong>a git repository entirely dedicated to managing a dataset</strong>. This means that instead of training models on frozen datasets - something researchers, students, kagglers, and open source machine learning contributors often do - you could link your project to a dataset (or to any file for that matter), and treat it as a dependency. After all, <strong>data can and should be treated as code</strong>, and follow through a review process. You can read more about that in another post about <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-bugs-how-to-fix-them/">data bugs and how to fix them</a>.</p><p><strong>Warning - Don't continue reading if you feel threatened by knowledge!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc/giphy.gif"><p><small><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/arielle-m-star-trek-information-overload-3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc">via GIPHY</a></small></p></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I am joking, of course, this isn't going to be rocket science at all.

git init
dvc init
</code></pre><p>Congrats! Your living-dataset is alive. Now we need to add some files to it.</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif"></figure><p>In my case, I took a handful of screenshots from a beloved TV Show, and annotated my favorite character in it, using the awesome open source <a href="https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator">COCO annotator project</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/annotator-demo2_1.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After annotating around 40 pictures, I knew it was going to be enough for a pre-trained Mask-RCNN with a ResNet50 backbone, to give decent results (15 would have probably been enough too, but it was too fun to stop). I exported a <code>.json</code> annotation file, put it in my repository along with the screenshots I took. At this point my working directory looked like this:</p><pre><code>.

</code></pre><p>Since I like visualizations I wrote a script in <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/Playground.ipynb">this python notebook</a> to render previews of my dataset into a <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/preview">preview directory</a>, which will also be tracked by DVC. Then I just push my code and data to my remote repository, so that I can access it from everywhere, and share it with my collaborators.</p><pre><code>git push origin master
dvc push -r origin
</code></pre><p>Note: I skipped the part of opening a repository on GitHub / DAGsHub and setting up the remote storage, <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/#pushing-code-data-and-models-to-dagshub">the tutorial</a> should cover that.</p><h2 id="using-a-living-dataset-in-a-machine-learning-project">Using a living-dataset in a machine learning project</h2><p>Now it is time to use my dataset as a dependency in my machine learning project. I will not be able to recreate my cucumber project from school, since I do not have access to the data, so I will substitute the cucumbers with the beloved fictional character from above.</p><p>I want my project directory to look like the following:</p><pre><code>.
├── data
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── preprocessed
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── raw
└── src
</code></pre><p>I want to import a directory from my dataset and treat it as <code>raw</code> files. I can do it by running from inside my repository:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p data/raw

dvc import -o data/raw/images \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/images

dvc import -o data/raw/annotations \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/annotations</code></pre><p>This will specifically download the directories <code>images</code> and <code>annotations</code> from inside my dataset repository, and keep information on how to continue tracking the changes made in it. More on tracking the changes will be explained later, but this is pretty much it.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 921w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the chart above you can see a representation of how it works. The arrows go in the direction of dependencies. Every time I know the dataset has changed, I just run the command</p><pre><code>dvc update
</code></pre><p>The <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/update">command above</a> will check for changes in the tracked ref of the repository, and pull them to my local directories. Then I re-run my pipeline from scratch - Train my model, save the best one, and commit my results. Notice that we can use this method of <code>dvc import</code> + <code>dvc update</code> to get the output model as a dependency in another project if we wanted to.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for reading along, I hope you enjoyed it. The project is still a work in progress (but what project isn't?). So if you find mistakes, or improvements to make, either in the dataset or the model, then just contribute to them! It's fairly easy to fork repositories, pull the data, push it, and merge it. Especially with <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/">data-science pull requests</a>. The process can easily be adapted to any segmentation dataset, so feel free to do so as well.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asher-yartsev/">Asher</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or-shemesh-4a99a7101/">Or</a>, my fellow students from the original segmentation project that gave me inspiration for this mini-project.</p><p>Here are some results just for fun!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/grogus.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>There should be anti-trust laws that make it illegal for social media software to be closed and centralized. What does this mean and why is it important? Let’s start with the why.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h2><p>Social media apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter all have something in common: They benefit from so-called network effects. Simply said, this means that the value of the service increases for each user as additional users join the service. For example, you wouldn’t use Instagram if all you had was an empty feed or WhatsApp if none of your friends were on it.</p><p>A network effect is both hard to achieve and hard to destroy. That’s why it’s almost impossible for a new company with little funds to compete with existing services. And that’s why almost no users leave to competing products (even if there were any). Heck, it’s even hard to start a social media company if you have a shit ton of cash (just ask the folks from Google Plus).</p><p>Companies realized that there’s no way to create a social network if you charge users, even if that amount would be something small like a few dollars. You just can’t get enough people on there to make the network as a whole valuable enough for all users. They also realized that the data they collect from people using their social network is extremely valuable to other companies, namely advertisers. That’s why almost all social networks make money by showing you ads based on your data.</p><p>In the last few years, social media became insanely popular and the primary source of information for a lot of people. This development came with a bunch of problems.</p><p>One such problem is misinformation. Because of inherent mechanisms that make sharing easy, information spreads super fast on social media. And so does misinformation. And because anyone can post anything, there’s a truck load of misinformation being shared and consumed. You might have heard the term Fake News. The problem is though, that sometimes real facts are also being regarded as fake and if enough users share it, people think it’s true. Of course, evil companies figured out how to automate the spread of misinformation with bots and ads and succesfully shaped public opinion to their advantage. By now, it’s clear that Russian agents meddled with the 2016 US elections through this medium.</p><p>Another problem is censorship. Twitter and Facebook have always been banning accounts that post content which is against their terms of service. Stuff like child porn and obvious hate speech. Recently, they also banned the President of the United States, Donald Trump, for inciting violence in connection with the events at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On the one hand, Twitter and Facebook are private companies and can decide who they ban from their platform. On the other hand, they have become the main publishing platform for a lot of public figures, including Trump. Therefore, many opponents of censorship on social media say that Twitter and friends should be regulated as public forums and the government should decide who gets to have a Twitter account, not Twitter itself.</p><p>A third problem is power. As we have seen, it’s hard for new companies to compete with existing social media companies, and it’s hard for users to leave the platform for a lack of alternatives and existing network effects. This means that Facebook, Twitter and Google (not with Search, but e.g. with YouTube) have a lot of power. That’s why they can pull a lot of shit (remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?), but get away with a slap on the wrist because users just can’t leave.</p><p>So, what’s all this to do with closed and central and what does that even mean?</p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2><p>Let’s get more technical. When saying “closed and central social media”, I actually refer to their underlying protocols. A protocol simply is a specification of how two or more parties communicate with each other. Like, what kind of data can be sent, how it is sent, what kind of responses can be expected and so on. Think of it like a set of rules.</p><p>Open protocols are protocols which are defined openly for everyone to see what the rules are. Closed protocols are proprietary and not shared publicly. Centralized protocols only allow one central authority (e.g. server), whereas decentralized protocols allow for servers and services to talk to each other.</p><p>The internet is built on open, decentralized protocols. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol (IP)</a> defines how data packages are sent around and is literally <em>the</em> basis for our open and amazing internet. Another one that you probably use every day is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a> - that’s how email works. There are also offline examples of open and decentralized protocols, such as the physical mail system. I can send a letter from Berlin to San Fransisco and it works, although it’s not the same company providing the service in Germany and the US. I can also call or text my friend, even though I’m with Verizon and she’s with AT&amp;T.</p><p>Closed and central protocols don’t allow this open interoperability. If I want to read and send Tweets, I have to use the central service controlled completely centrally by Twitter. If I want to watch a video on YouTube, I have to use YouTube. If I want to send a message to my group of friends, I have to use WhatsApp since that’s the only chat app they (and two billion other people) use.</p><p>Compare this to email. If I have an email account with Fastmail and you have an account with Gmail, we can still communicate with each other. Imagine if Google had “invented” email and made it a centralized system, we would all need to be on Gmail to talk to each other. Pretty crappy, right? But that’s exactly the case with all social media today.</p><p>If WhatsApp would use an open and decentralized protocol, let’s call it Chat Protocol (CP) other companies could also offer WhatsApp services and host their own server. Let’s say that other apps like Telegram and Signal would also use the same protocol, CP. I could easily use Signal to message my friends on WhatsApp. It would give every person the freedom to choose a service provider they like (for whatever reason). It would allow for fair competition, and remove power from one central entity. If your account gets banned from one provider, you can create a new account with a different provider and keep talking to your friends.</p><p>Of course, misinformation can still spread if uncontrolled. But with a decentralized system, you would have many service providers dealing with the problem and probably do a better job than one player that needs to deal with all of the world’s misinformation.</p><p>Of course, the flip side of too little censorship means that there will be more accounts with pedophiles and racists. But today, hosting providers are already quite good with taking this type of content offline (e.g. websites), so there’s no reason to think that they couldn’t do it with a decentralized social media app, too.</p><p>You see, there are many advantages to using open and decentralized protocols. It’s also obvious why big social media companies do not want to use them and instead create these walled gardens to maximize their profit and stronghold. I wager that, left alone, these companies will never do the right thing and open up and decentralize their networks. (One possible expection: Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">has announced</a> that they eventually want to open up, but it remains to be seen what that exactly will turn into.)</p><p>So, what’s the solution? One solution could be market-based: Just make software based on open protocols that is better and users will jump ship and start using those. In fact, these alternatives already exist. For example, there’s Mastodon, a decentralized Twitter alternative, or Matrix, a decentralized instant messaging app. But compared to Twitter and WhatsApp, noone uses these alternatives. Why? Well, of course they need to get better and improve their usability and what not, but the main reason is what I mentioned before: It’s damn hard to compete with an existing social media service because of network effects. And the more users they get, the stronger the network effects become.</p><p>I’m not saying that we shouldn’t encourage people to join Mastodon and other services and support them to make their services better. I’m just saying it won’t cut it. Not by a long shot.</p><p>Like with all monopolies, this is a case where the free market doesn’t automatically lead to the best outcome.</p><p>My suggestion is the following: <strong>Make it illegal for social media companies to have closed and decentralized networks after a certain size.</strong> The size is up to debate, but I think it should be measured by active users.</p><p>For example, all companies that have more than 50 million monthly active users need to open up and decentralize their protocol or use an existing one.</p><p>There are already a bunch of anti-trust laws that regulate monopolies and concentration of market power. Why not revise and extend them to take into consideration today’s business and technology landscape?</p></article></div>]]>

<li>You place a £1,000 deposit per satellite (fully refundable) to secure yourself in the production queue and at the “early adopter rate”.</li>
<li>You hire a <a href="https://orbastro.com/flat-sat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> flat-sat </a> to design/program your payload for compatibility with the platform.</li>
<li>Once ready, you pull the trigger for platform build and pay the remaining fee.</li>
<li>Once the platform is built (nominally 1 month later), you come on-site and integrate your payload with assistance from our engineers. This should not take more than 2 days because of your upfront work on the <a href="https://orbastro.com/flat-sat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> flat-sat </a> .</li>
<li>Whilst you are on-site, we put the fully integrated satellite through fight-acceptance testing. This should not take more than 2-3 days after your payload has been integrated.</li>
<li>After passing flight-acceptance testing and further health-checks, the satellite is securely stored on-site in an appropriate environment until the launch provider is ready to receive it.</li>

<p><strong> £60,000 baseline </strong></p>
<p>The price includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A fully assembled 3U satellite platform</li>
<li>Engineering support with payload integration, on-site with us</li>
<li>Full flight-acceptance testing and associated health-checks, on-site with us</li>

</ul>
<p>We are currently building a batch-production facility for this product-line. As such, 3U satellite platforms will only become commercially available from May-21 onwards. Nominal lead-time for production of platforms will be 1 month*. Between now and then, OrbAstro will be taking deposits that will secure customers in the production queue and will freeze their price point to the “early adopter rate”.</p>
<p><strong> Deposits are £1,000 per satellite. Deposits are fully refundable. </strong></p>
<p>The current price is what we are calling the “early adopter rate”. Though OrbAstro still makes a reasonable margin at the “early adopter rate” price, it will go up over the period of 2022 as the platform gains more heritage and becomes an established solution. The next nearest alternative to OrbAstro will not be able to provide a similar solution for anything less than £500,000 over the coming few years. And though OrbAstro is looking to lower the barrier for entry to enable the emergence of new space markets and the flourishing of existing markets, this vision must be balanced against the company financing other longer-term activities aligned with <strong> lowering it further </strong> .</p>
<p><em> *Depending on demand, it could take OrbAstro ~6 months to match supply/demand requirements to stabilise at a 1-month production lead-time. As such, if you are looking to launch in 2021-2022, place your deposit now. </em></p>

<p>The first ORB-3 satellite platform with a commercial payload onboard is launching in Q2 2021 on a SpaceX Falcon 9. It will have all of the standard subsystems listed. Additionally, it will have deployable solar panels, both Telos-10 and Telos-40, and both S-band transceiver &amp; Ka-band transmitter + antennas. OrbAstro currently has subsequent platforms booked for launch in late-2021 and mid-2022, both 6U variants (ORB-6). For the most part, subsystems on the 3U platforms are identical to those on the 6U platforms. The OrbAstro team has a long history of developing complex satellite subsystems, from concept to orbital operations.</p>

<p><strong>TYLER COWEN: </strong>Hello, everyone, and welcome back to <em>Conversations with Tyler</em>. We are recording on Armenian Christmas Day with <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/noubar-afeyan" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/noubar-afeyan">Noubar Afeyan</a>. He is founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/about">Flagship Pioneering</a>, but these days, perhaps, best known as co-founder and chairman of the board of <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna</a>, which has produced one of the two best anti-COVID vaccines in the world. Noubar, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>NOUBAR AFEYAN: </strong>Welcome. We say <em>Shnorhavor Amanor yev Surb Tznund</em>. That’s Merry Christmas in Armenian, and we celebrate this day as our Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>A very simple question to start: which aspect of entrepreneurship is hardest to teach to other people?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>The fact that it is a combination of mindsets and beliefs as opposed to a birthright and connections.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How did you learn how to teach that?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>By putting myself in the shoes of the students and imagining what I would have wanted to know before I launched down a path of doing entrepreneurship in as professional a way as I could fathom because I also think that, generally, the field believes that entrepreneurship is condemned to be a perpetual, improvisational, unprofessional act.</p>
<p>I, some 25 years ago, decided that it would be much more productive if we could think about which aspects could be made more professional. The first way to do that is to figure out that it’s neither genetic nor somehow only about these amorphous characteristics than hard work, learning ways to do the future-backwards planning that we’re involved in.</p>
<p>It turns out those things can be learned by both practice and by hearing about case examples and how people make decisions.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Now, at Flagship, you have a string of successes of what, over 40 companies that you have helped to create. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>Yes. In my case, yes. The Flagship has a larger number than that, probably closer to a hundred now.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> How is creating a company as a co-creator a different skill than being either a VC who picks winners or doing all the work yourself in building the company? How would you best describe the nature of that skill that you and Flagship have?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>Well, I should say that Flagship is itself an experiment in a new breed of company that conceives and creates and launches and develops companies. A company that develops companies is not a traditional way one fathoms what a company does. Our products are effectively platforms that are embodied within companies.</p>
<p>In that regard, if you think of the traditional startup methodology, what one needs to do is to take a scientific breakthrough or an innovation — typically in the life sciences — that comes from academia; managerial skills to both initiate and then grow and manage the growth of; and then capital. If all three of those things come in together and coexist harmoniously, and the product works, and the pricing is right, and the execution is right, then you get a gigantic overnight success.</p>
<p>The likelihood of that happening before we get to the product and the pricing and the execution is very low because the sources of innovation, the sources of talent, and the sources of capital have a lot of, let’s say, friction among them as to what <em>they</em> think should be done.</p>
<p>Contrast that to what Flagship set out to do, which is to have the innovation capacity, the human capacity to lead, and the capital — all as part of one entity, one organization, such that they are co-deployed in pursuit of something that is therefore slightly more risky in the eyes of others, because we can persist and we can cooperate because we all share one common objective, and that is the success of that thing that we’re creating.</p>
<p>Creating a company having all three of those elements coming from the same source is a very different act than collecting and optimizing the pieces, has been my experience. I’ve done both, obviously. For the first 13 years of my life — before 2000 — of my <em>professional</em> life, I did it the traditional way, and since then we’ve been doing it this way.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Which part of entrepreneurship — biotech entrepreneurship in particular — is hardest to scale? You don’t have 792 companies, right? Something is stopping there from being more companies. What’s that scarce factor?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>It’s a good question because, usually, the form of the question I get is, what <em>is</em> limiting and why don’t you do more? I’d say the simple answer to that right now, for us, is not being forced to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let’s put it this way. If there was a need for us to create 20 companies a year instead of the six to eight that we do, I believe the same methodology could do that. And I believe that we would not scratch the surface of the possibilities of transformations that could be going on.</p>
<p>One of the things you do when you’re exploring novelty — in our case, novelty of our life-form, if you will, that is Flagship as an entity — is we’ve been pretty cautious and pretty humble about the notions that what we do can be scaled, and could be replicated, and can be effective regardless of scale.</p>
<p>That is not something that we can easily defend. We’ve given it some time to ramp up, but your question more specifically, what’s rate limiting? It’s usually about people more so than capital and innovation since we’re sourcing a lot of capital, both to start these things but also to scale them. Some roughly $5 billion of capital has gone into our collective activities over the last decade, little more than a decade of it, just as we’ve ramped up.</p>
<p>Then on the innovation side, our methodology by which we actually make inventions — which is quite different than the way scientific innovations are usually made — I don’t think that that is limited in its potential. There’s far more white space out there than there is occupied adjacencies, which is what innovation today is usually focused on. One way of saying, I think it’s about people, and it’s people who, on the one hand, need to be trained in this way of thinking about it and be willing to dedicate themselves to a pretty contrarian way of life.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>When speed is of the essence, as it was with the Moderna mRNA vaccine, how do management styles have to differ?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>Well, Moderna is a company that was already 10 years old by the time the virus appeared. Unfortunately for the virus, there has been quite a lot of time to get ready with a platform and with a team that was assembled, even though it was still a massive undertaking to do something that had never been done before.</p>
<p>From a managerial standpoint, it’s a combination of being able to focus very rapidly on the task at hand, be able to make rapid decisions which requires a level of pre-alignment — alignment around how to do what we do, alignment around values — and then execution with rapid iteration. All of those things are crucial to perform at that type of uncertainty and that type of pace.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the Moderna case, they have nine years of upbringing before the pandemic that was filled with that culture, that set of principles. So, we were somewhat lucky in being poised to take on things that others would consider — well, first of all, they all considered it impossible, but that was not new to Moderna because Moderna has, for the last 10 years, heard that everything it’s doing is impossible, and then improbable, and then undesirable, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Now, hopefully, we’ve at least shown that, in one case, it can be effective and impactful. And then that opens up a whole lot of new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a now-famous two-day origin story, right? You don’t even have the physical instantiation of the vaccine. You just have the code, and in two days, you come up with, basically, the relevant innovation. Now, during those two days, what are you doing? Are you peering over someone’s shoulder? Are you by the swimming pool? Are you on Zoom calls all day? How do those two days look for you?</p>
<p><strong>AFEYAN: </strong>Actually, for me, my role as a co-founder and chairman has been to work with the leadership team — obviously separate from the board itself — on a variety of strategy issues that required very rapid decision-making. The decision to go down this path is one that involved more than just having a sequence.</p>
<p>In fact, there was very little doubt in any of our minds that we could go from the sequence to a vaccine in a short period of time. We’ve done it many, many, many times before. It’s just that that speed wasn’t needed or appreciated by anybody. Didn’t mean that we took three months before and now we did it in two days. It always can be done pretty quickly — that step, but the decision-making that preceded it was, were we willing to gear up …</p></div></div></div></div>

Just a line of code, but it is actually the tip of the iceberg:</p><pre><code><p><span>q</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>First, I try to acquire the object lock of <code>q</code> because <code>put</code> is a synchronized method.</p><ul><li>If the attempt does not succeed, I keep waiting.</li><li>Otherwise, I manage to enter the <code>while (count == items.length)</code> test, check if the queue is full.</li></ul><p>As I hold the lock, and both <code>put</code> and <code>take</code> are <code>synchronized</code>, no other threads could be executing either of the methods. That is to say, no other threads could potentially modify the object state. This is important because I want to make sure my test result reflects the very truth.</p><p>There are two possible test results:</p><ul><li>The queue is full. With <code>wait</code>, I release the lock so that other threads can acquire the lock and therefore modify the state, ask the OS to suspend myself (the current thread), and let the OS wake me up when the queue may turn non-full. Upon waking, I contend for the lock attempting to enter the <code>synchronized</code> block again. Note that once I manage to re-enter the <code>synchronized</code> block, the non-full condition predicate may be false because other threads may have acquired the lock and changed the object's state between when I was awakened and re-acquired the lock. Therefore I want to test <code>count == items.length</code> again and that's why the test has to be in a <code>while</code> loop rather than an <code>if</code>.</li><li>The queue is not full. I enter the <code>enqueue</code> method.</li></ul><p>Once I enter the <code>enqueue</code> method, I place the element on the underlying array. The operation is thread-safe because I still hold the lock. Besides, with <code>notifyAll</code>, I notify all waiting threads including threads waiting for the blocking queue to become non-empty.</p><p>Lastly, return the object lock and I have finally put an element to the queue. Phew, what a line of code!</p><h2><span id="intrinsic-vs-explicit"></span><a href="#intrinsic-vs-explicit">Intrinsic vs. explicit</a></h2><p>The simple implementation leverages the intrinsic locking and condition queue mechanism built into the <code>Object</code> class.</p><p>Intrinsic locking uses the object itself as a lock. When a thread invokes a <code>synchronized</code> method, it automatically acquires the lock for the object and releases it when the method returns.</p><p>Intrinsic condition queue uses the object itself as a condition queue whose elements are threads. When a thread invokes <code>wait</code>, it puts itself in the condition queue. When a thread invokes <code>notifyAll</code>, it awakes all threads in the queue - they are waiting for the condition predicate of interest to become true.</p><p>Even though the intrinsic locking and condition queue are easy to use, they can be a little confusing when a condition queue is used with more than one condition predicate. In the case of <code>ArrayBlockingQueue</code>, <code>put</code> needs the condition predicate "the blocking queue is non-full" being true to proceed, and <code>take</code> needs the condition predicate "the blocking queue is non-empty" being true to proceed. When T1 is awakened because someone called <code>notifyAll</code>, that doesn't mean that the condition predicate "non-full" it was waiting for is now true. This is like having your toaster and coffee maker share a single bell; when it rings, you still have to look to see which device raised the signal.</p><p>Ideally, when T1 is awakened, it knows for sure that it is because the condition predicate "non-full" turned true recently. This is where explicit locking and condition variables come into play. Luckily, by leveraging <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock</code> and <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</code>, we're able to achieve the goal by modifying only a few lines of code.</p><h2><span id="a-better-implementation"></span><a href="#a-better-implementation">A better implementation</a></h2><p>The implementation explicitly define a lock and two conditions.</p><pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>java</span><span>.</span><span>util</span><span>.</span><span>concurrent</span><span>.</span><span>locks</span><span>.</span><span>Condition</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>java</span><span>.</span><span>util</span><span>.</span><span>concurrent</span><span>.</span><span>locks</span><span>.</span><span>ReentrantLock</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>ArrayBlockingQueue</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>BlockingQueue</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span> items</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> takeIndex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> putIndex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> count</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>ReentrantLock</span><span> lock</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>Condition</span><span> notEmpty</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>Condition</span><span> notFull</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>ArrayBlockingQueue</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> capacity</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>capacity </span><span>&lt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>IllegalArgumentException</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        items </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span>[</span><span>capacity</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        lock </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>ReentrantLock</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        notEmpty </span><span>=</span><span> lock</span><span>.</span><span>newCondition</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        notFull </span><span>=</span><span> lock</span><span>.</span><span>newCondition</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p><code>put</code> leverages the lock and the non-full condition.

          <p><span><a href="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/0default.jpg" data-fancybox="ipg-737f2fdd" data-caption=""><img src="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/thumb/0default.jpg" srcset="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/thumb-2x/0default.jpg 2x,https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/thumb-3x/0default.jpg 3x,https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/thumb-4x/0default.jpg 4x" alt=""></a></span> In the early time of home computers, at the beginning of the 1980's, hard disks and even floppy disks were too expensive for home use. The cheapest way for storing large amounts of data was the cassette tape. Cassettes and tape recorders were affordable and available in almost any household.</p>
<p>In this blog article, I'm going to explain how the Sinclair ZX Spectrum stored programs on cassette tapes. Other home computers of that time, like the Commodore 64 or Amstrad CPC, worked in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Cassette tapes were designed to store audio signals like voice or music, so the inventors of the home computers had to find a way to convert data to audio signals. The easiest way is to serialize the data to a bit stream of 1's and 0's, and generate a long rectangular wave cycle for "1" and a short rectangular wave cycle for "0". This is what the ZX Spectrum actually does!</p>
<p>A short wave cycle is generated by giving power to the audio output for 855 so called T-states, and then turning off the power for another 855 T-states. A "T-state" is the time of a single clock pulse of the Z80-A CPU. As the CPU of a classic ZX Spectrum is clocked with 3.5 MHz, a T-state has a duration of 286 ns. The duration of a short wave cycle is thus 489 Âµs, giving an audio frequency of about 2,045 Hz. The long wave cycle is just twice as long.</p>
<p>Due to all kind of filters in the analog audio path, the rectangular signal is smoothed to a sinusoidal signal when played back. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger">Schmitt trigger</a> inside the ZX Spectrum's hardware converts the audio signal back to a rectangular shape. Since the audio signal can have different amplitudes or could even be inverted, the hardware only cares for signal edges, not for levels. All that the loader routine now has to do is to measure the duration of the pulses, regenerate the bit stream, and put the bytes back together.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/data.png" alt=""></span></p>
<p>If you think that things cannot be <em>that</em> easy, you are right. ðŸ˜„ The most difficult part for the loader is to find the start of the bit stream. If it is off by only one cycle (or even just a pulse), all the bytes are shifted by one bit, and the result is useless. All kind of noise on the tape makes it impossible to just wait for the signal to start, though.</p>
<p>For this reason, the recording starts with a leader signal, followed by a sync wave cycle, followed by the bit stream itself. The leader signal is just a continuous wave with a pulse length of 2,168 T-states, giving an 806 Hz tone that is displayed by red and cyan border colors on the TV. The sync wave cycle is a pulse of 667 T-States "on", followed by 735 T-states "off". After that, the actual data stream begins, which is displayed in blue and yellow border colors. When the last bit was transmitted, the data stream just ends.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/440/sync.png" alt=""></span></p>
<p>So when the ZX Spectrum loads a file from tape, it first waits for the 806 Hz leader signal. If it was detected for at least 317 ms, it waits for the sync pulses, then it starts reading the bit sequence until there is a timeout while waiting for the next pulse.</p>
<p>It is a very simple way to store data on tape. And still, it is surprisingly reliable. After 30 years, I could <a href="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/390/recovering-old-zx-spectrum-tapes.html">recover almost all files</a> from my old cassette tapes. Some of them were of the cheapest brands I could get my hands on back in 1987.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage is that this method is very slow. With 489 Âµs for a "0" and 978 Âµs for a "1", saving just 48 KBytes of data can take up to 6 minutes, giving an average bit rate of 1,363 bps (yes, <em>bits</em> per second). If we were to save a single 3 MBytes mp3 file that way, it would take almost 5 hours (and 5 cassettes with 60 minutes recording time each).</p>
<p>Some commercial games used speed loaders and copy protections. Speed loaders just reduced the number of T-states for the pulses, which increased the bit rate. Some copy protections used a "clicking" leader tone, where the leader signal was interrupted before the minimal detection time of 317 ms was reached. The original loader routine could not synchronize to these kind of signals, so it was impossible to read those files into copy programs. Those protection measures could still be circumvented by copying directly from tape to tape, but this only worked a few times due to increasing audio noise.</p>
<p>In the next article, I will take a deeper look at the bit stream contents, and I will also explain where the dreaded "R Tape loading error" comes from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>We have a lot of tools at our disposal when programming for the web. Shells, editors,
IDEs, emulators, simulators, browsers and their associated dev tools, compilers,
version control systems like GIT, build tools like webpack, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A common pitfall is to learn just enough of these tools to get by. We can end up
using a shallow subset of these tools features like proverbial hammers rendering
many problems nails. This can make day to day development <strong>alot harder</strong> than
it needs to be.</p>
<p>You will spend a lot of time with these tools during your programming career.
It’s worth getting to know them well. In this post I’ll share some features of
Chrome DevTools you may not be aware of that I’ve found to be most useful in day
to day hacking on thick client apps.</p>
<p>So with that said grab that flux capacitor. Where we’re going we don’t need
console.log!</p>
<h2>Console Utilities</h2>
<p>Most folks are familiar with accessing browser globals <code>window</code> and <code>document</code>
from the console pane but you might not be aware Chrome DevTools ships with a
bunch of console utilities alongside these. Here’s a couple worth knowing.</p>
<h3>$0 and friends</h3>
<p>Say we want to obtain a reference to a particular DOM Element in the console so
we can interact with it. There are a few common ways people tend to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a DOM method from the console like <code>document.querySelector(selector)</code></li>
<li>Use <code>$(selector)</code> which is an alias for <code>document.querySelector</code>.</li>
<li>Right click on an element from the Elements pane and select “store as
global variable”.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another way that proves a lot more useful particularly when your
debugging concerns multiple elements. Meet <code>$0</code> and it’s friends <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>,
<code>$4</code>. These are special references in the console that point to the last
5 elements selected in the Elements Panel.</p>
<p>Right click a webpage and choose “Inspect Element”. Now navigate to
the console tab of dev tools drawer and type <code>$0</code> and hit Enter.</p>
<p>You should see the element you selected logged to the console.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/$0.png" alt="$0" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3>The events must flow: monitorEvents</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to be able to see what events a particular DOM Element is
recieving as you interact with a web page?</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve attached some event handlers but things aren’t being triggered as
you expect so you need a closer look. Sure you could throw in a <code>console.log</code>
into the event listener code but that just works for one event handler and
it also involves adding and removing code in order to debug things. Laborious!</p>
<p>The <code>monitorEvents</code> API of chrome dev tools allows you to see all events that
are recieved by any DOM Element as you interact with the page without adding any
additional app code. Let’s try it out.</p>
<p>Open the Elements pane and select the element you wish to monitor for events.</p>
<p>Now we are going to use our special <code>$0</code> reference we learned earlier to pass a
reference to the DOM Element we want to observe. Go to the console and type
<code>monitorEvents($0)</code>.</p>
<p>Calling <code>monitorEvents</code> with a single argument will monitor <em>all</em> events for
that Element. We can also specify the exact event we want to monitor by
supplying a second argument: <code>monitorEvents($0, 'click')</code>.</p>
<p>Hit Enter to invoke the <code>monitorEvents</code> function and then interact with the DOM
Element you chose to monitor in the web page. You should now see a stream of
events received by the Element you are monitoring logged to the console.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/monitor-events.png" alt="Monitor Events" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2>The Command Menu</h2>
<p>The command menu is a faster way to navigate the DevTools UI and accomplish
many common tasks without having to leave your keyboard.</p>
<p>With DevTools open, you can open the command menu on Mac by pressing
<code>Command+Shift+P</code>.</p>
<p>You should now see the command menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/command-menu.png" alt="Command Menu" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The available commands are segmented in to various categories like Network,
Debugger, Rendering etc. and you can leverage the menu fuzzy search to find the
one you want quicker.</p>
<p>Take a moment to scroll through the list and get an idea of the commands
available.</p>
<h2>The DevTools Drawer</h2>
<p>DevTools provides access to it’s 9 main panes (Elements, Console, Sources etc.)
via tabs at the top of the DevTools window.</p>
<p>You’d be forgiven for not knowing that there is an additional set of 19 panes
hidden away in what’s called the DevTools <em>Drawer</em>. You can find them by
clicking the three dots on the right of the main DevTools Tab Bar and
selecting “More Tools” from the menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/drawer-menu.png" alt="Drawer" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at a couple of my favourite Drawer panes.</p>
<h3>The Coverage Pane: Optimising Performance At Build-time.</h3>
<p>The code coverage pane allows you to analyze how much CSS and JS code was
loaded versus how much was <em>used</em>. This helps to identify possible <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">code splitting</a>
opportunities in order to optimise our build and only load stuff a
user actually needs at a given time.</p>

<p>Lets perform a quick analysis. Navigate to any webpage, open the DevTools,
launch the Command Menu and type “coverage”. You should see a “Show Coverage”
command:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-drawer-command.png" alt="Coverage Drawer Command" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Hit enter and you should see a new drawer tab labelled “Coverage” and its
corresponding pane should be visible:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-drawer.png" alt="Coverage Drawer" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Click the reload button. This will instrument the CSS and JS code on the page
and reload it producing a coverage report:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-report.png" alt="Coverage Report" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>leverage <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering">network
throttling</a>
to simulate differing network conditions.</p>
<h3>Performance Monitor: Optimising Performance At Runtime.</h3>
<p>In terms of CPU/RAM, it’s safe to say developers are generally asymmetrically
much better off than the average user of apps being built with high end development
machines.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised if you get hit with a bug report out of the blue one day
complaining that your site is slow. Maybe it’s a memory leak. Maybe you are triggering
too many reflows and the CPU is getting maxed out. <strong>Web perf is hard</strong> and
there are many possible causes for performance issues. For that reason, it’s
useful to get an initial view at 50,000 ft. so that you can appropriately narrow
the scope of your debugging efforts.</p>
<p>The Performance Monitor drawer pane allows us to easily see some high level
runtime performance metrics like CPU usage, JS Heap Allocations and more.</p>
<p>Again the the easiest way to bring up the performance monitor is via the
Commmand Menu. Open it and type “Show Performance Monitor” and hit Enter. You
should now see a new Drawer pane tracking key perf metrics over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/performance-monitor.png" alt="Performance Monitor" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>leverage <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/devtools-release-notes#throttling">cpu throttling</a>
to see how your site performs on less powerful devices.</p>
<h3>Script Blackboxing</h3>
<p>More often that not, when working with the JS debugger you are more interested
in your own application code rather than any 3rd party code that is being
executed.</p>
<p><em>Script Blackboxing</em> is way to ignore specific files while debugging. When a
script is blackboxed, it won’t appear in the Call Stack pane and even better,
when stepping through code, the blackboxed scripts will be skipped.</p>
<p>The best way to blackbox scripts is via the Settings pane. Open DevTools and
click the cog on the far right to open the settings and select “blackbox”. Here
you can add a pattern to blackbox any scripts you wish to ignore when debugging!</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/script-blackboxing.png" alt="Script Blackboxing" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3>Local Overrides</h3>
<p>Local overrides are a way to persist changes you make to your code via
DevTools and have them persist across page reloads. This feature is particularly
handy when collaborating with designers to make UI tweaks on the fly.</p>
<p>To enable local overrides, open the DevTools and select the Sources tab. Select
Overrides from the sub menu and click “Select folder for overrides” to choose a
directory where DevTools can persist your changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/overrides.png" alt="Overrides" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>With overrides enabled, DevTools will now serve any local modified files rather
than the original resources.</p>
<p>Give it a shot. Change a CSS property via the Styles sub-menu of the Elements pane
and refresh the page. You should see your change persist across page reloads.</p>
<p>Chrome also gives you a way to easily track these changes. Open the Command Menu
and search for “Changes” hit enter on the “Show Changes” Drawer menu item.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/changes.png" alt="Overrides" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Hopefully some of these DevTool features are new to you. If so I encourage you
to try incorporating them in to your day to day development workflow. It will
take time to build some new muscle memories but sometimes you gotta go slow
to go fast!</p>

  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

<p>By visualizing the hidden state between a model's layers, we can get some clues as to the model's "thought process".</p>

            After a language model generates a sentence, we can visualize a view of how the model came by each word (column).  Each row is a model layer. The value and color indicate the ranking of the output token at that layer. The darker the color, the higher the ranking. Layer 0 is at the top. Layer 47 is at the bottom.<br>

<p>Part 2: Continuing the pursuit of making Transformer language models more transparent, this article showcases a collection of visualizations to uncover mechanics of language generation inside a pre-trained language model. These visualizations are all created using <a href="https://www.eccox.io/">Ecco</a>, the open-source package we're releasing

</p><p>In the first part of this series, <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/explaining-transformers/">Interfaces for Explaining Transformer Language Models</a>, we showcased interactive interfaces for input saliency and neuron activations. In this article, we will focus on the hidden state as it evolves from model layer to the next. By looking at the hidden states produced by every transformer decoder block, we aim to gleam information about how a language model arrived at a specific output token. This method is explored by Voita et al.<cite key="voita2019bottom"></cite>. Nostalgebraist <cite key="nostalgebraist2020"></cite>
        presents compelling visual treatments showcasing the evolution of token rankings, logit scores, and softmax
        probabilities for the evolving hidden state through the various layers of the model.

<h2>Recap: Transformer Hidden States</h2>
<p>The following figure recaps how a transformer language model works. How the layers result in a final hidden state. And how that final state is then projected to the output vocabulary which results in a score assigned to each token in
        the model's vocabulary. We can see here the top scoring tokens when DistilGPT2 is fed the input sequence " 1, 1,
        ":</p>
<figure>
        <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/transformer-language-model-steps.png">
        <figcaption>
            <strong>Figure: Recap of transformer language models.</strong><br>
            This figure shows how the model arrives at the top five output token candidates and their probability scores. This shows us that at the final layer, the
            model is 59% sure the next token is ' 1', and that would be chosen as the output token by greedy decoding.
            Other probable outputs include ' 2' with 18% probability (maybe we are counting) and ' 0' with 5%
            probability (maybe we are counting down).
        </figcaption>
    </figure><p>

Ecco provides a view of the model's top scoring tokens and their probability scores.

Which would show the following breakdown of candidate output tokens and their probability scores:

            <strong>Figure: Ten tokens with highest probabilities at the final layer of the model.</strong><br>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<h2>Scores after each layer</h2>
<p>Applying the same projection to internal hidden states of the model gives us a view of how the model's conviction
        for the output scoring developed over the processing of the inputs. This projection of internal hidden states
        gives us a sense of which layer contributed the most to elevating the scores (and hence ranking) of a certain
        potential output token.</p>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Viewing the evolution of the hidden states means that instead of looking only at the candidates output tokens from
        projecting the final model state, we can look at the top scoring tokens after projecting the hidden state
        resulting from each of the model's six layers.</p><p>


This visualization is created using the same method above with omitting the 'layer' argument (which we set to the final layer in the previous example, layer #5):

</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>layer_predictions</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>6</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure><p>


Resulting in: 

</p><figure>
        <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/predictions%20all%20layers.PNG">
        <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure: Top scoring tokens after each of the model's six layers.</strong>
        <br>
            Each row shows the top ten predicted tokens obtained by projecting each hidden state to the output
            vocabulary. The probability scores are shown in pink (obtained by passing logit scores through softmax). We
            can see that <strong>Layer 0</strong> has no digits in its top ten predictions. <strong>Layer 1</strong>
            gives the token ' 1' a 0.03%, probability which, while low, still ranks the token as the seventh highest
            ranking token. Subsequent layers keep elevating the probability and ranking of ' 1', until <strong>the final
            layer</strong> injects a bit more caution by reducing the probability from 100% to ~60%, still retaining the
            token as the highest ranked in the model's output.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This figure is incorrect in showing 0 probability assigned to some tokens due to rounding. The current version of Ecco fixes this by showing '&lt;0.01%'.

You can experiment with these visualizations and experiment with them on your own input sentences at the following colab link:

</p><p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Output_Token_Scores.ipynb"><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/colab-badge.svg"></a>
    </p>

<h3>Evolution of the selected token</h3>
<figure>
        <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/logit_ranking_1.png">
        <figcaption>
            <strong>The ranking of the token ' 1' after each layer</strong><br>
            <strong>Layer 0</strong> elevated the token ' 1' to be the 31st highest scored token in the hidden state it
            produced. <strong>Layers 1 and 2</strong> kept increasing the ranking (to 7 then 5 respectively). All the
            <strong>following layers</strong> were sure this is the best token and gave it the top ranking spot.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Another visual perspective on the evolving hidden states is to re-examine the hidden states after selecting an output
        token to see how the hidden state after each layer ranked that token. This is one of the many perspectives
        explored by Nostalgebraist <cite key="nostalgebraist2020"></cite>
        and the one we think is a great first approach. In the figure on the side, we can see the ranking (out of
        +50,0000 tokens in the model's vocabulary) of the token ' 1' where each row
        indicates a layer's output.
    </p>

<p>The same visualization can then be plotted for an entire generated sequence, where each column indicates a
        generation step (and its output token), and each row the ranking of
        the output token at each layer:
    </p>

<figure>
        <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/sequence_111_rankings.PNG">
        <figcaption>
            <strong>Evolution of the rankings of the output sequence ' 1 , 1'</strong><br>
            We can see that <strong>Layer 3</strong> is the point at which the model started to be certain of
            the digit ' 1' as the output. <br><strong>When the output is to be a comma</strong>, Layer 0 usually ranks
            the comma as 5. <br>
            <strong>When the output is to be a ' 1'</strong>, Layer 0 is less certain, but still ranks the ' 1' token at
            31 or 32.
            Notice that every output token is ranked #1 after Layer 5. That is the definition of <strong>greedy
            sampling</strong> -- the reason we selected this token is because it was ranked first.
        </figcaption>

<p>Let us demonstrate this visualization by presenting the following input to GPT2-Large:</p>

<p>Visualizaing the evolution of the hidden states sheds light on how various layers contribute to generating this sequence as we can see in the following figure:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Columns of solid pink corresponding to newlines and periods. Starting from Layer #0 and onwards, the model is certain early on of these tokens, indicating Layer #0's awareness of certain syntactic properties (and that later layers raise no objections).</li>
                <li>
                    Columns where country names are predicted are very bright at the top and it's up to the last five layers to really come up with the appropriate token.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Columns tracking the incrementing number tend to be resolved at layer #9.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The model erroneously lists Chile in the list, not a EU country. But notice that the ranking of that token is 43 -- indicating the error is better attributed to our token sampling method rather than to the model itself. In the case of all other countries they were correct and in the top 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aside from Chile, the rest of the countries are correct, but also follow the alphabetical order followed in the input sequence.

            While the final output succeeds in assigning the correct number, the first five layers surprisingly fail at

 <p>One such case is the number prediction task described by Linzen et al.<cite key="linzen2016assessing"></cite>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Alerting is part of every monitoring solution, but have you ever looked at alerts as time series? By doing so an ocean of opportunities opens.</p><article>
      
<p>If you have ever set up a system for monitoring another system, you know comes a time when you can no longer stare at dashboards to ensure your system is behaving properly. <strong>That time is when you need to set up alerting so you can wake up your teammates in the middle of the night.</strong></p>



<p>Alerts come in different shapes, colors, and sizes. At SenX we strongly believe alerts are nothing more than time series with a notification mechanism to alter your sleep pattern. This post will walk you through alerts as we implement them on top of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> to provide notifications about anomalies on industrial equipment or on IT infrastructure.</p>



<h2>Alerts as Time Series</h2>



<p>When you see the world as time series as we do, alerts appear as simple series of boolean values, with <code>true</code> meaning that the alerting condition is met and <code>false</code> or the absence of value that it is not. The meaning and complexity of the underlying condition are very flexible. It could be a simple threshold that is passed, a diversion from a previous trend, a detected anomaly, or any other thing you might think of.</p>



<p><strong>Treating alerts as time series means to periodically assess those conditions and, depending on the outcome, to insert boolean values in a set of time series.</strong> Those series will accrue values and give you a very good understanding of your systems.</p>

<p>The example above shows alert series related to a subsystem of a complex infrastructure over a period of several months.</p>



<h4>By just looking at those series you can see some very interesting things:</h4>



<p>At <strong>(1)</strong> you can see that many alerts are triggered at the same time. This means that some events impacted multiple systems, in the present case, network outages which caused several services to fail.</p>



<p>Then at <strong>(2)</strong> we see sporadic alerts, single values here and there, meaning that a condition was evaluated to <code>true</code> in an isolated manner. Most of the time these lonely alerts are due to metrics which arrive late and therefore lead to a condition evaluation based on data which does not reflect reality. If this type of alerts repeats itself too often it might be time to tune your metric collection system.</p>



<p>At <strong>(3)</strong> we see a high density of alerts, this happens when the root cause of the alerts is not dealt with rapidly, the condition keeps on evaluate to <code>true</code> and therefore values keep being added to the alert time series. If you see too many of those you might need to talk to your on-call team. They are not acting fast enough or the issues they faces were complex to resolve.</p>



<p>Finally, at <strong>(4)</strong>, you see three alerts which are triggered almost always at the same time, this either means that some of them are not useful or that a component has an impact on several, a little like in case<strong> (1)</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Another benefit of treating alerts as time series is that you can easily test out new alerting conditions by running the condition on past metrics values and see how often alerts would be triggered.</strong> You could then assess if the new condition would have generated more or less alerts than the current one, and you could see if known incidents could have been detected earlier or not.</p>



<p><strong>You see, by treating alerts as time series you can learn a lot about the systems you supervise, and believe it or not, no notification was involved.</strong></p>



<h2>Alerts and notifications are two different beasts</h2>



<p>This is probably not what you thought up to now, but once you think about alerts as time series, notifications are simply here to warn you about the current situation, they are not the alerts themselves. <strong>So it is very important that when you design your supervision stack you clearly separate the notification step from the condition assessments which will lead to values in the alert time series.</strong></p>



<p>If notifications and alert conditions are too much entangled, you will have a hard time setting up efficient alerts. You will reason about the messenger (the email, page, or phone call you receive in the middle of the night) and not about the message itself.</p>



<p>Notifications should have a flexibility of their own, meaning that different target groups should decide to receive notifications, based on differing interpretations of the alert time series. Some teams might want to get paged when alerts outside their direct concern become too dense because they might indicate a worsening situation which may need their intervention, and ultimately may require they add new alerts themselves.</p>



<h2>Alerts in Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>We have been using Warp&nbsp;10 for alerting for a long time. As a matter of fact, we monitor our own WarpCloud hosted platform using other instances of Warp&nbsp;10. And alerting and notifications are entirely handled in WarpScript. </p>



<p>So we will focus in the rest of this article on the alerting part done in Warp&nbsp;10. </p>



<p>For notifications, we will cover how to leverage external tools. The notification mechanisms available in Warp&nbsp;10 itself will be covered in another post.</p>



<h3>Configuration</h3>



<p>Over the years we have crafted macros which help us create and manage alerts. Those macros are now Open Source (AGPL) and available on SenX' <a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpFleet</a> repository. This repository is configured by default in <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-release-2-7-0-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Warp&nbsp;10 installs</a> so you most probably won't have to add it.</p>



<p>In order for these macros to operate properly, they need to have access to a write and a read token. Those tokens should be <a href="https://blog.senx.io/thinking-in-warpscript-protecting-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defined in your configuration</a> under the following keys:</p>



<pre><code>alerting-write-token@senx/alerting = YOUR_WRITE_TOKEN
alerting-read-token@senx/alerting = YOUR_READ_TOKEN</code></pre>



<p>Once those configs have been added, restart your Warp&nbsp;10 instance. It will then be ready to use the alerting macros, and you can run the examples which appear in the rest of this post.</p>



<h3>How are alerts stored?</h3>



<p>The alerting macros will use the tokens provided in the configuration to store and read Geo Time Series (GTS) containing the alerts.</p>



<p>They manage two sets of GTS, the first one is <em>alerts</em> GTS which use <code>alert</code> as their class name. These series contain boolean values, actually, mainly <code>true</code> values, indicating whether an alert condition is met or not. The second set of series contains <em>events</em> series which keep track of the actions performed by the alerting macros. These series use the <code>alert.events</code> class name. Both sets of series use labels to identify alerts. </p>



<p>Those labels should contain elements which add context about the systems subject of the alerts (device id, rack, engine number, data center, ...) but not to the actual alert beyond its name. </p>



<p>For example, if you are triggering an alert because the equipment is experiencing extreme vibrations, you should not include the precise level of vibration in the labels. There are some macros to add that type of context to an alert.</p>



<h3>Triggering an alert</h3>



<p>You collect data points in various series which represent the state of systems you supervise, whether industrial or IT. Periodically you run macros which perform computations on those series to check various conditions. When a specific condition is met, you want to trigger an alert named <code>cond.1</code> to record this fact.</p>



<p>In your script, you would call the macro <code>@senx/alerting/trigger</code> with a map containing the labels you want to attach to the alert. Remember, those labels will end up as the labels of the series tracking the condition. </p>



<p>In the following example, we set three labels, <code>name</code> with the name of the alert, <code>equipment</code> with the id of the equipment experiencing this condition and <code>factory</code> with the reference of the factory where the equipment is located. These latter two information were probably retrieved from the labels of the series on which the computation was performed. The code to trigger the alert would then be:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'name' 'cond.1'
  'factory' 'factory.A'
  'equipment' '12B27-3'
} @senx/alerting/trigger</code></pre>



<p>That is all there is to it. This will create an entry in the series <code>alert.events{name=cond.1,factory=factory.A,equipment=12B27-3}</code> indicating a <code>TRIGGER</code> action was performed, and a <code>true</code> value will appear in series <code>alert{name=cond.1,factory=factory.A,equipment=12B27-3}</code>, both at the same current timestamp.</p>



<h3>Retrieving alerts</h3>



<p>The alerts created via <code>@senx/alerting/trigger</code> can be retrieved either via a regular <code><a href="https://warp10.io/doc/FETCH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FETCH</a></code> call with the appropriate token or more directly via the macro @senx/alerting/fetch. This macro expects a map of labels, an end timestamp, and a duration.</p>



<p>To retrieve all alerts related to<code> factory.A</code> during the last 24  hours simply execute the following:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'factory' 'factory.A'
}
NOW
24 h
@senx/alerting/fetch</code></pre>



<p>This will retrieve the data points of the last 24 hours for both the <code>alert</code> and <code>alert.events</code> series with label <code>factory</code> set to <code>factory.A</code>.</p>



<h3>Splitting alerts</h3>



<p>When alerts are triggered, it is rare that only a single value gets written to the <code>alert</code> series. Usually, the condition triggering the alert is met during several consecutive time intervals at which it is computed.</p>



<p>This leads to <em>blocks</em> of <code>true</code> values in the <code>alert</code> Geo Time Series, each block can be considered a separate occurrence of the actual alert, and it is therefore, useful to be able to isolate each of those occurrences.</p>



<p>This is done quite easily in WarpScript using the <code><a href="https://warp10.io/doc/TIMESPLIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIMESPLIT</a></code> function which will split a GTS in multiple sub GTS based on <em>quiet</em> periods where no values exist in the GTS. So for example, if you consider that blocks of values separated by more than 30 minutes are separate occurrences of the alert, you can use the following WarpScript code to isolate each occurrence:</p>



<pre><code>// We consider 'alert' series to be in variable $alerts
$alerts
30 m   // Consider 30 minute quiet periods
2      // Consider blocks with at least 2 values
'occ'  // Add a label 'occ' with the sequence number of each block
TIMESPLIT</code></pre>



<p>The result will be a list of lists, one for each alert, containing one Geo Time Series per occurrence of each alert.</p>

    <div>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those
changes</a> have now been merged, so I figured I’d write another <a href="https://defn.io/2020/01/05/racket-on-ios/">one
of these guides</a> while the information is still fresh in my head.</p>
<h2 id="compile-racket-for-macos-and-for-ios">Compile Racket for macOS and for iOS</h2>
<p>You need a recent version of Racket and it’s associated fork of Chez
Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-xcode-project">Set up your XCode project</h2>
<p>To link against and use Racket CS within an XCode project, copy
<code>racketcs.h</code>, <code>racketcsboot.h</code> and <code>chezscheme.h</code> from
<code>racket-ios/include/</code> into a sub-directory of your project, then add
that sub-directory to the “Header Search Paths” section under your
project’s “Build Settings” tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-headers.png" alt="Headers"></p>
<p>Then, disable Bitcode from the same section.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-bitcode.png" alt="Bitcode"></p>
<p>Next, copy <code>libracketcs.a</code>, <code>petite.boot</code>, <code>scheme.boot</code> and
<code>racket.boot</code> from <code>racket-ios/lib</code> into a sub-directory of your
project called <code>vendor/</code> and drag-and-drop the <code>vendor/</code> directory
into your XCode project.  Then, instruct XCode to link <code>libracketcs.a</code>
and <code>libiconv.tbd</code> with your code from the “Build Phases” tab.  You’ll
have to add <code>libracketcs.a</code> to your project using the “Add Other…”
sub-menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-link.png" alt="Link"></p>
<p>Next, add a new C source file called <code>vendor.c</code> and answer “yes” if
prompted to create a bridging header for Swift.  I tend to re-name the
bridging header to plain <code>bridge.h</code> because I don’t like the name that
XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.
From <code>bridge.h</code>, include <code>vendor.h</code> and inside <code>vendor.h</code> add
definitions for <code>racket_init</code> and <code>echo</code></p>

				<p><strong>Update</strong> (June 21): this article has been published at <a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/195.php">embeddedrelated.com</a>, where I hope to publish a follow-up soon.</p>
<p>Today, pretty much everyone has a CPU, a DSP and a GPU, buried somewhere in their PC, phone, car, etc. Most don't know or care that they bought any of these, but they did.</p>
<p>Will everyone, at some future point, also buy an FPGA? The market size of FPGAs today is about 1% of the annual global semiconductor sales (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array#Market_size">~$3B</a> vs <a href="http://www.semiconductors.org/news/2012/06/05/global-sales-report-2012/global-semiconductor-sales-grow-at-fastest-rate-in-almost-two-years-on-sequential-monthly-basis-top-24-billion-for-first-time-in-2012/">~$300B</a>). Will FPGA eventually become a must-have, or will its volume remain relatively low?</p>
<p>We'll try to answer this question below. In order to see how popular FPGAs could become, we'll need to discuss what FPGAs are. FPGAs are a programmable platform, but one designed by EEs for EEs rather than for programmers. So for many programmers, FPGAs are exciting yet mysterious; I hope our discussion will help demystify them.</p>
<p>We'll start with a common explanation of FPGAs' relatively low popularity. We'll see why that explanation is wrong – and why, if we take a closer look, we actually come to expect FPGAs to blow the competition out of the water!</p>
<p>This will conclude today's installment, "Why you'll buy an FPGA". A sequel is in the making, titled "Why you <em>won't</em> buy an FPGA". There, we'll see some of the major obstacles standing between FPGAs and world domination.</p>
<p><strong>The oft-repeated wrong answer</strong></p>
<p>…to the question of "why aren't FPGAs more popular?" is, "FPGA is a poor man's alternative to making chips. You can implement any circuit design in an FPGA, but less efficiently than you could in an ASIC or a custom design. So it's great for prototyping, and for low-volume products where you can't afford to make your own chips. But it makes no sense for the highest-volume devices – which happen to add up to 99% of sales, leaving 1% to FPGAs."</p>
<p>This is wrong because programmability is a feature, not just a tax on efficiency.</p>
<p>Of course a Verilog program doing convolution on an FPGA would run faster if you made a chip that runs just that program. But you typically don't want to do this, even for the highest-volume products, any more than you want to convert your C programs running on CPUs into dedicated hardware! Because you want to change your code, run other programs, etc. etc.</p>
<p>When programmability is required – which is extremely often – then the right thing to compare FPGAs to is another programmable platform: a DSP, a GPU, etc. And, just like FPGAs, all of these necessarily introduce some overhead for programmability. So we can no longer assume, a priori, that any one option is more efficient than another – as we did when comparing FPGAs to single-purpose ASICs.</p>
<p>We need benchmarks – and FPGAs' performance appears very competitive in some benchmarks. Here's what <a href="http://www.bdti.com/InsideDSP/2007/03/06/Bdti">BDTI's report</a> from 2007 says:</p>
<blockquote><p>…we estimated that high-end FPGAs implementing demanding DSP  applications … consume on the order of 10 watts, while high-end DSPs consume  roughly 2-3 watts. Our benchmark results have shown that high-end FPGAs  can support roughly <strong>10 to 100 times</strong> more channels on this benchmark than  high-end DSPs…</p></blockquote>
<p>So for that benchmark, FPGAs offer 10x-100x the runtime performance, and 2x-30x the energy efficiency of DSPs – quite impressive!</p>
<p>But wait – how are they so efficient?</p>
<p><strong>FPGAs are no longer FPGAs<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Aren't FPGAs Field-Programmable Gate Arrays?</p>
<p>Programmable gate arrays can't multiply as efficiently as dedicated multipliers, can they? A dedicated multiplier is a bunch of gates connected with wires – the <em>specific</em> gates that you need for multiplying, connected <em>specifically </em>to the right other gates as required for multiplication.</p>
<p>A programmable gate array is when your gates are <em>generic</em>. They index into a truth table (called a look-up table or LUT) with their inputs, and fetch the answer. With a 2-input LUT, you get an OR gate or an AND gate or whatever, depending on the truth table you programmed. With 3-input LUTs, you can have a single gate computing, say, (a&amp;b)|c, but the principle is the same:</p>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/lut3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This absolutely must be bigger and slower than just an OR gate or an AND gate!</p>
<p>Likewise, wires go through programmable switch boxes, which connect wires as instructed by programmable bits:</p>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/routing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are several switch box topologies determining which wires can be connected to which. But whatever the topology, this must be bigger and slower than wires going directly to the right gates.</p>
<p>All this is indeed true, and a "bare" FPGA having nothing but programmable gates and routers cannot compete with a DSP. However, today's FPGAs come with <em>DSP slices</em> – specialized hardware blocks placed amidst the gates and routers, which do things like multiply-accumulate in "hard", dedicated gates.</p>
<p>So <em>that's</em> how FPGAs compete with DSPs – they have DSP hardware in them! <em>Cheating, </em>isn't it?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>It's "cheating" in the sense that FPGAs aren't really FPGAs any more – instead, they're arrays of programmable gates <em>plus all that other stuff</em>. A "true FPGA" would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/fpga-clean.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, a high-end modern FPGA looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/fpga-real.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To be competitive in DSP applications, FPGAs need DSP slices – ALUs doing things like multiply-accumulates.</p>
<p>To be competitive in applications needing a CPU – which is most of them – today's FPGAs have more than just specialized ALUs. They have full-blown ARM cores  implemented using "hard", non-programmable gates!</p>
<p>So you've been "cheated" if you thought of FPGAs as "clean slates" suitable for any design. In reality, FPGAs have specialized hardware to make them competitive in specific areas.</p>
<p>And you can sometimes guess where they're less competitive by observing which specializations they lack. For instance, there are no "GPU slices", and indeed I don't believe FPGAs can compete with GPUs in their own domain as they compete with DSPs. (Why not simply add GPU slices then? Here the plot thickens, as we'll see in the follow-up article.)</p>
<p>But of course having DSP slices is more than just "cheating" – because look at just how many DSP slices FPGAs have. The cheapest FPGAs can do <strong>hundreds</strong> of mutliply-accumulates simultaneously! (My drawing above has the wrong scale – imagine hundreds of small DSP slices near a couple of much larger CPUs.)</p>
<p>And hundreds of MACs is a big deal, because while anyone can cram a load of multipliers into a chip, the hard part is to connect it all together, letting a meaningful program actually <em>use </em>these multipliers in parallel.</p>
<p>For instance, TI's C64 DSPs can do 8 MACs per cycle – but only if it's a dot product. TI's C66 DSPs can do 32 MACs/cycle – but only if you're multiplying complex numbers. You only get the highest throughput for very specific data flows.</p>
<p>To the extent that the FPGA architecture lets you actually use an order of magnitude more resources at a time, and do that in more real-life examples, it is a rather unique achievement. And this is how they actually <em>beat </em>dedicated DSPs with their DSP slices, not just reach the same performance.</p>
<p><strong>FPGA as a programmable accelerator architecture</strong></p>
<p>So what makes FPGAs such an efficient architecture? There's no simple answer, but here are some things that FPGAs can use to their advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No need for full-blown ALUs for simple operations</strong>: a 2-bit adder doesn't need to be mapped to a large, "hard" DSP slice – it can fit comfortably in a small piece of "soft" logic. With most processors, you'd "burn" a full-blown ALU to do the simplest thing.</li>
<li><strong>No need for a full <em>cycle</em> for simple operations</strong>: on FPGAs, you don't have to sacrifice a full cycle to do a simple operation, like an OR, which has a delay much shorter than a full cycle. Instead, you can feed OR's output immediately to the next operation, say, AND, without going through registers. You can chain quite a few of these, as long as their delays add up to less than a cycle. With most processors, you'd end up "burning" a full cycle on each of these operations.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed operand routing</strong>: most processors have their ALUs communicate through register files. With all the ALUs connected to all the registers, there's a bottleneck – this interconnect grows as the product of the number of ALUs and registers, so you can't have too many of either. FPGAs spread ALUs and registers throughout the chip, and you can connect them in ways not creating such bottlenecks – say, as a long chain, as a tree, and in many other ways. Of course you can also route everything through a bottleneck, and then your design will run at a low frequency – but you don't have to. With CPUs or DSPs, they run at a high frequency – because the amount of ALUs and registers was limited to make that frequency possible. But in FPGAs you can get <em>both </em>high frequencies and a lot of resources used in parallel.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed command dispatching</strong>: a 2-issue or a 6-issue processor is common, but 100-issue processors are virtually unheard of. Partly it's because of the above-mentioned operand routing, and partly it's because of command dispatching – you'd have to fetch all those commands from memory, another bottleneck. In FPGAs, you can implement command-generating logic in simple state machines residing near your ALUs – and in the simplest case, commands are constants kept in registers residing near ALUs. This lets you easily issue 100 parallel instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This "distributed" business is easier to appreciate by looking at an example. Here's a schematic implementation of a 1D convolution on an FPGA – you convolve a long vector v with an N-coefficient filter f, computing, at every i, f0*v[i] + f1*v[i-1] + f2*v[i-2] + … + fN-1*v[i-N-1]:</p>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/fpga-tree.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this drawing, N=8, but it scales easily to arbitrary N, producing results at a slightly larger latency – the summation tree depth being log(N).</p>
<p>The orange boxes are registers; commands like + and * are stored in registers, as are inputs and outputs. (I'm feeding the output of * to + directly without going through a register to save screen space.) Every clock cycle, inputs are fed to ALUs, and the outputs become the new register values.</p>
<p>Orange boxes (registers) spread amongst green boxes (ALUs) illustrate "distributed …</p></div></div>

  <p>
    Linux being secure is a common misconception in the security and privacy realm. Linux is thought to be secure primarily
    because of its source model, popular usage in servers, small userbase and confusion about its security features. This
    article is intended to debunk these misunderstandings. Due to inevitable pedanticism, "Linux" in this article refers
    to a standard desktop Linux or GNU/Linux distribution.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">Sandboxing</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    There is no strong sandboxing in the standard Linux desktop. This means that all applications have access to each other’s data
    and can snoop on your personal information. Linux still follows the <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/08/ms-dos-security-model.html">MS-DOS security model</a> — any malicious
    application you install or an RCE vulnerability in a benevolent application can result in the attacker instantly gaining
    access to your data. </p><p>
    
    This is in contrast to other desktop operating systems such as macOS or Windows 10 which have already put considerable effort into
    sandboxing applications. macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox">requires that all applications
    are sandboxed</a>. Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/intro-to-secure-windows-app-development#41-windows-app-model">
    automatically sandboxes UWP applications</a> and provides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox
    utility</a> for non-UWP applications.
  </p></div>

  <h3 id="flatpak"><a href="#flatpak">Flatpak</a></h3>

  <div><p>
    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications, but <a href="https://flatkill.org/">its sandboxing is very flawed</a>. It fully
    trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can
    just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed. </p><p>
    
    Flatpak's permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with
    <code>filesystem=home</code> which is read-write access to the user's home directory, giving access to all of your
    personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or similar. </p><p>
    
    Another example of Flatpak's broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy
    escapes due to X11's lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but
    <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/02/17/first-fully-sandboxed-linux-desktop-app/">Flatpak developers refuse
    to acknowledge this and continue to claim, "X11 is impossible to secure"</a>. </p><p>
    
    Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as <code>/sys</code> or
    <code>/proc</code> (kernel interfaces known for information leaks). </p><p>
    
    <i>Another</i> example is how the seccomp filter <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/f687f6b2ebfe9bc69f59e42bb96475ca01f08548/common/flatpak-run.c#L2646-L2693">
    only blacklists ~20 syscalls</a> which still exposes significant kernel attack surface.
  </p></div>

  <h3 id="firejail"><a href="#firejail">Firejail</a></h3>

  <p>
    Firejail also aims to sandbox applications but is, again, uneffective. If anything, it worsens security by acting as a
    privilege escalation hole. Firejail requires being SUID root, meaning it executes with the privileges of the root user.
    This could be acceptable if Firejail followed good security practices but, unfortunately, they do not. Firejail has too
    large attack surface which has resulted in <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/25">many</a> <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=16191&amp;product_id=0&amp;version_id=0&amp;page=1">vulnerabilities</a>
    in the past. <a href="https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/3046">There are more details in this thread</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="exploit-mitigations"><a href="#exploit-mitigations">Exploit Mitigations</a></h2>

  

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a> is an exploit mitigation that aims to prevent
      code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP. A large portion of vulnerabilities are exploited using these techniques due to mitigations like NX
      making older techniques obsolete. On Linux, CFI is practically non-existent outside of Chromium whereas
      Windows has their own coarse-grained, forward-edge CFI implementation, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a> (CFG) as well as <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815">
      Intel CET shadow stacks for backward-edge protection</a>. While CFG is only coarse-grained, Microsoft are <a href="https://connormcgarr.github.io/examining-xfg/">working on making it more fine-grained</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      A very basic exploit technique is simply to find a way to execute the attackers own malicious code either by loading
      a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory. Linux has yet to provide strong mitigations
      against this while Windows has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">
      Arbitrary Code Guard and Code Integrity Guard</a> to enforce strict W^X and mitigate this avenue of attacks. SELinux does provide
      the <code>execmem</code> boolean, however this is rarely ever used. There is also the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/">S.A.R.A. LSM</a> but this is yet to
      be accepted upstream.
    </li>

    <li>
      One of the most common memory corruption vulnerabilities is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable">
      uninitialized memory</a>. Windows <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/05/13/solving-uninitialized-stack-memory-on-windows/">
      uses InitAll</a> to automatically initialize stack variables to zero for the kernel and some user space code as well as <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/07/02/solving-uninitialized-kernel-pool-memory-on-windows/">safer APIs for the kernel pool</a>
      whereas the solution in Linux is... nothing. There are some mitigations for kernel memory specifically but this doesn't cover
      any user space code and good luck finding a mainstream distribution that actually enables them.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">Kernel</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel, meaning it contains a colossal amount of code all within
    the most privileged part of the operating system. The kernel has huge attack surface and is constantly adding new and dangerous features.
    The Linux kernel is equivalent to running all user space code as root in PID 1. </p><p>
    
    One example of these features is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">eBPF</a>. In a nutshell, eBPF is a framework within the
    Linux kernel that allows <i>unprivileged</i> user space to execute arbitrary code within the kernel for increased performance. eBPF
    also includes a JIT compiler which is fundamentally a W^X violation and opens up the possibility of JIT spraying. The kernel does perform
    a number of checks on the code that is executed but even then, this feature <a href="https://ricklarabee.blogspot.com/2018/07/ebpf-and-analysis-of-get-rekt-linux.html">has</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/spendergrsec/status/1244703091037024257">still</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/bleidl/status/943714277403357185">caused</a> <a href="https://scannell.me/fuzzing-for-ebpf-jit-bugs-in-the-linux-kernel/">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification">security</a>
    <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-ebpf.c">vulnerabilities</a>. </p><p>
    
    Another example of these features is <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user namespaces</a>.
    User namespaces allow unprivileged users to interact with lots of kernel code that is normally reserved for the root user. It adds a
    massive amount of networking, mount, etc. functionality as new attack surface. It has also been the cause of <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043066.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043078.html">privilege</a> <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check#questions-and-answers">escalation</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/subgraph/oz/issues/11#issuecomment-163396758">vulnerabilities</a> which is why many distributions <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/patches/debian/add-sysctl-to-disallow-unprivileged-CLONE_NEWUSER-by-default.patch">
    such as Debian</a> have started to restrict it by default. The endless stream of vulnerabilities
    arising from this feature shows no sign of stopping either even after years since its introduction. </p><p>
    
    The kernel is written entirely in a memory unsafe language and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities, <a href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf">discovered
    each <i>month</i></a>. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers can’t keep up which
    results in many of the bugs <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">staying unfixed for a long time</a>.
    <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/files/syscan12-exploitinglinux.pdf">The kernel is decades behind in exploit
    mitigations</a> and many kernel developers simply <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/">do not
    care enough</a>. </p><p>
    
    Other kernels such as the  Windows and macOS kernels are somewhat similar too in that they are also large and bloated monolithic kernels with huge
    attack surface but they at least realise that these issues exist and take further steps to mitigate them.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="root"><a href="#root">The Non-Existent Boundary of Root</a></h2>

  <p>
    On ordinary desktops, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation">a compromised non-root user account with access
    to <code>sudo</code> is almost equal to full root compromise</a> as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the
    sudo password. Usually, the standard user is part of group <code>sudo</code> which makes this a massive issue and makes a
    sudo password security theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">Xorg’s lack of GUI
      isolation</a>, the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3">many infoleaks in
      <code>/proc</code></a>, using <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hook
      into every process</a> and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can
    just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password.
  </p>

  <h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>

  <p>
    This is all it takes to get your <code>sudo</code> password:
  </p>

  <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;\EOF &gt; /tmp/sudo

if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo

  <h3 id="debian"><a href="#debian">Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS</a></h3>

  <div><p>
    Debian, among other distributions such as Ubuntu that freeze packages for a long time only ever backport security fixes
    that receive a CVE. However, this misses the majority of them. Most fixes do not receive CVEs because either the developer
    doesn’t care or because it’s not obvious whether or not a bug is exploitable at first. </p><p>
    
    Debian maintainers cannot analyze every single commit perfectly and backport every security fix. They have to rely on CVEs
    which people do not use properly. </p><p>
    
    For example, the Linux kernel is <a href="https://github.com/gregkh/presentation-cve-is-dead/blob/master/cve-linux-kernel.pdf">
    particularly</a>
    <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">bad</a> at this. Even when there is a CVE for the
    issue, sometimes fixes still aren't backported such as in the Debian Chromium package which is <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/chromium-browser-for-kicksecure-discussions-not-whonix/10388/49">still affected by many severe
    and public vulnerabilities, some of which are even being exploited in the wild</a>.

  <div><p>
    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few
    minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distributions deploy by default is also
    not going to fix this. Just because your distribution enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still
    running most processes unconfined, doesn't mean you can escape from these. </p><p>

<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>signUp</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>attrs</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>There are questions you might ask: How's the user saved? In the database? How's the user welcome? Do we send the email? Or do we, instead, send events to message queues?</p>
<p>Figuring out answers like this takes time. Sometimes surprisingly long. But it doesn't have to be. When writing code, we can <a href="https://marcel.is/clean-code-can-we-learn-from-altruism-and-evolution">help each other out</a>: search for all global variables buried in the depths of nested functions and bring the variables up to the daylight for the reader to see.</p>

<p>Now you made the function honest. All input is explicitly declared and <a href="https://marcel.is/coding-and-writing-are-alike">served on a silver platter</a> to the reader. And you made the codebase <a href="https://marcel.is/simple-components">simpler</a>. No more are the inputs scattered around, intertwined with different locations. Inputs now stand together in a single location, consistent. You also paved the way to simpler testing: no need for technical trickery and mocks of implementation details. All in all, the codebase is now <a href="https://marcel.is/sustain">easier to sustain</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/2021/01/19/linear-models-with-stheno-and-jax.html">wesselb.github.io</a>.</em></p>

<p>A linear model prescribes a linear relationship between inputs and outputs.
Linear models are amongst the simplest of models, but they are ubiquitous across science.
A linear model with Gaussian distributions on the coefficients forms one of the simplest instances of a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process">Gaussian process</a></em>.
In this post, we will give a brief introduction to linear models from a Gaussian process point of view.
We will see how a linear model can be implemented with <em>Gaussian process probabilistic programming</em> using <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/stheno">Stheno</a>, and how this model can be used to denoise noisy observations.
(Disclosure: <a href="https://willtebbutt.github.io/">Will Tebbutt</a> and Wessel are the authors of Stheno;
Will maintains a <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Julia version</a>.)
In short, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming">probabilistic programming</a> is a programming paradigm that brings powerful probabilistic models to the comfort of your programming language, which often comes with tools to automatically perform inference (make predictions).
We will also use <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a>’s just-in-time compiler to make our implementation extremely efficient.</p>

<h2 id="linear-models-from-a-gaussian-process-point-of-view">Linear Models from a Gaussian Process Point of View</h2>

<p>Consider a data set \((x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n \subseteq \R \times \R\) consisting of \(n\) real-valued input–output pairs.
Suppose that we wish to estimate a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs:</p><p>

\[\label{eq:ax_b}
    y_i = a \cdot x_i + b + \e_i,\]

</p><p>where \(a\) is an unknown slope, \(b\) is an unknown offset, and \(\e_i\) is some error/noise associated with the observation \(y_i\).
To implement this model with Gaussian process probabilistic programming, we need to cast the problem into a <em>functional form</em>.
This means that we will assume that there is some underlying, random function \(y \colon \R \to \R\) such that the observations are evaluations of this function: \(y_i = y(x_i)\).
The model for the random function \(y\) will embody the structure of the linear model \eqref{eq:ax_b}.
This may sound hard, but it is not difficult at all.
We let the random function \(y\) be of the following form:</p><p>

\[\label{eq:ax_b_functional}
    y(x) = a(x) \cdot x + b(x) + \e(x)\]

</p><p>where \(a\colon \R \to \R\) is a <em>random constant function</em>.
An example of a <em>constant function</em> \(f\) is \(f(x) = 5\).
<em>Random</em> means that the value \(5\) is not fixed, but modelled with a random value drawn from some probability distribution, because we don’t know the true value.
We let \(b\colon \R \to \R\) also be a random <em>constant function</em>, and \(\e\colon \R \to \R\) a random <em>noise function</em>.
Do you see the similarities between \eqref{eq:ax_b} and \eqref{eq:ax_b_functional}?
If all that doesn’t fully make sense, don’t worry; things should become more clear as we implement the model.</p>

<p>To model random constant functions and random noise functions, we will use <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/stheno">Stheno</a>, which is a Python library for Gaussian process modelling.
We also have a <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Julia version</a>, but in this post we’ll use the Python version.
To install Stheno, run the command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> <span>--upgrade-strategy</span> eager stheno
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Stheno, a Gaussian process can be created with <code>GP(kernel)</code>, where <code>kernel</code> is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process#Covariance_functions"><em>kernel</em> or <em>covariance function</em> of the Gaussian process</a>.
The kernel determines the properties of the function that the Gaussian process models.
For example, the kernel <code>EQ()</code> models smooth functions, and the kernel <code>Matern12()</code> models functions that look jagged.
See the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/">kernel cookbook</a> for an overview of commonly used kernels and the <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/stheno/docs/_build/html/readme.html#available-kernels">documentation of Stheno</a> for the corresponding classes.
For constant functions, you can set the kernel to simply a constant, for example <code>1</code>, which then models the constant function with a value drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\). (By default, in Stheno, all means are zero; but, if you like, <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/stheno/docs/_build/html/readme.html#available-means">you can also set a mean</a>.)</p>

<p>Let’s start out by creating a Gaussian process for the random constant function \(a(x)\) that models the slope.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>GP</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see how the Gaussian process looks by simply sampling from it.
To sample from the Gaussian process <code>a</code> at some inputs <code>x</code>, evaluate it at those inputs, <code>a(x)</code>, and call the method <code>sample</code>: <code>a(x).sample()</code>.
This shows that you can really think of a Gaussian process just like you think of a function:
pass it some inputs to get (the model for) the corresponding outputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>linspace</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>).</span><span>sample</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>));</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/linear-models-constant-functions.png" alt="Samples of a Gaussian process that models a constant function">
Figure 1: Samples of a Gaussian process that models a constant function.</p>

<p>We’ve sampled a bunch of constant functions.
Sweet!
The next step in the model \eqref{eq:ax_b_functional} is to multiply the slope function \(a(x)\) by \(x\).
To multiply <code>a</code> by \(x\), we multiply <code>a</code> by the function <code>lambda x: x</code>, which casts also \(x\) as a function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>f</span>
<span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>lambda</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give rise to functions like \(x \mapsto 0.1x\) and \(x \mapsto -0.4x\), depending on the value that \(a(x)\) takes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>).</span><span>sample</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>));</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/linear-models-slope-functions.png" alt="Samples of a Gaussian process that models functions with a random slope">
Figure 2: Samples of a Gaussian process that models functions with a random slope.</p>

<p>This is starting to look good!
The only ingredient that is missing is an offset.
We model the offset just like the slope, but here we set the kernel to <code>10</code> instead of <code>1</code>, which models the offset with a value drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 10)\).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Processes</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>lambda</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>and</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span> <span>*</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>are</span> <span>associated</span> <span>to</span> <span>different</span> <span>measures</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something went wrong.
Stheno has an abstraction called <em>measures</em>, where only <code>GP</code>s that are part of the same measure can be combined into new <code>GP</code>s;
the abstraction of measures is there to keep things safe and tidy.
What goes wrong here is that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are not part of the same measure.
Let’s explicitly create a new measure and attach <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Measure</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see how samples from <code>f</code> look like.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>).</span><span>sample</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>));</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>

Figure 3: Samples of a Gaussian process that models linear functions.</p>

<p>Perfect!
We will use <code>f</code> as our linear model.</p>

<p>In practice, observations are corrupted with noise.
We can add some noise to the lines in Figure 3 by adding a Gaussian process that models noise.
You can construct such a Gaussian process by using the kernel <code>Delta()</code>, which models the noise with independent \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\) variables.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Delta</span>

<p>That looks more realistic, but perhaps that’s a bit too much noise.
We can tune down the amount of noise, for example, by scaling <code>noise</code> by <code>0.5</code>.</p>

<p>We call a program like this a <em>Gaussian process probabilistic program</em> (GPPP).
Let’s generate some noisy synthetic data, <code>(x_obs, y_obs)</code>, that will make up an example data set \((x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n\).
We also save the observations without noise added—<code>f_obs</code>—so we can later check how good our predictions really are.</p>

Figure 6: Some observations.</p>

<p>We will see next how we can fit our model to this data.</p>

<h2 id="inference-in-linear-models">Inference in Linear Models</h2>

<p>Suppose that we wish to remove the noise from the observations in Figure 6.
We carefully phrase this problem in terms of our GPPP:
the observations <code>y_obs</code> are realisations of the <em>noisy</em> linear model <code>y</code> at <code>x_obs</code>—realisations of <code>y(x_obs)</code>—and we wish to make predictions for the <em>noiseless</em> linear model <code>f</code> at <code>x_obs</code>—predictions for <code>f(x_obs)</code>.</p>

<p>In Stheno, we can make predictions based on observations by <em>conditioning</em> the measure of the model on the observations.
In our GPPP, the measure is given by <code>prior</code>, so we aim to condition <code>prior</code> on the observations <code>y_obs</code> for <code>y(x_obs)</code>.
Mathematically, this process of incorporating information by conditioning happens through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes’ rule</a>.
Programmatically, we first make an <code>Observations</code> object, which represents the information—the observations—that we want to incorporate, and then condition <code>prior</code> on this object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Observations</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>obs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Observations</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>(</span><span>x_obs</span><span>),</span> <span>y_obs</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>prior</span><span>.</span><span>condition</span><span>(</span><span>obs</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also more concisely perform these two steps at once, as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>prior</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span><span>(</span><span>x_obs</span><span>),</span> <span>y_obs</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This mimics the mathematical notation used for conditioning.</p>

<p>With our updated measure <code>post</code>, which is often called the <em>posterior</em> measure, we can make a prediction for <code>f(x_obs)</code> by passing <code>f(x_obs)</code> to <code>post</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pred</span> <span>=</span> <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x_obs</span><span>))</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	 <p>Like most SaaS-providers we charge in USD even though we are not based in USA. MakePlans is based in Norway and NOK is the currency of choice here (along with Brent crude oil of course). While we do have some expenses in USD most of our revenue would eventually end up in our Norwegian bank account in NOK. When using Stripe for card payments they will handle currency conversion when they pay out in your local currency. While doing this they charge a <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">2% currency conversion fee</a>. That is on top of their already high fees (2,9% for foreign cards here in Norway!).</p>

<h2 id="unavailable-options">Unavailable options</h2>

<p>Turns out avoiding Stripe currency conversion fees wasn’t that easy. Here are the options we investigated:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-local-usd-account">Use a local USD account</h3>

<p>From the start we assumed this could easily be solved by having a local USD account. Most bigger banks offer USD accounts and we could easily open one. There would be some incoming transfer fees payable to the bank but a lot less than the 2% Stripe charges.</p>

<p><em>But Stripe only supports USD payouts to bank accounts in USA and Canada.</em> So while we did some research here it was pointless as such an account could not be used for payouts from Stripe.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-a-local-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with a local bank</h3>

<p>Our next research mission was to open a bank account in the USA. The easiest would be using a local bank but going into the process we were informed that it was not allowed to open what they call a personal account. Even though this would be a business account this rule comes into action when the business is majority owned by one person. As is the case with MakePlans. And that person would not sell of half of the company just to get a bank account in USA.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-an-american-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with an American bank</h3>

<p>So as a European company this leaves us one option: open a bank account in USA. While starting a US company is a lot more complicated than starting a company here in Norway (can be done in less than 30 minutes including getting a bank account) there are options for opening up a company fairly smoothly. And no reason to follow all the Google search results - Stripe actually offers a way to this. It is called <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a>. If you need a US company for other reason this seems like a good way to go. But it will mean that have all the obligations that comes with having another company and it being in USA. It will also complicate tax reporting in your company structure. So while some research was conducted here we quickly dismissed this idea and I don’t recommend it unless you need a US company for other reasons.</p>

<h2 id="enter-transferwise">Enter TransferWise</h2>

<p>I have used <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> a few times and it seems like a good option for money transfer and while I knew about their card offering I never really looked into too much as I was using Revolut when travelling to save on currency conversion fees for private usage. I guess it was around the time when Revolut launched their business offering I started looking into TransferWise Business. It got me excited but <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a> only offers a USD account in the UK, and as you already know now Stripe only supports payout in USD to accounts located in USA and Canada. TransferWise however do offer a USD account in USA. You will get a fully functional business bank account with routing and account number. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>Getting instant 2% profit is quick and easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/i/espena8">Register for a TransferWise business account</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/flows/open-balance#/">Open a USD balance in TransferWise</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the TransferWise USD bank account details in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts">Stripe dashboard ‘Payout settings’ section</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From now on all your USD charges will be paid out in USD and you will no longer pay any currency conversion fees to Stripe.</p>

<p>As a bonus you can use your shiny new TransferWise card and pay your expenses such as Heroku or Amazon directly in USD. Saving you even more in currency conversion fees as your local card usually will charge 2% as well. Double win!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Free to open account.</li>
  <li>Free debit Mastercard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transfer of $1000 USD to Norwegian bank account by converting to NOK:</p>

<![CDATA[An introduction to Morphic: Self's UI toolkit]]>

January 19, 2021 | https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In my previous two posts, I talked about Self as the language, and the system
which allows it to serialize objects into text format. Now let’s talk about
another big part of Self, which is the programming environment and the UI
toolkit that it is created from: Morphic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-morphic">What is Morphic?</h2>
<p>Morphic is an abstract UI toolkit built for Self. It has backends for X11 and
Quartz, for GNU/Linux and macOS respectively. It is based on the idea of
<em>morphs</em>, which are known as widgets in modern UI toolkits. The difference here,
obviously, is the prototypical approach; it is after all written entirely in
Self, and so employs a prototypical-inheritance programming paradigm. All morphs
have a family tree that can be traced back to the original <code>morph</code> which
provides the building blocks for implementing your own morphs.</p>
<p>Now, consider this scenario: an update to Morphic is made (this scenario is
hypothetical), and a new field is added to the root <code>morph</code> object which must
propagate to all other morphs and is needed to display the morphs. Or a simpler
scenario; you want to change a default for all morphs and you want this change
to propagate to all other morphs. However, you might remember that we previously
talked about how instances in Self work and specifically, how they work by
<em>copying a prototype</em>. So how can we easily propagate new slot information from
parents to copied children? The answer is <strong>copy-downs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="copy-downs">Copy-downs</h2>
<p>“Copy-down” is what Self calls replicating slots that exist in another object,
and updating those slots when that object changes. You may remember in the
previous post that an object had a few slots related to copy-down in its
annotation section.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self2/object_annotations.png" alt="The annotations that are available on an object."> <figcaption>
            <p>The annotations that are available on an object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the previous post we ignored these, but when programming in Morphic
copy-downs are important, so I’ll go into detail here. Copy-downs work by
sending the “copy-down selector” as a message to the “copy-down parent” (which
is an object), and then copying down the slots (except the ones listed in “slots
to omit”). This allows changes to parent objects to propagate as long as the
change is not omitted. This is similar to “sub-classing” in that it “inherits”
slots from a parent.</p>
<p>Copy-down is not a part of the Self language, but instead of the programming
environment that comes with it, and its implementation is done entirely within
annotations and the mirror system (we’ll look into mirrors later, just know that
mirrors are Self’s reflection system).</p>
<p><a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/howtoprg.html#copy-down">The handbook section about
copy-down</a>
gives some important information about copy-downs, but nothing that is really
omitted here. At the end it mentions this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least convenient aspect of using copy-downs is that to do the moral equivalent of creating a subclass, the programmer has to create two objects: a new traits object, and a new prototype, and then set the object annotation of the new prototype. Perhaps someday there will be a button to do this, or perhaps other styles of programming will emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this document is outdated, as we <em>do</em> have a way to do this in Self
now which we will take advantage of in a short bit, when we start building our
own morph. For now, let’s take a look at what a morph actually is.</p>
<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-morph">The anatomy of a morph</h2>
<p>When we get the root morph prototype by typing <code>morph</code> in the shell and then
“Get it”, we get this object:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_prototype.png" alt="The prototype morph."> <figcaption>
            <p>The prototype
<code>morph</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most of the slots here isn’t of concern to us, because they are managed
automatically by Morphic when we send it messages (either directly with an
evaluator, or by interacting with the morph directly). A few points that might
be interesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hResizing</code>/<code>vResizing</code>: These determine how the object sizes itself
according to its parent or its children. There are three modes of resizing in
Morphic, which are:
<ul>
<li>Rigid: The object stays at its defined width and height and does not change
its size based on its surroundings, parents or children.</li>
<li>Shrink-wrap: The object resizes to wrap around its contents, and does not
grow larger.</li>
<li>Flexible (or space-filling): The object enlarges to fill available space.
If multiple sibling objects have this property, they all distribute the
width/height equally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>noStickOuts</code>: Morphic optimizes drawing if the morph is a simple rectangle
with nothing sticking out of it.</li>
<li><code>velcroFlag</code>: Kind of a weirdly named one. If this is <code>true</code> then the
submorphs of this morph cannot be yanked from the morph, and you cannot
drag-and-drop new submorphs to this morph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different “subclasses” of <code>morph</code> have their own unique slots. Thankfully,
the authors of Morphic have categorized each morph’s slots such that a morph
that is copied down from another will have its unique slots under a separate
category, which makes it a lot easier to see what belongs to which morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_categories.png" alt="The frameMorph is copied down from rowMorph, which was itself copied down from morph. Each link in the chain categorizes its own slots separately."> <figcaption>
            <p>The
<code>frameMorph</code> is copied down from <code>rowMorph</code>, which was
itself copied down from <code>morph</code>. Each link in the chain categorizes
its own slots separately.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each morph may only appear once. If you use “Show Morph” on an outliner for a
morph that already exists somewhere else, it will remove itself from there and
attach it to your hand (similar to the Javascript DOM in this respect).</p>

<p>As it stands, a complex morph with many submorphs in it is hard to inspect. The
submorphs of a morph are hidden inside a <code>vector</code> called <code>rawMorphs</code> and there’s
no easy way to display a tree of what submorphs are available in a morph.
Luckily, there is a tool in the Self programming environment that allows us to
easily inspect a submorph and its parents: the <em>core sampler</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_idle.png" alt="Core sampler in
the idle state."> <figcaption>
            <p>Core sampler in
the idle state.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler will list all the morphs under its “magnifying glass” (the
crosshair), starting from the innermost one up to the outermost. Each entry in
the list allows you to see its color, and to see and modify its resizing mode.
You can also middle-click an entry to access the morph’s properties panel and
also get an outliner for the morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_list.png" alt="A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right)."> <figcaption>
            <p>A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right).</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To access the core sampler, simply right-click any existing morph and select
<code>Core sampler...</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_open.png" alt="Opening the core
sampler."> <figcaption>
            <p>Opening the core
sampler.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler is extremely helpful to figure out why a submorph is
misbehaving, because you can directly see its hierarchy and open an outliner for
it, debugging the morph as it operates. This is one of my favorite parts of
Self, because you interact with the system while it’s running, having all
debugging info at hand.</p>
<p>Now that we looked into Morphic, let’s build something with it.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-application-with-morphic">Building an application with Morphic</h2>
<p>Let’s build a desktop calculator. It’s better than a toy example (because it
actually does something) while being simple enough that this post won’t become
too long (longer than it already is, anyway). The hierarchy of the final
<code>calculatorMorph</code> is presented below.</p>
<pre><code>calculatorMorph

<p>Let’s start out by copying <code>frameMorph</code>, which provides a rectangular frame
around its contents. Open a shell with <code>New shell...</code> from the background menu,
and type in <code>frameMorph</code> then “Get it” to get the <code>frameMorph</code> prototype.</p>

<p>Earlier we talked about copy-downs and said this is how we create “sub-classes”
of morphs. We will now copy-down <code>frameMorph</code> as the basis of our
<code>calculatorMorph</code>. Middle-click <code>frameMorph</code>’s header and click <code>"Subclass" Me</code>
(this is the easy method of copying down we talked about earlier). When asked
for a copydown selector, leave it as the default and click “Okay”.</p>

<p>You can now dismiss the original <code>frameMorph</code> either with right-click &gt;
“Dismiss” or with the <code>X</code> on the top right.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basis for our calculator, we can display it! Middle-click
the header of our newly created morph, and click “Show Morph”. A little blue
square should be attached to the cursor, which we can simply drop to any empty
spot.</p>

<p>Of course, we want it to look like a part of our Morphic system, so let’s pick a
better color for it than blue<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Open the evaluator on our morph’s outliner,
and enter <code>color: paint named: 'lightGray'.</code> and then “Do it”.</p>

<code>traits morph</code> in the shell to see what functions are available. Be warned, the
<code>traits morph</code> object is quite large and it can be hard to find a specific thing
you’re looking for, but it is categorized like most other standard library
objects.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a few slots that we will be using (under a new category, so we

January 19, 2021 | https://degreesofzero.com/article/beyond-coffee-bitcoin-for-every-day-use-with-lnurl.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://degreesofzero.com/article/beyond-coffee-bitcoin-for-every-day-use-with-lnurl.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A lot of progress is being made to improve the user experience for those who would like to buy a cup of coffee with their bitcoin. For the longest time most new developments were happening in infrastructure projects such as nodes, exchanges, trading, hardware and software wallets. Now the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a> has brought the focus of many developers back to the end-user, including a resurgence in mobile wallet development with several new Lightning-first wallets.</p>
<p>In the early days a high-level of knowledge was required to use the Lightning Network. But this is no longer the case. There are already some solid, newbie-friendly wallet apps available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/">Phoenix</a> by ACINQ - easy, non-custodial</li>
<li><a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/">WalletOfSatoshi</a> - very easy, but custodial!</li>
<li><a href="https://lightning-wallet.com/">BLW (Bitcoin Lightning Wallet)</a> - non-custodial, medium complexity</li>
<li><a href="https://breez.technology/">Breez</a> - non-custodial</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the latest developments that is helping to improve the usability of the Lightning Network is <a href="https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc">LNURL</a> - a side channel communication protocol to smooth over some of the remaining UX problems. LNURL is a set of subprotocols each with a specific UX flow designed to be simple and easy to implement.</p>
<h2 id="withdrawals">Withdrawals</h2>
<p>One pain point with the Lightning Network has been the need to generate a new, unique invoice for every payment that you would like to receive and then somehow give this invoice to the service that you are using so that it can be paid. One real-world example is a web-based paywall service that accumulates satoshis via Lightning Network on your behalf. Once in a while you might want to manually withdraw your satoshis to your own wallet. To do this you would need to first generate an invoice for the exact number of satoshis and then copy/paste that invoice into your computer's browser. But if your wallet is on your phone, this can be an annoying experience.</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://degreesofzero.com/article/beyond-coffee-bitcoin-for-every-day-use-with-lnurl/images/bleskomat-in-action.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>The Bleskomat Lightning Network ATM</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Enter the lnurl-withdraw subprotocol. With a service that supports it, the end user simply scans a single QR code and the service communicates with an LNURL HTTP server to facilitate the payment process via the Lightning Network. The user doesn't need to manually generate invoices or count satoshis - their wallet and the web service can do all of that in the background.</p>
    <h3>Smooth, New Real-World Applications</h3>
    <p>This improved user experience is a perfect fit for many applications such as an <a href="https://www.bleskomat.com/">offline Lightning Network ATM</a>, simplified withdraw processes from exchange accounts, withdrawing change from a PoS terminal, and more.</p>
</div>


<h2 id="static-payment-qr-codes">Static Payment QR Codes</h2>
<div>
    <p>Another popular subprotocol is lnurl-pay. This one enables static QR codes that can be printed and re-used many times. A common example would be a printed sign that contains a QR code for donations. The lnurl-pay subprotocol allows the receiver to specify a range (min/max) for the accepted payment amounts. When the end-user (payer) scans the QR code, they are presented with a dialog that asks how much they want to pay. They choose the amount, confirm the payment in their app, and then their app communicates with an LNURL server to complete the payment via the Lightning Network.</p>
    <h3>Street Artists Beware!</h3>
    <p>Those QR-encoded donation addresses are destroying your privacy. Anyone who scans the QR code can see your address and its complete transaction history. One huge advantage to lnurl-pay QR codes is privacy. The payer's app only sees a decoded URL and min/max parameters. They won't be able to see your transaction history or how much money you've received.</p>
    
</div>



<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>Growing in popularity with bitcoin and Lightning Network developers, lnurl-auth allows service operators to provide a new method for authentication, authorization, and login.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A special linkingKey can be used to login user to a service or authorise sensitive actions. This preferrably should be done without compromising user identity so plain LN node key can not be used here. Instead of asking for user credentials a service could display a "login" QR code which contains a specialized LNURL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though part of the LNURL specification, lnurl-auth doesn't actually touch the Lightning Network. It uses your bitcoin wallet's existing seed to generate a unique signing key for each website with which you authenticate. The protocol can be used as a 2FA option or as a replacement for email/username + password login.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://degreesofzero.com/article/beyond-coffee-bitcoin-for-every-day-use-with-lnurl/images/lnurl-auth-key-tree.png"><img src="https://degreesofzero.com/article/beyond-coffee-bitcoin-for-every-day-use-with-lnurl/images/lnurl-auth-key-tree.png" alt=""></a></p></div>


<p>The protocol dictates that the user's app should deterministically derive a "hashing key" and use that to derive a unique linking key for each service with which the user attempts to authenticate. Privacy of the user is protected because the user's app provides a unique public key to each service. App developers are encouraged to follow the derivation scheme defined in the specification to allow for portability between apps.</p>
<h2 id="open-channel-request">Open Channel Request</h2>
<p>Probably the least popular of the subprotocols, lnurl-channel allows an end-user to request that a channel be opened to their node.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose user has a balance on a certain service which he wishes to turn into an incoming channel and service supports such functionality. This would require many parameters so the resulting QR may be overly dense and cause scanning issues. Additionally, the user has to make sure that a connection to target LN node is established before an incoming channel is requested.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you'd like to add support for LNURL to your own app or service, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl">this comprehensive list</a> for tools, libraries, and other services that already support it.</p>
<p>During the lockdown earlier this year, I created <a href="https://lnurl-toolbox.degreesofzero.com/">lnurl-toolbox</a> - a browser-based tool to test mobile and browser-based implementations of the LNURL protocol. If you'd like to try it out for yourself, I recommend the BLW wallet app (linked above) because it has the most comprehensive LNURL support.</p>

			Unicode has superscript versions of numerical characters. These are however not
			always rendered correctly (e.g. they are currently broken on MacOSX and iOS
			with the default font). The reason is because the superscript character 1-3
			are defined in separate code blocks from characters 0, 4-9. On Apple products,
			the default font has superscript characters 1-3 but falls back to a different
			font for the other numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			A simple fix would be for Apple to add the other superscript characters to
			the default font (or remove 1-3 and fallback for all superscript characters, but
			that might break software which doesn't implemenent font fallback).
		</p>
		<p>This is a test page. You can compare how your browser renders with the
			default font vs screenshots of what I'm getting.</p>

		<p>Some superscript numbers don't line up:</p>
		<p>Your browser: x⁰, x¹, x², x³, x⁴, x⁵, x⁶, x⁷, x⁸, x⁹.</p>
		<p>Screenshot of mine: <img srcset="https://www.quaxio.com/unicode_superscript1.png 2x" src="https://www.quaxio.com/unicode_superscript1.png"></p>

		<p>As a result, some of the following lines look like x^(ab), others look like x^a^b, and
		others just look broken.</p>
		<p>Your browser:</p>
    <p>x⁰⁰, x⁰¹, x⁰², x⁰³, x⁰⁴, x⁰⁵, x⁰⁶, x⁰⁷, x⁰⁸, x⁰⁹</p>
    <p>x¹⁰, x¹¹, x¹², x¹³, x¹⁴, x¹⁵, x¹⁶, x¹⁷, x¹⁸, x¹⁹</p>
    <p>x²⁰, x²¹, x²², x²³, x²⁴, x²⁵, x²⁶, x²⁷, x²⁸, x²⁹</p>
    <p>x³⁰, x³¹, x³², x³³, x³⁴, x³⁵, x³⁶, x³⁷, x³⁸, x³⁹</p>
    <p>x⁴⁰, x⁴¹, x⁴², x⁴³, x⁴⁴, x⁴⁵, x⁴⁶, x⁴⁷, x⁴⁸, x⁴⁹</p>
    <p>x⁵⁰, x⁵¹, x⁵², x⁵³, x⁵⁴, x⁵⁵, x⁵⁶, x⁵⁷, x⁵⁸, x⁵⁹</p>
    <p>x⁶⁰, x⁶¹, x⁶², x⁶³, x⁶⁴, x⁶⁵, x⁶⁶, x⁶⁷, x⁶⁸, x⁶⁹</p>
    <p>x⁷⁰, x⁷¹, x⁷², x⁷³, x⁷⁴, x⁷⁵, x⁷⁶, x⁷⁷, x⁷⁸, x⁷⁹</p>
    <p>x⁸⁰, x⁸¹, x⁸², x⁸³, x⁸⁴, x⁸⁵, x⁸⁶, x⁸⁷, x⁸⁸, x⁸⁹</p>
    <p>x⁹⁰, x⁹¹, x⁹², x⁹³, x⁹⁴, x⁹⁵, x⁹⁶, x⁹⁷, x⁹⁸, x⁹⁹</p>

		<p><b>Why do I care?</b> Some Wikipedia pages use numerical superscript
			characters and can lead to mistakes!</p>

        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫

Concurrent systems usually has the reputation of being very difficult and I’ve designed and written a massively concurrent project
from the ground up in my OO days, included writing all the scheduling and concurrency primitives, and managing all the thread-safety myself (those were different times).
I found this piece of work an order of magnitude harder than that.</p><p>I say in the ShipReq <a href="https://blog.shipreq.com/about">About</a> page that <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is like a compiler.
The big feature that I completed recently was the most compiler-like feature yet, and to my surprise it’s specifically that property that made it so deceptively hard.
What is the feature?
Basically when you have a bunch of requirements / issues / design documents / whatever,
this feature adds automation to populate certain fields according to their relationships and related fields so that
users don’t have to manually edit or maintain it all themselves, which is both tedious and error-prone.
An example would be if someone raises a bug which requires a few dev tasks to fix, one could setup their project so that when all those dev marks are marked as
“complete” the bug itself automatically changes to “ready for testing”.
This feature doesn’t have any knowledge of “completion” or “testing”, but allows users to define whatever states and rules they want.
That might not sound like it relates to writing a compiler.
(It probably doesn’t even sound hard.)
Nor do requirements, bug reports, project documents seem very relatable to code.
But there are surprising similarities. Let’s take a look…</p><h2>Similarity #1: Relationships</h2><p>Nearly all data relationships in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> are many-to-many / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAGs</a>.
Some views in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> present data as flat lists but under-the-hood it’s very rare that anything is stored as a flat list,
and there’s nearly always a way to view the same data as a graph or tree.</p><p>If you squint a bit, source code is kind of like that too.
Packages have multiple classes / objects which have multiple methods / fields / inner classes that have multiple statements that have multiple clauses, etc.
In terms of declaration, it’s more one-to-many than many-to-many but it’s still all a big DAG.
When we start considering relationships like imports and methods calling other methods, then it becomes many-to-many too and we get a cyclic graph.</p><h2>Similarity #2: Interactions</h2><p>Secondly, this new feature in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is very configurable by users.
It’s a major goal of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> to avoid hardcoding implicit assumptions and find appropriate and configurable abstractions.
Obviously having users need to reconfigure everything all the time would be a terrible burden so we provide pre-configured
complete setups with best-practices which users can (optionally) use, and can reconfigure without restriction to best serve their needs.
What that means from a coding point of view, is that we never know the automation rules at compile-time.
The code needs to understand and apply all the rules at runtime, and it needs to be able to
recognise and handle data and logic combinations that invalidate invariants. That might not sound like a big deal but there are
many invariants in a complex system and invariants don’t stop at their immediate domain boundary - they propagate
though all relevant graphs and compose, with various levels of complexity, with other invariants.</p><p>For example you may have 10 simple invariants in 10 isolated domains, but when they’re all combined the number of states
to consider becomes 10,000,000,000 and there’s going to be a very significant percentage of those states that you’d consider
illegal (i.e. bugs).</p><p>This too is like writing a compiler.
For example, the Java compiler doesn’t hardcode the privacy level of your classes; it allows you to set it yourself.
Where as <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> might have a UI page for config, in Java you have modifier keywords such that <code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code> is different than <code><span>private</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code>.
From the perspective of writing a compiler, these are runtime values with runtime rules.
When we consider additional keywords like <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> we start getting into what I meant about combinational explosions.
The Java compiler, at runtime, has to ensure all possible combinations are valid. For example, it will reject the following code:</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>final</span> <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>and</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Imagine you were writing your own Java compiler.
It’s entirely up to you to think about those illegal combinations and then write the code to catch them.
I think we all take for granted things like marking a method as private and then knowing it’s impossible to
call externally, but under-the-hood that it’s not impossible at all. You’re literally relying on someone’s
<code>if</code> statement in the right place. Just like my <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> example, it’s all value inspection at runtime,
with no guarantees about how all the features will interact. The class/method privacy feature interacting
with <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> features is mentally easy enough but every single feature has the ability to
interact badly with something else and it’s not always easy to identify those combinations.</p><p>I recently saw <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PR to Scala</a> that’s a great
demonstration of exactly this.
The <code>private</code> and <code>sealed</code> keywords have been in Scala forever and someone only <em>just</em> recently
came up with the realisation that private classes are effectively sealed.
Scala’s been in existence for 16 years!
When you have hundreds of features it doesn’t seem feasible to manually consider each possible combination.
100 features yields 4950 unique pairs. There’s nothing special about pairs though, some issues may only
manifest when three specific features intersect. For 100 features there are:</p><ul><li>4950 unique sets of 2</li><li>161,700 unique sets of 3</li><li>3,921,225 unique sets of 4</li><li>…</li><li>17,310,309,456,440 unique sets of 10</li></ul><p>It’s not unlikely to have a bad interaction between 10 features out of a possible 100.
It’s just impossible to manually consider.</p><h2>Similarity #3: Type-Unsafety</h2><p>Type-safety is a pillar that I depend on all the time. And no please don’t think of Java’s type system
when you think type-safety, that’s not really what I mean, although it’s a start.
I mean more the type systems in languages like <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scala</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell</a>, think features like existential and dependent types.
Type systems like Java’s and Typescript’s are great! They add value! But you can be an order of magnitude or two
more safe with more advanced type systems and it’s profoundly beneficial when you learn how to make good use of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, type-safety didn’t help me very much when developing my big feature.
Say you’ve got one data location than can accept a set of values. At compile-time, every runtime value is acceptable
because there always exists a configuration that would allow each possible value to be legal.
It’s like having a ‘Name’ field of type <code>String</code>, and then a runtime rule dictating the required first letter of the name.
<em>(Unrealistic but it’s the concept I’m highlighting.)</em>
The configuration might be <code>firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span></code>. In such a case you <em>have to</em> have the name field
be something accommodating of all possibilities, like <code>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span></code>.
You could be tricky an create a type that encodes a proof of the name such that it adheres to the rule, but that’s only
a derivation of <code><span>(</span>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code>.
Unless the name and the configuration and atomically modifiable as a single, composite value, you still need to
store both values independently before such a derivation.
The first-letter of a name restriction is a toy example but it demonstrates the fact that you have runtime configuration
in one location, runtime data in the other, and no type-safety at compile-time to enforce that the right thing happens at runtime.</p><p>Compilers have the same problem. They maintain a huge repository of runtime data, and it’s entirely up to the compiler authors
to apply all of the rules, move data in and out of scope depending on other runtime-only conditions, etc, etc.
And unlike us compiler <em>users</em>, they don’t have the benefit of being able to rely on (much of) a type system.
They’re on their own and can only use type safety to guard the bottom layers of their very-complex domain.</p><h2>Similarity #4: Feedback</h2><p>It’s a necessary part of the process that things will go wrong, and users need to be provided meaningful feedback.</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a>, it will…</p><ul><li>detect changes that are always wrong, and prevent the user from making those changes. These are errors.</li><li>detect data/config that has become wrong, modify derivation accordingly, and present them to users in a fully-comprehensible manner. These are warnings.</li><li>collect all info required to explain to users exactly how, why and from where, derived data came to be.
Automatedly populating/amending users’ data is one thing, but I believe users should be able to inspect and understand things like
what steps were performed, and what data were factors.
This is provenance.
It doesn’t sound that hard but in practice it was surprisingly challenging to implement.</li></ul><p>Compilers do the same thing. They…</p><ul><li>detect illegal data and combinations of data at runtime, and explain them to users. Those are errors.</li><li>detect data that is acceptably or potentially wrong, handle them, maybe by ignoring the statement, or modifying the generated code somehow,
and then finally, they flag this to users. These are warnings.</li><li>some compilers calculate how something has come to be and …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                    This is an <b>intermediate</b> article for PHP. I will assume you have a general understanding of how the language works, how to install and load dependencies, and the basics of object-oriented programming in PHP. I don't expect you to know about things like factories, dependency injection etc
                </p><div>
                    <p>Telegram is one of the two cool kids on the messaging app market right now. Especially since the
recent upset with WhatsApps new data sharing policy the user numbers have positively skyrocketed.
There's now over 500 million people using the app.</p>
<p>Personally I've been using it since 2015. Since 2018, I've used it for 95% of my daily communication.
During that time I also found out that Telegram has a really cool Chat Bot API! So I've built a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>One keeps track of my appointments and sends reminders</li>
<li>One tracks shipping goals for a chat group of my friends</li>
<li>One that checked who in the group got made fun of the most</li>
<li>One that tracks some metrics of my company (audience growth, ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I'd like to teach you how to do the same. Because a future where we all have a personal
army of automated chat robots is definitely one I want to live in!</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To follow along with this article you'll need only two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>A working installation of PHP 7.2+ and <a href="https://getcomposer.php/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Composer</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Telegram app</a> and an account</li>
</ul>
<p>To create our bot, we need a special token from Telegram itself. We can get this
from an automated bot, too! It's called <a href="https://t.me/botfather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@BotFather</a> and
it will guide you through the setup process. So let's do that now!</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c5efe9182615fadf335742d15b23d64c62b434a6/31968/assets/posts/telegram-bot/01.png" alt="Setup process with BotFather" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Congratulations! You have set up your first Telegram bot. Be sure to note down that token from
the last message. We'll need it in a few minutes. You can also further customize your bot with
a profile image and such. I'll leave that up to you.</p>
<h2>Setting up your PHP project</h2>
<p>Now it's time to get down to the actual core of this project: Implementing the chat bot.
We'll start as with any good PHP project in <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code>: By setting up a Composer project.</p>
<pre><code>$ composer init</code></pre>
<p>While we could directly deal with the HTTP API of Telegram, there is a <a href="https://github.com/irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">very nice library</a>
already built for us by Irfaq Sayed. So let's grab that too!</p>
<pre><code>$ composer require irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk</code></pre>

<p>Then it's time to define our directory structure. When I build Telegram bots, I generally follow
a structure that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>chat-bot/
â”œâ”€ composer.json
â”œâ”€ composer.lock
â”œâ”€ vendor/
â”œâ”€ src/
â”œâ”€ public/
â”œâ”€ .env
â”œâ”€ bootstrap.php
â”œâ”€ helpers.php
â”œâ”€ setup.php</code></pre>
<p>First we have our regular files as generated by Composer. </p>
<p><code>src/</code> is the folder where we place all of our commands and other application-specific code. </p>
<p><code>public/</code> will contain the code we expose to the scary, scary reality of the internet. </p>
<p><code>bootstrap.php</code> will set up some things such as including our autoloader
and loading variables from our <code>.env</code> file. We'll include that one a lot.</p>
<p><code>helpers.php</code> usually contains small utility functions that don't fit anywhere else. </p>
<p>Last but not least, <code>setup.php</code> is a small file that helps us set up our connection with Telegram.</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to copy that token we got from BotFather earlier and put it in our <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<pre><code># .env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="1234567890:YOUR_TOKEN"</code></pre>

<p>To wrap up this setup sequence all that's left to is to set up our autoloader. To do this we modify our
<code>composer.json</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code>"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "Pretzel\\": "src/"
    },
    "files": [ "helpers.php" ]
}</code></pre>

<p>The change essentially summarizes to this: Load everything from <code>src/</code> into the <code>Pretzel</code> namespace,
and please also load the <code>helpers.php</code> file specifically.</p>
<p>Now we finally have our PHP project ready to go!</p>
<h2>Setting up the connection with Telegram</h2>
<p>Telegram works with an event-based system to let you know when new updates arrive. For this purpose
we need to set up a webhook handler. In real world terms this just a PHP file that Telegram sends
a request to every time somebody messages our bot. Fancy!</p>
<p>First, we'll need our bot's token. That is how we identify to Telegram who we are. As you may remember
we put that into a <code>.env</code> file. So let's set up loading variables from that.</p>
<pre><code>$ composer require vlucas/phpdotenv</code></pre>
<p>Then we add the following to our <code>bootstrap.php</code></p>
<pre><code>// bootstrap.php

&lt;?php

require __DIR__ . "/vendor/autoload.php";

$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv-&gt;load();</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to that short and sweet snippet we can now easily grab values from our <code>.env</code> file by using the
<code>env()</code> function. This is not a native PHP function, but the Telegram Bot SDK brings it along as a dependency.</p>
<p>Next, I want to set up a small helper function in our <code>helpers.php</code></p>
<pre><code>// helpers.php

&lt;?php

function telegram(): \Telegram\Bot\Api
{
    return new \Telegram\Bot\Api(
        env('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')
    );
}</code></pre>
<p>This is purely for convenience. It allows us to grab an instance of the Telegram API wrapper without
constantly having to query the <code>.env</code> file again. Now we can combine those two things in our <code>setup.php</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>// setup.php

&lt;?php

require 'bootstrap.php';

telegram()-&gt;setWebhook(['url' =&gt; env('TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK')]);

echo "Setup the Telegram webhook!";</code></pre>

<p>Hold your horses. Readers with sharp eyes will have noticed, that I'm getting a <code>TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK</code>
from the <code>.env</code> file. We don't have that yet, right? Right.</p>
<p>We need to pass Telegram some kind of URL it can send its updates to. How do we do this on localhost?
I'm glad you asked. Being a PHP developer in 2021 is a wonderful experience, so we have the perfect tool for
this. It's called <code>expose</code> and it's made by BeyondCode.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are other options out there too. Something like ngrok would work just as well. I like
expose because it's easy to set up and provides custom subdomains for free.
</p>

<h3>Setting up your local webhook</h3>
<p>To get started with getting an URL for our local environment, first we install <code>expose</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ composer global require beyondcode/expose</code></pre>
<p>This installs the <code>expose</code> utility globally and gives us access to it. If you've been
using Composer for a while you've probably already done that, but make sure that <code>composer global config bin-dir --absolute</code>
is in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Next we need to run our PHP somehow. For a project such as this the integrated PHP web server is fine.
So we can use the following in the root directory of your project to get it running:</p>
<pre><code>$ php -S localhost:8080 -t public

[Mon Jan 18 11:28:18 2021] PHP 8.0.0 Development Server (http://localhost:8080) started</code></pre>
<p>Then, open another terminal tab and run the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ expose share localhost:8080 --subdomain=pbbot</code></pre>

<p>In the resulting output towards the end you should find a URL ending in <code>sharedwithexpose.com</code>.
In my case it is <code>pbbot.sharedwithexpose.com</code> and that is the URL we need. <strong>Remember it!</strong></p>
<h3>Making it more ergonomic (optional)</h3>
<p>Running two different terminal tabs at once is cumbersome. So let's make use of âœ¨magical Composer scriptsâœ¨
so we only have to run one command to get our bot up to speed. We can make use of the <code>&amp;</code> functionality of
the shell to run both things at the same time. So you can add this to your <code>composer.json</code></p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
    "dev": "php -S localhost:8080 -t public &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp; expose share localhost:8080 --subdomain=pbbot"
}</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&amp;&gt;/dev/null</code> stuff just ensures that the output of the original PHP web server does not mess with
<code>expose</code>. Since <code>expose</code> gives us a nice request overview, we don't need it anyways. Now you can run
a single command, and your bot comes alive!</p>
<pre><code>$ composer run dev</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add our webhook URL to our <code>.env</code> file</p>
<pre><code># .env

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="1234567890:YOUR_TOKEN"
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK="https://pbbot.sharedwithexpose.com/webhook.php"</code></pre>

<p><code>webhook.php</code> will be the file we use to handle any incoming requests from Telegram. We'll create it in
the next step. First, we want to run our little <code>setup.php</code> script.</p>
<pre><code>$ php setup.php
Setup the Telegram webhook!</code></pre>

<h3>Setting up your webhook handler</h3>
<p>So we just told Telegram to please send us any information to <code>webhook.php</code>, but we don't have that file yet.
We'll just create it in our <code>public/</code> folder. The webhook handler is essentially responsible for grabbing
any unprocessed updates, forwarding them to our bot, and returning a result to Telegram. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// public/webhook.php

&lt;?php

require __DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php';

telegram()-&gt;commandsHandler(true);</code></pre>
<p>I think by now you can see why the Telegram Bot SDK is useful. The fact that we have to call only one function
to set up an entire command system is super useful and keeps productivity high!</p>
<h2>Writing your first command</h2>
<p>Now that we have all the annoying setup stuff out of the way, we can write our first command.
Let's start with the most bare-bones command imaginable: When we say <code>/hello</code> to our bot, we want it to
say <code>Hello World</code> back to us.</p>
<p>First, we have to create a new class for our command. I'll put it in <code>src/Commands/HelloCommand.php</code>, so
we can access it through the class <code>Pretzel\Commands\HelloCommand</code>. Every command we create needs to inherit
from the Bot SDKs base class. It also needs to have a name. So the basic structure looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>// src/Commands/HelloCommand.php

&lt;?php

namespace Pretzel\Commands;

use Telegram\Bot\Commands\Command;

class HelloCommand extends Command
{
    protected $name = 'hello';

    public function handle()
    {
        // TODO: Implement command
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now inside the <code>handle()</code> function, we have access to a whole bunch of <code>replyWith*</code> type functions
that we can use to respond to the message we just received. The easiest way is to use <code>replyWithMessage</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/217e33d165b186e48d7e2db7028a9f4e8ee6224c/dd7cc/assets/posts/telegram-bot/02.png" alt="Suggestion box showing all replyWith* functions" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>These functions all take a bunch of arguments in the form of an array. I can't even tell you
all of them by heart. Thankfully, there's good documentation! To find out what you need to send
to the function, you can just look it up <a href="https://telegram-bot-sdk.readme.io/reference#sendmessage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the API Methods documentation</a>.
I also highly recommend the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Telegram documentation</a> for more
detailed information.</p>
<p>Each <code>send*</code> function corresponds to one of our <code>replyWith*</code> functions.</p>
<p>The important thing that these <code>replyWith*</code> functions do is adding the <code>chat_id</code> parameter to our arguments.
So …</p></div></div>

He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>

<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>

<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>

<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>

<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>

<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3d440196438b8c552ee9"><div><p>One day, on my commute to work, I wondered – "How deep underground am I?" Escalators, stairs, lifts, mazes of tunnels… no idea. I searched the internet – a few people have done curiosity maps and played with Beck's design, so surely one of depths must exist. Trawling the internet, seeking to satiate my curiosity, I found nothing. So my curiosity turned into a mission – I would create these. I set on to research and got an excel sheet from TfL.</p><p>Taking a page from Beck's book, I couldn't represent distances between stations to scale, as that would have render most diagrams impractical. The only accurate scale would be that of depth. I  created the first diagram – the Victoria line, one of the simplest. Once I got on to the Central line I realised my approach had to change – some lines have different branches, and as the diagrams represent a unique path, I couldn't create a single diagram for the whole line.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-1248e73b2db85bb3239a"><div><p>The obvious solution at the time, it seemed, was for me to choose, within each specific Underground line, the minimal number of A-B journeys that would cover all of its stations. Creating the diagrams was time-consuming. So many numbers and calculations, double- and triple-checking. Once the diagrams were completed they didn't seem right – yes, I knew all the depths of the stations, but the way I'd displayed them didn't seem correct.</p><p>The answer arrived via the Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. These have so many different branches that you need to be certain of which service you get. And this was when the obvious dawned on me. Sure, lines branch out, but trains go from A-B. What the diagrams had to represent was not the lines but the services of these lines. So I checked all the services from all the lines (33 in total) and re-created the diagrams accordingly.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

January 19, 2021 | https://drawer.design/blog/how-to-render-json-file-in-adobe-after-effects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://drawer.design/blog/how-to-render-json-file-in-adobe-after-effects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Let’s start with Bodymovin plugin</h2>
<p>Bodymovin is an After Effects extension for exporting the animation to a JSON file, which you can use on your website or in your Android or iOS app.</p>
<p>You can download it for free <a href="https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.12557.bodymovin.html">here</a> or <a href="https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/">here</a>, where you can show your love to the creators and pay any price you want.</p>
<p>After downloading Bodymovin, you’ll get bodymovin.zxp file (Adobe zip Format Extension Package file) that you can install with Adobe’s Extension Manager or use a <a href="https://zxpinstaller.com/">zxp installer</a>.</p>
<h2>Get your design into Adobe After Effects</h2>
<p>Your tools are ready, now let’s animate! To be as efficient as possible, it’s good to have a nicely prepared design file. You can save a lot of time by preparing the design in advance. If you don’t know how to prepare the design file, check our <a href="https://drawer.design/blog/how-to-prepare-design-file-for-lottie-animation/">previous blog</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Import your Adobe Illustrator file</strong></h3>
<p>Import the design file into Adobe After Effects. Select <span>”</span>File”&nbsp;in the top bar and choose <span>”</span>Import<span>”</span> option. (File &gt; Import)</p>
<p>When importing your organized .ai file into the Adobe After Effects, make sure the <span>”</span>Import As<span>”</span> option is selected as <span>”</span>Composition – Retain Layer Sizes<span>”</span>. With this option chosen Adobe After effects will import the layers exactly as they are saved in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/import-file.png" alt="import file dialog" width="660" height="440" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/import-file.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/import-file-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<h3><strong>Convert .ai layers to shape layers</strong></h3>
<p>The great thing about Lottie is that it works well with vectors, and that’s the magic why JSON files are so tiny.</p>
<p>Converting the layers from Illustrator file into After Effects vector shapes is fairly straightforward. Select all layers, right-click and select <span>”</span>Create<span>”</span>&nbsp;and then choose <span>”</span>Create shapes from Vector layer<span>”</span>&nbsp;option.</p>
<p>Bodymovin would export the layers as raster images without this step and increased the JSON file size.</p>
<p>After creating the shapes, you can delete or hide original .ai layers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/create-shapes-from-vectors.png" alt="" width="660" height="440" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/create-shapes-from-vectors.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/create-shapes-from-vectors-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<h3><strong>Set your composition settings</strong></h3>
<p>Go to <span>”</span>Composition<span>”</span>&nbsp;and select <span>”</span>Compositions Settings<span>”</span>&nbsp;to adjust your Width and Height, Duration of an animation, or Frame Rate. Lottie animations support up to 60 fps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composition-settings.png" alt="Composition settings dialog" width="660" height="601" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composition-settings.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composition-settings-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>Set Background Color (black in our case) will not be rendered into your Lottie animation; the background will be transparent. To see the transparency of the document, click on the <span>”</span>Toggle Transparency Grid”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/toggle-transparency-grid.png" alt="toggle transparency grid in ui" width="660" height="290" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/toggle-transparency-grid.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/toggle-transparency-grid-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<h3><strong>Pro tip</strong></h3>
<p>When you work with Ai files in Adobe After Effects more often as we do, we highly recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.battleaxe.co/overlord">Overlord</a>&nbsp;plugin; it will save your time.</p>
<p>With Overlord, you can send the Illustrator layers into the Adobe After Effects with one click. It will import Adobe After Effects shape layers and preserve layer names and position. Overlord can further export guides, color palettes, gradients &amp; editable text layers as well.</p>
<h2>Create animation</h2>
<p>When it comes to animating itself, try to use only basic features – scale, position, rotation, opacity, or animate paths. If you want to use some advanced Features, always check Supported After Effects Features first.</p>
<p>We advise you not to use raster files (it affects the file size) and any effects from the Effects panel; most of them are not supported by Lottie.</p>
<h2>Export the JSON file</h2>
<p>Once you have created your animation and are satisfied with the result, navigate to <span>”</span>Window<span>”</span>,&nbsp;select <span>”</span>Extensions<span>”</span>, and choose <span>”</span>Bodymovin<span>”</span>&nbsp;option. (Window &gt; Extensions &gt; Bodymovin)</p>
<p>Now select a composition or multiple compositions that you want to render.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-dialog.png" alt="bodymovin dialog for rendering the animation" width="660" height="424" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-dialog.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-dialog-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>When you go to the <span>”</span>Settings<span>”</span>&nbsp;in the Bodymovin dialog, you can see a few different options you can choose from. Each option is well explained, but you might not know what GUIDED layers are. Plugins create those layers for rigging characters like Duik or RubberHose, so if you are using such a plugin, make sure to select the option.</p>
<p>If you like to see your Lottie animation implemented in the HTML file, you can quickly test if the animation works as designed and select <span>”</span>Demo<span>”</span>&nbsp;in the <span>”</span>Export Modes<span>”</span>&nbsp;section. Another option to test your animation is using our <a href="https://drawer.design/preview-lottie-animation/">Lottie Preview</a>, where you can drag and drop your JSON file.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-settings.png" alt="bodymovin settings dialog" width="660" height="592" srcset="https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-settings.png 660w, https://drawer.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bodymovin-settings-300x269.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>Save the settings and hit <span>”</span>Render<span>”</span>.</p>
<h2>Final animation</h2>
<p>That’s it! Your Lottie animation is ready to be implemented on your website or in your app to improve the experience and delight your users.</p>
<h2>Looking for ready to use animations?</h2>
<p>Not every company has the assets to hire an animator to create custom Lottie animations. In this case, we are providing an out-of-the-box solution in the form of ready to use animations. <a href="https://drawer.design/">Check out our library</a> of pre-made animations.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

  4 minute read

</p>
          
        </header>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I received a question from a FOSS project maintainer, paraphrased here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve created a new project and are ready to tell people about it. We’d like more contributors and patrons and need some pointers on how/where to get the word out. How can we publicize the project to a wide audience?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they describe is a fairly common marketing use case for FOSS projects…or, well, pretty much any other thing looking to get eyeballs &amp;/or support.</p>

<p>So that’s my first pointer: <strong>Pick up some practical intro to marketing books from your local public library</strong> (and read them, natch). Marketing knowledge is remarkably useful.</p>

<p>Pointer two: Right up front, <strong>define what success will look like for this effort</strong>. You have a goal or you wouldn’t be looking to do all this work. In very clear and explicit terms, what is that goal? “Downloads next year are triple what we had this year,” or “We have 12 new contributions a month from at least 4 new contributors.” Or maybe “We have 30 long-term patrons,” or “All our testing infrastructure costs are covered by patrons.” Concrete is important here. Don’t be wishy-washy. Unclear goals aren’t attainable because you can never tell whether you’ve reached them.</p>

<p>Pointer three: Get the outreach team together (it may just be you) and <strong>answer these questions</strong>…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Whom do you want to reach?</em> You may have multiple audiences for your outreach. For instance: contributors, users, and patrons may have some overlap as audiences but generally speaking they each have different needs and their heads turn for different messages. If it turns out you want to reach multiple audiences, you may need to craft multiple messages and get the word out in multiple places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What does the audience(s) care about?</em> It can be helpful to define each audience as a single persona/character. “Ellen is a potential user. She’s privacy-conscious and GPG-encrypts her email when possible. She’s very interested in the IndieWeb movement and runs her own Mastodon server for her and her friends and family…” Understanding and having empathy for your audience, knowing what they care about, allows you to create messages that they’re more likely to pay attention to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Where does the audience(s) you want to reach hang out?</em> You want to reach your audience, but where can you do that? These are known as the <em>channels</em> for your outreach. Conference talks? Online videos? Websites? News sites? Mailing lists? Newsletters? Discord/Discourses? Social networks? One size does NOT fit all where audience outreach is concerned. Each of these channels will have their own communication norms, so knowing this can help you to craft the message to be something that’s effective or at least not offensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What are the other projects in this space, either competing or complementary?</em> Gain some situational awareness. Understand what else is out there in the landscape, where it’s moving to, and why. Your audiences will be asking about these other players, so best to anticipate that and incorporate mention of them in your messaging right up front. Comparisons, integrations, etc. What you discuss will depend upon what your audience cares about.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now you’ll be prepared to start creating the messages and getting them out there. This may include reaching out to the channels to establish relationships and get into their publishing pipeline. For instance, if you want to get an article placed in something like <a href="https://lwn.net/">lwn</a>, <a href="http://fosslife.org/">FOSSlife</a>, or <a href="https://opensource.com/">opensource.com</a>, these editors will have their own processes and timelines, and you’ll need to work with that rather than your own schedule.</p>

<p>Whatever else you do, please try your best to run the messaging past a member of the appropriate audience before pushing it live. Don’t assume that you know better than the audience what they need, and never assume you don’t need an editor. The audience member can help with a lot of that and catch many things before they become problems.</p>

<p>It sounds like a lot of work, I know, but if it starts feeling overwhelming then remember: You don’t need to do it all and you don’t need to do it all at once. For instance, if you want to reach multiple audiences, then maybe focus on just one at first then expand to others later. Or perhaps set a goal of one outreach message every other week until you can get the hang of it. Limiting the initial scope of the outreach project can also help you get a handle on the ongoing work that’ll be involved with it. Some types of outreach may lead to a lot of follow-up or conversation, and that can take a lot more time. It’s best to get a sense of that before you end up over your head.</p>

<p>There are some pointers, but it’s only a quick summary. Marketing is a big complicated thing that can’t be covered in a single blog post. There’s a reason people get paid to think about and do this stuff full time: it’s hard to do it well.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://readyplayer.me/blog/talking-about-realistic-3d-avatars-and-future-of-work-with-meetinvrs-ceo | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://readyplayer.me/blog/talking-about-realistic-3d-avatars-and-future-of-work-with-meetinvrs-ceo">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><b>What's the future of 3D avatars</b></h2><p>In November last year, we teamed up with <a href="https://www.meetinvr.com/">MeetinVR</a> to bring <a href="https://readyplayer.me/blog/making-virtual-meetings-more-real-with-personal-avatars">Ready Player Me avatars to virtual meetings</a>. Since then, users of MeetinVR can use their personal 3D avatars for meetings.Â&nbsp;</p><p>To celebrate our collaboration, Christian-Emanuel Anton (CEO of MeetinVR) interviewed Timmu TÃµke (CEO of Wolf3D). And, of course, it happened in MeetinVR's virtual studio. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QpxpcXwmFo">Check out the interview here</a>. You can also read the <a href="https://www.meetinvr.com/2021/01/11/timmu-toke-wolf3d-vr-avatars-meetinvr/">transcript here</a>. </p><iframe height="350" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6QpxpcXwmFo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2><b>The bigger shift towards virtual worlds</b></h2><p>The first topic that Christian and Timmu covered is the shift towards the virtual worlds, which got even more visible due to the pandemic. People started looking for virtual ways of spending time with their friends, families, and colleagues. For the last one, tools like MeetinVR, which offers a productivity-focused virtual reality experience, turned out to be particularly useful.</p><blockquote><p>We see a bigger shift towards virtual worlds for work [...], but also in entertainment and gaming. When you look at kids these days, they hang out in virtual worlds. This is how they spend their time and form relationships.</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Timmu TÃµke, CEO of Wolf3D</i></p><p>Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite all have over 100M monthly players who use these games as a place for hanging out. Kids age 9-13 in the US spend more time in Roblox than YouTube and Netflix combined. They are virtual worlds natives. For them, having a virtual workspace in the future will be very natural.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eyio9z469lzf/5A3uV76NYEV26muSkvSVf5/fe816104a25e19fe6f21d22aa8e3ad96/wolf3d_ceo_interview_meetinvr.png"></p><h2><b>Cross-platform 3D avatar creator</b></h2><blockquote><p>Because of the shift towards virtual worlds for communication, we need better ways to represent our identity.</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Timmu TÃµke, CEO of Wolf3D</i></p><p>There will be way more virtual world experiences in the future than just sandbox games and virtual meeting apps like MeetinVR. This raises a question â€“ <b>how are we going to represent ourselves in those apps and games?</b> Thatâ€™s the exact reason why we created Ready Player Me.Â&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Our ultimate goal is to create universal virtual world identities that travel with you between different platforms. They can change their look and style depending on what you want to use them for, but your identity will be consistent.</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Timmu TÃµke, CEO of Wolf3D</i></p><p>You can now use your Ready Player Me avatar in over 30 different apps and games, including Mozilla Hubs, LIV, and VRChat. All you have to do is to create your avatar and import it to the app. Soon, we want to make this process even more straightforward and allow you to customize your appearance globally.Â&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eyio9z469lzf/5fF1bK9Fdyk93zc2WfPiPK/b842693bb452782d1fa459376f43bc15/meetinvr_ready_player_me_interview.png"></p><h2><b>Are realistic 3D avatars the future?</b></h2><p>There are multiple ways of approaching avatar creation. One of them is going in the non-human direction. In MeetinVR's case, they started with robots, but their potential clients didn't like them.</p><blockquote><p>Companies couldn't associate with non-human avatars when we were presenting the tool to them.</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Christian-Emanuel Anton, CEO of MeetinVR</i></p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, we have hyper-realistic avatars. They precisely replicate how a person looks (which is where Wolf3D started). Those can look impressive, but without the right tracking technology to represent facial expressions, they look very offsetting.</p><blockquote><p>The more towards realism you go with an avatar, the creepier it gets. The technical term for effect is the â€˜uncanny valley.â€™</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Timmu TÃµke, CEO of Wolf3D</i></p><p>For the current consumer technology state, the middle ground with more cartoonish avatars is the best option. That's why we decided to go with this approach for Ready Player Me and focus on ease of use and cross-platform availability.Â&nbsp;</p><iframe height="350" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-v8fru7o7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>In MeetinVR, the implementation of our avatars is straightforward and limited to just the head and hands. It might seem weird when you watch them on a video, like in the interview itself, but it feels natural when you wear a VR headset.</p><blockquote><p>You don't need more than head and hands to get non-verbal communication in VR right.</p></blockquote><p><i>~ Christian-Emanuel Anton, CEO of MeetinVR</i></p><iframe height="350" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OcCeyfyKh8c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2><b>Future of human interaction</b></h2><p>To close the interview, Christian and Timmu did a small brainstorming session on the future of human interaction. Timmu pointed out that we will communicate with fewer people in the real world and shift to the metaverse and virtual worlds instead. As Christian said during the interview, this can have a positive impact on our environment. Instead of using Earth's resources and producing more tech equipment, all we will need for communication, work and entertainment will be contained in a VR or AR headset.</p><h2><b>Create your personal 3D avatar for MeetinVR</b></h2><p>If you're looking for a virtual reality collaboration tool, you have to check out MeetinVR. It's extremely simple to use and works on both tethered and standalone VR headsets. And if you want to use your Ready Player Me avatar, all you need to do is set it up in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP_xGQauFbs">MeetinVR's web portal</a>. </p><hr><p>If you want to learn more, <a href="mailto:info@wolf3d.io">contact our team</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/AKhfvr6QmY">join our Discord </a>server.</p><p><b>Sign up below to stay in touch with our developments.</b> ðŸ‘‡</p></div></div>]]>

The research is clear. Big or small, a little bit or habitual, procrastination is a problem that plagues productivity. </p><p>At Doit we help you get things done. If procrastination is getting in the way of doing your to-do list, this article is for you. This guide shares the surprising real reason we procrastinate, presents ideas to stop procrastinating and start doing <em>now</em>, and practices for getting out of the procrastination habit for good. Let’s do it.</p><h2 id="what-is-procrastination">What is Procrastination?</h2><p>Oxford Languages defines procrastination as “the act of postponing or delaying something.” That simple definition shows that procrastination is far reaching. It is not limited to school work or professional projects or personal obligations. Procrastination is omnipresent and can happen in every aspect of our lives.</p><p>College students are notorious procrastinators. Research papers and study sessions are put off until mere hours before the assignment is due or the test is administered. At work, professionals wait until the day before a big presentation to put together their speaking notes and infographics. Patients with anxiety about dental work put off seeing a dentist year after year until unavoidable pain pushes them to make an appointment.</p><p>The basic meaning leaves out an important aspect of procrastination illustrated by the examples above. When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing. &nbsp;A week before a deadline, we readily wander onto a social media feed or grab a snack or make a phone call to a friend. The day before that deadline, things look very different. We wait until we have no choice but to dive in and take care of the suddenly pressing problem, project, or task.</p><p>People who procrastinate are often mislabeled as lazy. Many of us even engage in self talk about how lazy or unfocused we are when we engage in procrastination. But procrastination is not a reflection of someone’s work ethic or their ability to focus. There’s more to it than that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Chronic procrastinators know that waiting will cause more harm than good. We know that this choice will ultimately lead to a worse outcome for us physically, emotionally, and otherwise, but we do it anyway. The Ancient Greeks called this state of mind “acrasia.” Our modern understanding of procrastination finds its roots in this bygone term, which means <strong>doing something “against your better judgement.” </strong></p><p>Why, oh why, would we put off the mere <em>potential</em> for pain today when we know with certainty it will cause worse suffering down the road? There are scientific theories behind that and they have nothing to do with work ethic or time management or motivation. The reasons are, surprisingly, rooted in our emotions.</p><h2 id="the-real-reason-we-procrastinate">The Real Reason We Procrastinate</h2><p>Dr. Fuschia Sirois is a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">told The New York Times</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to do something you know is going to have negative consequences.” She added, “ “People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.”</p><p>Dr. Tim Pychyl is also a professor of psychology and a member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. He said, “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.” <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91793/1/Compass%20Paper%20revision%20FINAL.pdf">Sirois and Pychyl teamed up in 2013</a> to research the notion that people place a priority on their immediate emotional needs over those of their future selves via procrastination. Here’s what they concluded.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>When faced with an “aversive” task, i.e. something that we find “boring, frustrating, lacking in meaning and/or structure,” we react with negative feelings and moods. Then we have a choice. We can get through those feelings and moods via “self-regulation” or we can succumb to the immediately protective choice of procrastination. Most of us choose the short-term solution. Avoiding the task gives us an emotional lift. We feel better. So we do it, or rather, <em>avoid doing it</em>, again and again. And before we know it, we are chronically procrastinating.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-procrastination">The Problem with Procrastination</h2><p>Sirois and Pychyl’s research shows that our future selves are paying a dear price for the short-term gratification we receive when we put things off. We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</p><p>We believe that when we sit down to work tomorrow, or next week, or next month before the big deadline, we will <em>feel</em> like doing it. But we are wrong. When we choose the temporary <a href="https://blog.doit.io/how-to-stay-focused-when-you-get-bored-working-toward-your-goals/">reprieve from boredom</a>, frustration, or challenge and kick the can down the road to our future selves, we are only making matters cumulatively worse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For one thing, a constant current of anxiety and tension will be along for the entire procrastination ride. This nagging looming deadline will be churning in the background, coloring our daily mood and impacting our health and well being. The negative feelings we have about the task itself make us procrastinate. That, in turn, leads to ruminating negative thoughts about the act of procrastination itself. It’s a cycle that has a snowball effect, gathering more self blame, shame, anxiety, and stress along the way.</p><p>For another, when we finally decide it’s “go time,” our job is much more daunting than it was before. We now have to take on a monumental task instead of one that is simply boring or frustrating. We will be faced with cramming a month’s worth of work into just a day or two. We won’t eat right, we sure won’t sleep right, our stress levels will soar, and our minds and bodies will suffer as a result.</p><p>It’s like credit card debt. The bill is going to come due. We can pay the full balance now, which is going to put a dent in our immediate account. Or, we can allow it to grow bigger and bigger as the interest charges stack up, costing us way more every single step along the way. Chronic procrastinators put it all on credit and pay significantly more in the end.</p><h2 id="5-techniques-to-stop-procrastinating-today">5 Techniques to Stop Procrastinating Today</h2><p>When we think about breaking free from the bad habit of procrastination, we benefit from taking a multipronged approach. We have a better chance of succeeding when we look at short term, immediate techniques as well as changes we can make in the long run that will help us make chronic procrastination a permanent part of our past. First, let’s look at ways to find immediate relief from putting a task off so we can get going at getting it done. </p><h3 id="1-short-list">1. Short List</h3><p>There is a reason why to-do lists stand the test of time when it comes to organization and productivity. They work! This list technique is all about keeping it short and simple.</p><p>Make a list of 3-6 things that you want to get done during your next work period. Put them in <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-myth-of-multitasking/">order of the most important</a> or time sensitive to the least important or time sensitive. Start working on the first task until it is finished. Check it off, mark it out, and move to the next item. Keep going until your work session ends. Move any tasks that are left undone to the new list you will create for your next session.</p><p>The new list should also be put in priority order. Lower priority tasks that are not time sensitive may be copied over to the bottom spot from list to list for days or even weeks! Don’t beat yourself up about it. Just keep it on the list until you get to it.</p><p>A note on timing: Some people like to make their list at the end of the previous work day or session. If you tend to ruminate at night and lose sleep when a list is running through your mind, plan to make the list as soon as you enter your work space the next day instead.</p><h3 id="2-digitally-declutter">2. Digitally Declutter</h3><p>Let’s face it. Distractions are very easily found these days. If you tend to wander into social media or headline news or your personal inbox instead of working on the more pressing task at hand, it’s time to digitally declutter your workspace.</p><p>The idea here is to make it harder to get distracted by removing the devices that hold those distractions. So, let’s say you need to create an outline for an upcoming …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>Guest Author</em>: <a href="https://github.com/sreekarsr">Sreekar</a></p>

<p>As part of a course on <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2019b-EE2025/index.html">Engineering Electromagnetics</a> in the Fall 2019 semester, we had to make a poster on a topic of our interest which involved electromagnetics, which we had to present at our department, on a fine Saturday afternoon (19.10.2019).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">How did we come up with this topic?<a href="#how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">#</a></h2>

<p>With my exams of the course having gone really bad (I still have nightmares about it :( ), I was determined to make my group’s poster one of the best that will be put up on poster day. The three of us, Sreekar, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithin-varma-17ba3b174">Nithin Varma</a> and I searched the internet for a topic that was “unconventional” and interesting. After a week or so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">following links on Wikipedia</a>, I came across this article - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)">Whistler (radio)</a>, which caught my eye. It was a topic that most would have not heard about and would be very much interested in learning about it. Bazinga!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sreekar had come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence">Birefringence</a>, which also seemed interesting. None of us had heard about it before. With these two topics in mind, we asked our instructor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ee.iitm.ac.in/deepav/">Dr. Deepa Venkitesh</a> for her opinion and she asked us to go with the former.</p>

<p>Before I start explaining the technical details of the poster, do take a look at the poster we made (click on it for a PDF).

<p>So here it goes.</p>

<p>In World War I, soldiers used long communication lines to maintain contact with their base. The people on the receiving side of the line, often could hear sounds that were very similar to that of <em>“falling grenades”</em>, when there were none falling. One keen observation was that this particular sound was heard during the times of lightning strikes.</p>

<p>Here’s a short sound clip of what they heard:</p>

<p>The first one, in which you would have noticed a tone of descending frequency, is called a <strong>Whistler</strong>, while the second, which consists of rising and falling tones of frequency is a <strong>Chorus</strong>. This post will talk more on whistlers as they are more extensively studied among the two.</p>

<p><strong>Whistlers</strong> are Very Low Frequency (VLF) emissions in the atmosphere that are characterised by a <em>tone of rapidly descending frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>Being long-wavelength (~ 100 km!!) <em>EM Waves</em>, it’s understandable that they couple into communication lines that are as long as 100 km. This explains the strange noises heard by soldiers in WWI.</p>

<h3 id="sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">Sources and generation of whistlers<a href="#sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>A natural question to ask is how these waves are generated in the first place. The literature on this is limited, but there is considerable evidence to say that the source of whistlers must be not very different from lightning.</p>

<p>The only known characteristic of whistlers that distinguishes it from ordinary lightning is their relatively high energy content. After accounting for attenuation losses, the estimated electromagnetic energy in a whistler producing stroke is about ten times as great as that in the average lightning flash. A sufficiently strong lightning flash should be able to produce whistler-mode signals.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing - we also detect these waves at locations where there may be no lightning at all. In fact, these waves can also be detected at places whose <em>magnetically conjugate point</em> has experienced a lightning strike. That means that there must be some <em>mode of propagation</em> that is making this possible. The theory behind it’s propagation can be intuitively understood using the basic concepts of a waveguide.</p>

<h3 id="waveguides">Waveguides<a href="#waveguides">#</a></h3>

<p>To the uninitiated, here’s the wikipedia definition of a waveguide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- pic of waveguide -->

<p>It literally is in the name - It “guides” waves, sort of like a tunnel (over-simplified). One very popular waveguide is the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_Fibre">optical fibre</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest idealised case of a waveguide is a <em>parallel plate waveguide</em>, in which the wave is constrained between <em>two conductors</em>. Solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions will give us a solution which has a wave that propagates in a direction tangential to the plates.</p>

<p>Now, consider the earth and the ionosphere. The earth is a good conductor, in the sense that at the frequencies we are talking about (KHz), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss#Loss_tangent">loss tangent</a>, is about 600.</p>

<p>The ionosphere, as its name suggests, has a lot of ions, making it a good conductor as well. What we now have is a waveguide through which EM waves, more specifically VLF waves, can be guided through.</p>

<h3 id="propagation-of-whistlers">Propagation of Whistlers<a href="#propagation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>Energy from a lightning source near the earth’s surface travels in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and enters the ionosphere continuously along the lower surface of the ionosphere. Wave components that enter the ionosphere at the location of a duct are then trapped and “conveyed” to the opposite hemisphere along the same magnetic line of force, which are aligned exactly along the duct, where they emerge from the ionosphere and re-enter the earth-ionosphere waveguide.</p>

<p>So…, a bunch of frequencies is generated by a lightning strike at a location, <em>at the same time</em>. All of them take the same path and reach another location. So, ideally we should be receiving all the frequencies at the same time. But we hear a tone of descending frequency. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The reason lies in the ionosphere. The velocity of propagation of a wave through the ionosphere is dependent on it’s frequency. This leads to a dispersion of waves, with each frequency traveling at a different speed.</p>

<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>Due to the dispersion of waves in the ionosphere depending on their frequencies, different frequencies are received at different times, with the higher frequencies being received first, as seen from the above graph. This is why a whistler is a tone of descending frequency.</p>

<h3 id="detection-of-whistlers">Detection of Whistlers<a href="#detection-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>The theory’s great. But how do we practically detect and hear these sounds?</p>

<p>Since these are electromagnetic waves, we have to first “capture” these EM waves, then transduce them, i.e. convert them to audio to actually hear the audio clips you heard before.</p>

<p>The wavelength of these waves are extremely huge (100 km for a 3KHz wave). This means that it is not possible to have a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php">full-wavelength antenna</a>, for capturing the wave accurately. A typical VLF receiver is about 60ft long - there is very little signal current for reception. Using a cascaded combination of high gain, high input impedance (for better sensitivity) amplifiers and low pass filters, we can make up for the difference.</p>

<p>What’s a <em>spectrogram</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a graph, with x-axis as time (usually), y-axis as frequency and the intensity/amplitude at a point $(f, t)$ is given by it’s color.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201.jpg">
</p><p>Whistler spectrogram</p>
<p>Source: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio</a>)</i></p>

<p>This is a real-life spectrogram of a whistler. At around <strong>0355:29</strong>, you can a see a band of frequencies being generated. This is called a <em>tweek</em>.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201-mark-tweek.jpg">
</p><p>Tweek in a spectrogram</p>

<p>At near <strong>0355:31</strong>, you see that the “tone of descending frequencies” has started. Notice how there’s a time delay between the tweek and the start of the whistler. This tells us that it is detected elsewhere (remember the magnetically conjugate point?), meaning it has travelled (or the whistler has been detected at the same place as the tweek.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Helliwell">Robert A. Helliwell</a>, in his book <em>Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena</em>, the idealised spectrogram for a whistler is:
<img title="ideal-spectrogram" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202.png"></p>

<p>Ideal whistler spectrograms</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>There’s a lot more in the above diagram than just ideal spectrograms. The figure shows us a wealth of information.</p>

<p>If you look closely, we can see the ideal spectrogram containing all the “<em>reflections</em>” of the whistler.</p>

<p><strong>Hold On!</strong> Where did reflections come from?
Well, as I had mentioned that it propagates, I had mentioned that the tweek generated would travel into an ionospheric duct, then come back into the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Well, EM waves, in fact any wave, simply don’t do nothing when they travel from one medium to another.</p>

<p>Because of the change in refractive indices of the media, some of the energy carried by the waves will be reflected into the first medium, and the rest will be transmitted into the second (there’s also absorption of energy, but I’m ignoring that as it is very less compared to the other two).</p>

<p>In this part of the above figure,
<img title="box1" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box1.png">
we can see the tweek, and also a number of whistlers, each dragged out more than the previous. Such whistlers are detected at the same place of origin of the tweek. They are called as <em><strong>Odd-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, since they have “hopped” or “jumped” (i.e. reflected) an odd number of times.</p>

<p><em>Why are they getting dragged out more?</em> Because, each undergoes a greater amount of dispersion than the previous as they travel a lot more distance after each reflection before detecting them.</p>

<p>Similarly, in this part of the figure,
<img title="box2" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box2.png">
we can see all the <em><strong>Even-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, and these are detected at the magnetically conjugate point to the point of origin of the tweek.</p>

<p>I had mentioned that the waves get dispersed in the ionosphere, right? Well, later studies showed that according to dispersion theory, every whistler should have a characteristic frequency (not necessarily the maximum frequency detected), that has the minimum time delay. This frequency is called <em>the nose …</em></p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve ever looked into your network tab when visiting a React app, chances are you’ve noticed that some apps send their entire bundle to their visitors. You might then wonder, how is that secure? Surely a motivated user could dive through React DevTools and find your protected routes?</p>
<p>First of all, you’d be correct - you won’t stop a motivated user from seeing your admin panel UI, but that shouldn’t worry us.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s your backend’s job to worry about authentication and authorization before sending data to the frontend.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works" aria-label="how it works permalink"></a>How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>When users first load a React app, the user state is empty, meaning the user is unauthenticated</li>
<li>We protect routes in React by redirecting unauthenticated users to our login page (see <a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/example/auth-workflow">React Router example</a>)</li>
<li>When the user logs in, we send a request to our backend, and check if the credentials are valid (via database query, or passing off the entire exchange to a third-party service like <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">AWS Cognito</a>)</li>
<li>If the credentials are valid, the backend generates a token that’s been <strong>signed</strong> with a secret we keep in the backend (so we know it’s from <em>our</em> backend), and sends the token to the frontend</li>
<li>Back on the frontend, we keep the token in state so that we stop redirecting users to the login page</li>
<li>Now that the user can visit protected routes, we also use the token (normally using the <code>Authorization</code> header) in all API requests to our backend</li>
<li>
<p>Our backend checks if the token is signed correctly, as well as which user the token belongs to, and whether the user has permission before sending back any data</p>
<ul>
<li>If the token is invalid, or not provided in the request, the backend sends back a response with a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401">HTTP status</a></li>
<li>If the token <strong>is</strong> valid, but the user doesn’t have permission to view the data, the backend sends back a response with a <code>403 Forbidden</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403">HTTP status</a></li>
<li>We can then display a big ERROR page on our frontend if the API returns a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response, and none of our precious data gets send to unauthorized users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If everything is valid, we display our protected UI along with our data, and the user gets to use your app</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="summary permalink"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In short, we shouldn’t be worried about protecting our frontend from being downloaded. At worst, they’ll find out what your admin/protected routes looks like, but won’t get anything valuable.</p>
<p>It’s the backend’s role to ensure the user is both who they say they are, and that they are allowed to see the data.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Maintaining functional and correct architecture documentation for your product is basically an unsolved problem. There are companies where this is critical and rooted in compliance regulations - like aviation - and they do it right, but at a high cost. Architecture documentation is quickly outdated, and in fast-growing companies, the product evolves so fast that trying to keep your documentation up to date continuously slows you down. The moment it gets outdated and entropy consumes it, the moment it loses credibility and trust.</p>

<p>Finding the right balance between moving fast and keeping high-quality documentation is very hard for scaling companies. In practically all cases, it’s always better to make trade-offs on documentation and move faster building product.</p>

<p>Another common problem of scaling engineering organisations is how to scale your best practices, cultivate culture and maintain knowledge. The most critical moments that shape engineering culture at the organisation are when you have to make trade-offs and rationalise decisions. Even well done, architecture documentation misses the rationale, representing only the result. And usually, it’s easy to see the decision being made. For example, we decided to model this system in that way, which is generally understandable from the codebase. But what’s missing is why did we make this decision?</p>

<p>If you feel that these problems are present in your organisation, experiment with Architecture Design Records.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-architecture-design-records">What are Architecture Design Records?</h2>
<p>Architecture Design Records are documents that describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the engineering problem that the team is facing at a time,</li>
  <li>requirements that we need to meet to solve this problem,</li>
  <li>a variety of solutions that we brainstormed before choosing a solution with their trade-offs</li>
  <li>and the detailed description of the solution we chose</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact template that the organisation uses will vary depending on the evolution of the process as you adopt it, your organisation’s current need, and your specific product.</p>

<p>At Intercom, we call them Tech Design documents and use Google Docs to write and store them. I know about other companies that write them in markdown and store in Github, in respective locations to code files that they touch.</p>

<p>I am not opinionated on the shape and format of this document. I think organisations should experiment and evolve their processes continuously, so it’s more important to start and iterate than come up with a perfect template.</p>

<p>However, I firmly believe that the past rationale and trade-offs analysis is one of the most valuable lessons that your organisation can take. Environment changes, constraints come and go, but the way someone distilled a problem, compared the options and made a decision is a prize on its own. That’s your engineering culture manifesting itself in real life. If your values and principles show in these documents, your culture is strong. But if they don’t, they are aspirational - and you need to work harder as a leader to ingrain them.</p>

<p>Who is a stakeholder of such documents? The team that wrote the document is a primary stakeholder. It increases the team’s engineering excellence and will be an artefact that the team itself will mostly use in the future. Additionally, in the case, you are a software consulting business, ADR stakeholder is also your customer. You can keep them up to date and aligned with your work.</p>

<p>Who is an approver? By default, especially in smaller or growing companies, it’s the team itself. More mature companies or those with higher costs of making mistakes, tend to have Architecture Review Boards that approve these docs.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-create-them-is-as-important-as-the-documents-itself">How you create them is as important as the documents itself.</h2>
<p>Writing Application Design Records is a process in itself. And the way your organisation does it is equally important as the output document!</p>

<p>First of all, creating ADRs can easily enforce collaboration and mentoring. A well-rounded collaboration group can have a technical leader overseeing the solution, more junior members learning through practice and someone detached from the team to bring unbiased opinion.</p>

<p>This process also scales your engineering excellence. By writing ADRs for significant problems, you allow your most senior leaders to scale their influence. If your Principal Engineer collaborates with a team of 15-20 engineers, it’s challenging for her to track all the critical decisions organically. ADRs ensure that teams will solicit other senior leaders’ inputs in a scalable and organised way.</p>

<p>You also create opportunities for peer review of the work even before the first line of code is written. As the saying goes, an hour of planning can save a week of development.</p>

<p>And last but not least, you share knowledge between teams that don’t work together organically. Especially in the remote environment!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-trial-and-adopt-the-process">How to trial and adopt the process?</h2>
<p>Writing documents can be a gruelling and disengaging task for engineers if they don’t understand the reasoning, can’t immediately see the value or leaders leading by example.</p>

<p>Try the following process to introduce ADRs as an experiment.</p>

<p><strong>1. Lead by your most senior engineers.</strong></p>

<p>The first ADS should be created under the leadership of one of your most tenured and experienced engineers. Lead by example and show the value of knowledge sharing and engineering excellence to your organisation from your best folks.</p>

<p><strong>2. Adopt only for a few significant design decisions.</strong></p>

<p>Don’t say that it’s obligatory to write ADRs for almost everything from now on. You might get there if your organisation becomes hard fans of the process, but don’t start there. Writing one or two every quarter to solidify the most important developments is already a great start. On the other hand, at Intercom, each team plan in 6-week cycles, and we would usually expect 5-6 tech design documents per team per cycle.</p>

<p><strong>3. Share widely and continuously look for feedback.</strong></p>

<p>Share your ADRs and ask for feedback as often as possible. We created a separate channel on Slack to share all our ADRs. It’s a big stream of artefacts, but every engineer can pick the ones they are most interested in. You work in customer-facing team day-to-day but would like to grow your skills and learn a bit about infrastructure? Pick and read ADRs from our infrastructure teams!</p>

<p>Did you try some form of Architecture Design Records in your organisation? Do you have lessons or observations you would like to share?</p>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

</p>


<p>Typical DBMSes suffer from a data type impedance mismatch with Haskell data types. Using such DBMSes in Haskell is especially painful because Haskell has a very powerful typing system which the database promptly discards or “downsamples” due to lack of real type support.</p>
<p>Project:M36 is a DBMS which offers support for algebraic data types (ADTs) as first-class database-side values and support for record types to be marshaled from-and-to database tuples without any loss of type enforcement. Furthermore, database-side ADTs can be manipulated with database-side stored functions written in Haskell. Types can further be preserved with constraints which can also be written in Haskell.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the common <a href="https://github.com/agentm/project-m36/blob/master/examples/blog.hs">blog post schema example</a> for an example of how these features all fit together.</p>

<p>Let’s start out by defining our model.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Blog</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span> {
<span>  title ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  entry ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  stamp ::</span> <span>UTCTime</span>,
<span>  category ::</span> <span>Category</span> <span>--note that this type is an algebraic data type</span>
  }
          <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>, <span>Show</span>) <span>--derive Generic so that Tupleable can use default instances</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Tupleable</span> <span>Blog</span>

<span>data</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>=</span> <span>Comment</span> {
<span>  blogTitle ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>,
<span>  commentTime ::</span> <span>UTCTime</span>,
<span>  contents ::</span> <span>T.Text</span>
  } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Generic</span>, <span>Show</span>)

<span>instance</span> <span>Tupleable</span> <span>Comment</span>             

<span>data</span> <span>Category</span> <span>=</span> <span>Food</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cats</span> <span>|</span> <span>Photos</span> <span>|</span> <span>Other</span> <span>T.Text</span>
  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Atomable</span>, <span>Eq</span>, <span>Show</span>, <span>NFData</span>, <span>Binary</span>, <span>Generic</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the only database-specific requirements are that the record-based models are instances of <code>Tupleable</code>, a type which can be derived from <code>Generic</code> types to marshal the Haskell values to-and-from database values. No database-specific type decorations (such as specifying SQL types) is needed. The database types are Haskell types with no type-level enforcement lost. Each record becomes a tuple in the database with the Haskell attributes directly mapped to tuple attributes.</p>
<p>The blog’s <code>Category</code> is an ADT which can be represented as a database value or <code>Atom</code>. Because the <code>Category</code> derives <code>Generic</code>, we can also derive <code>Atomable</code>. <code>Category</code> values are stored as ADTs in the database- no trickery is involved.</p>
<p>Note that an SQL enumeration would not be able to emulate an ADT directly as a database value. In Project:M36, the ADT is also represented in the database as a value of the same type. The type impedance mismatch is resolved and no database-specific changes to the model are necessary.</p>
<p>Next, let’s create our database and add some data.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()                       
main <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>--connect to the database</span>
  <span>let</span> connInfo <span>=</span> <span>InProcessConnectionInfo</span> <span>NoPersistence</span> emptyNotificationCallback []
  conn <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOError <span>$</span> connectProjectM36 connInfo

  sessionId <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOError <span>$</span> createSessionAtHead conn <span>"master"</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>createSchema ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()  
createSchema sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  _ <span>&lt;-</span> handleIOErrors <span>$</span> mapM (executeDatabaseContextExpr sessionId conn) [
    toAddTypeExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Category</span>),
    toDefineExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Blog</span>) <span>"blog"</span>,
    toDefineExpr (<span>Proxy</span><span> ::</span> <span>Proxy</span> <span>Comment</span>) <span>"comment"</span>,
    databaseContextExprForForeignKey <span>"blog_comment"</span> (<span>"comment"</span>, [<span>"blogTitle"</span>]) (<span>"blog"</span>, [<span>"title"</span>]),
    databaseContextExprForUniqueKey <span>"blog"</span> [<span>"title"</span>]
    ]
  pure ()</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we create an in-memory database (just for testing purposes) and use the <code>Tupleable</code> function <code>toDefineExpr</code> and <code>Atomable</code> function <code>toAddTypeExpr</code> to create expressions which we will execute against our database. A foreign key constraint between blogs and comments ensures that each blog can have zero or more comments. Finally, we add a uniqueness constraint on the blogs’ titles.</p>
<p>Naturally, if we wanted to store the database on disk or connect to a Project:M36 database server, we could configure that here.</p>

<p>We will use <code>scotty</code>, a lightweight web framework to present a user interface to display a list of blog posts and individual blog posts along with their blog-specific comments.</p>
<div><pre><code>scotty <span>3000</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  S.get <span>"/"</span> (listBlogs sessionId conn)
  S.get <span>"/blog/:blogid"</span> (showBlogEntry sessionId conn)
  S.post <span>"/comment"</span> (addComment sessionId conn)</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we set up our action handlers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>listBlogs ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()
listBlogs sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  eRel <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO <span>$</span> executeRelationalExpr sessionId conn (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"blog"</span> ())
  <span>case</span> eRel <span>of</span>
    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> render500 (toHtml (show err))
    <span>Right</span> blogRel <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
      blogs <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO (toList blogRel) <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> mapM (handleWebError <span>.</span> fromTuple)<span> ::</span> <span>ActionM</span> [<span>Blog</span>]
      <span>let</span> sortedBlogs <span>=</span> sortBy (\b1 b2 <span>-&gt;</span> stamp b1 <span>`compare`</span> stamp b2) blogs
      html <span>.</span> renderHtml <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
        h1 <span>"Blog Posts"</span>
        forM_ sortedBlogs <span>$</span> \blog <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>!</span> href (toValue <span>$</span> <span>"/blog/"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> title blog) <span>$</span> h2 (toHtml (title blog))</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we list all blog entries by querying the database for the relation variable “blog”. Then, we convert from database tuples to our <code>Blog</code> values using <code>Tupleable</code>’s <code>fromTuple</code> function. Then, we sort them by date and insert them into our <code>blaze-html</code> template.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>showBlogEntry ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()
showBlogEntry sessionId conn <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  blogid <span>&lt;-</span> param <span>"blogid"</span>
  <span>--query the database to return the blog entry with a relation-valued attribute of the associated comments</span>
  <span>let</span> blogRestrictionExpr <span>=</span> <span>AttributeEqualityPredicate</span> <span>"title"</span> (<span>NakedAtomExpr</span> (<span>TextAtom</span> blogid))
      extendExpr <span>=</span> <span>AttributeExtendTupleExpr</span> <span>"comments"</span> (<span>RelationAtomExpr</span> commentsRestriction)
      commentsRestriction <span>=</span> <span>Restrict</span>
                           (<span>AttributeEqualityPredicate</span> <span>"blogTitle"</span> (<span>AttributeAtomExpr</span> <span>"title"</span>))
                           (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"comment"</span> ())
  eRel <span>&lt;-</span> liftIO <span>$</span> executeRelationalExpr sessionId conn (<span>Extend</span> extendExpr
                                                         (<span>Restrict</span>
                                                          blogRestrictionExpr
                                                          (<span>RelationVariable</span> <span>"blog"</span> ())))</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we create a query that might look a little unusual by SQL standards. This is because SQL does not support relation-valued attributes whereas Project:M36 does. In this case, alongside collecting the blog information, we collect all the comments alongside the blog tuple as a nested relation containing a set of all comments for this blog post. With SQL, we would need one query per model or duplicate data with a join whereas we can consolidate our queries into one with Project:M36.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>let</span> render <span>=</span> html <span>.</span> renderHtml
    formatStamp <span>=</span> formatTime defaultTimeLocale (iso8601DateFormat (<span>Just</span> <span>"%H:%M:%S"</span>))

        render <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After retrieving all the data we need for the page in one query, we extract the singleton blog post, if available, and then extract the comments from the relation-valued attribute as well as sort them by timestamp. Finally, we render the blog info, comments, and a comment form where users can add new comments (elided for brevity).</p>
<p>Our final action adds a comment submitted from the previously-rendered form.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>addComment ::</span> <span>SessionId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Connection</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ActionM</span> ()

  <span>case</span> toInsertExpr [<span>Comment</span> {blogTitle <span>=</span> blogid,
                              commentTime <span>=</span> now,
                              contents <span>=</span> commentText }] <span>"comment"</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> handleWebError (<span>Left</span> err)

        <span>Right</span> _ <span>-&gt;</span>
          redirect (TL.fromStrict (<span>"/blog/"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> blogid))</code></pre></div>
<p>We use <code>Tupleable</code>’s <code>toInsertExpr</code> to create a new <code>Comment</code> and insert it into the database. The <code>withTransaction</code> line commits our new comment to the database, if no other errors are raised (such as a constraint or type violation). Finally, we redirect to the blog post page where the user will see his comment added.</p>

<p>Project:M36 offers some unique features for Haskell developers which makes persistence and querying a snap including:</p>
<ul>
<li>full algebraic data type support with normal Haskell data types</li>
<li>easy marshaling between database tuples and Haskell values</li>
<li>relation-valued attributes</li>
<li>a mathematically-sound relational model</li>

<p>Anti-epidemic authorities in north China's Tianjin Municipality are tracing close contacts with ice cream contaminated with the coronavirus after three samples tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>All of the products produced by Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company has been sealed and contained after the company sent the samples to the municipal centre for disease control on Tuesday and Wednesday, which later tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Preliminary epidemiological investigations show that the company produced the batch of ice cream using raw materials including milk powder imported from New Zealand and whey powder imported from Ukraine.</p>
<p>The company's 1,662 employees are currently placed under quarantine and have undergone nucleic acid testing on Thursday following the guidance of the Tianjin Center for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Authorities said the company produced 4,836 boxes of contaminated ice cream, among which 2,089 boxes in storage have been sealed away.</p>
<p>A total of 935 boxes of the ice cream, out of 2,747 boxes that entered the market, were in Tianjin and only 65 boxes were sold to markets.</p>
<p>Authorities advised residents who may have bought the product to report their health and physical movements to their communities.</p>
<p>The city has also notified the market regulation authorities in other provinces where the ice cream was sent so it can be traced.</p>

<p>Up until now, to use a TFT display on the PC110 you need to run a program after boot.   The original method is running CT65535.exe from Taka that  updates the CT65535 registers as required which mostly works well except some XR values can be overwritten if you switch LCD/CRT with the Fn-Key and potentially some mode changes can cause unexpected issues.       I then implemented an alternate method that updates the video bios in shadow memory and soft reboots.  This method is almost as if the settings were from the factory and allows use of the Fn- key for CRT/LCD and ensures that it will work in all modes, however you still cannot enter Easy Setup and the change is lost on hard reboot.   It was not much of an advantage over CT65535.exe, but the method of patching the binary bios image itself was a necessary step leading up to this flash updater.</p>



<p>Now that I have successfully managed to update the flash memory,  I am able to apply the  modifications directly which now allows full use of the system even Easy Setup.</p>



<p>I still need to do some additional work before I can make it available<br></p>



<ul><li>Check that A/C power is connected and Battery is fully charged</li><li>Verify the bios is an expected bios</li><li>Check that no TSR is loaded that can interrupt the process.</li><li>Provide command switches to specify VGA-TFT, WVGA-TFT, DSTN (Origional)</li></ul>

<p>Here is an idea (I had early on and remembered today),   whereby if you  change the brightness quickly multiple times within 2 seconds, it enters into a “custom” brightness mode.   I flash the display 3 times to let you know that this mode has been entered.</p>



<p>A reminder why this could be useful.    The PC110 allows three brightness levels, but only two when on battery power.   So this would be way to access everything from the minimum 1% to the maximum 100% even while on battery power,  if you are not satisfied with the default levels.</p>



<p>I will update the program to have a timer so the brightness of the display does not actually change until no key has been pressed for maybe half a second to avoid the display changing brightness while you are trying to enter “custom” mode.</p>



<p>I still need to take some measurements on current consumption vs light output to decide what the ideal low/medium/high values should be, and what “custom” levels should be included.</p>

</p></figure>







<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><span>Power Default Levels</span></td><td></td><td>milliWatts</td><td>Luminosity</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>10%</td><td>137</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>50%</td><td>809</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High (A/C Power Only)</td><td>100%</td><td>1670</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Custom Levels</span></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1/10</td><td>0%</td><td>0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2/10</td><td>2%</td><td>32</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3/10</td><td>8%</td><td>147</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4/10</td><td>16%</td><td>263</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5/10</td><td>24%</td><td>399</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6/10</td><td>32%</td><td>536</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7/10</td><td>48%</td><td>798</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8/10</td><td>63%</td><td>1061</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9/10</td><td>79%</td><td>1313</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10/10</td><td>100%</td><td>1670</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I obtained the above power measurements by powering the PC110 from a bench power supply at 10.5VDC.  The baseline power consumption was 4000mW with no battery installed and the screen electronics energized but the backlight off. With full backlight on the total consumption was 5600mW.</p>



<p>By comparison the OEM display consumption is 1418mW at low, 1733mW at medium and 2205mW at high.  </p>

<p>In the previous design, I was reading the voltage of PIN3 of the PC110 30pin connector which is the original LCD driving voltage.  It’s range is about 22V to 30V and is controlled by the contrast keys in I believe 256 steps.  I was using two resistors to form a voltage divider to bring 30V down to ~3.3V for the ADC of the PIC.  The problem is,    it can take quite some time to  go from 0% to 100% contrast and even still this only provides a voltage range of ~2.4V to ~3.3V, and the resolution of the ADC is low so the noise is a problem.  The intention had been to have more than the standard (3) brightness levels, however in practice this methods is only useful if a high resolution ADC was used or other analog circuity was put in place to  better scale the signal.</p>



<p>I have revised the PCB to instead use the original brightness signal located on PIN3 of the inverter wire.</p>

<h4>Pinout of 4 pin inverter connector</h4>



<p>PIN1 = ~10.5V (Inverter Supply)<br>PIN2 = GND<br>PIN3 = Brightness Control (25kohm Low, 10.5kohm medium,  5.4kohm full)<br>PIN4 = ENABLE (0V off, ~3.4V ON)</p>



<p>I have placed a 10kohm resistor from PIN3 to Vcc (3.3V),  and the below measured voltage is  as measured at Pin3.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Intensity</td><td>Pin3 Ohms to GND</td><td>Measured Volts</td><td>ADC</td><td>Threshold</td><td>PWM%</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>25k</td><td>2.75</td><td>213</td><td>&lt;255</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>10.5k</td><td>1.75</td><td>135</td><td>&lt;150</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>5.4k</td><td>0.75</td><td>58</td><td>&lt;100</td><td>100%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The low and medium brightness is TBD,  I will try to select the optimal values to pre-program.</p>



<p>High brightness is only available  while connected to A/C.   Although the PC110 has no issue providing the current for the LED backlight, it may have been designed to restrict full brightness on A/C because of the higher draw of the CFL backlight inverter.</p>



<p>Either way, the brightness between medium and high will not but massive in terms of light output,  so it can be considered with this was you can switch between the lowest brightness, and the ideal brightness.</p>

<p>The issue I described as “blue tint” turns out to have been a fault in my test system.  I built another revision of the PCB including  pads for  capacitors, and it would seem I only needed to place a cap on the clock line to resolve the remaining signal integrity issues.   </p>

</p></figure>



<h4>Current Status</h4>







<ul><li>Full VGA Clock (25.175MHz) without any pixel errors / artifacts</li><li>Full brightness control via the contrast keys</li><li>Less than 100µA draw on the 10.5V inverter supply while display is off.</li><li>All electrical load is on the inverter supply wires and not the fpc.</li><li>250mA fuse to reduce risk of blowing the internal 650mA fuse in any unexpected failure modes.   </li><li>Using the Hitachi transceivers maintains same electrical interface to the CT65535 as the OEM display.    This may be an overkill step but it is working well so I am sticking with it. </li></ul>



<h4>Next Steps</h4>







<ul><li>Further verify there are no pixel errors at the higher clock speed.</li><li>Revise the PCB to simplify assembly and clean it up.</li><li>Update the 3d model for the new bezel to accommodate the new PCB.</li></ul>



<h4>Current Revision</h4>

<p>This is just a quick update.    This is more a journal to myself and as always I most say I do not  know what I doing generally,  so consider this as entertainment more than information.</p>



<p>TLDR: I have had some success using the Hitachi level converters and terminating capacitors.  I believe this issue is all about transmission line theory, which I am aware of but do not understand so this is trial and error.  I am  ordering another revision of the board this week and starting to try and finalize the 3D model for the bezel.</p>



<p>I do still notice a blue tint in certain mode tests,   I am not certain this is a hardware issue yet I need to investigate it more once these other issues are sorted out.</p>

<hr>



<p>I continue to chase the goal of being able to drive the replacement display at the full VGA clock speed of 25.175MHz /  ~60hz refresh rate.     </p>



<p>To summarize the issues I have been facing,  in various versions of the PCB’s and hand wiring  there was noise, jitter and other timing issues visible when certain patterns were displayed on the screen.   The effect was not as bad when running at 15MHz but still there. It was terrible with sloppy  handmade boards and  breadboard testing.  </p>



<p>I attempted to fix this with various forms of shielding, however it became clear the the issue was not external noise,  and the reason the the metal back plate improved the situation was due to some kind of inductive coupling or similar effect on the ribbon cable.</p>



<p>I concluded the issue was related to an impedance mismatch causing reflections of the signal.   I looked at what type of  source termination and receiver end termination may have been in place.  </p>



<p>I found that all signals including the clock appear to have a 0ohm resistor between the CT65535 output pin and the FPC connector,  and they are each coupled to ground with a 50pf or so capacitor. On receiving side they went straight into a Hitatchi HD151015 9 bit Level Shifter / Transceiver. </p>



<p>I figured these values and topology were designed based on the length of the path from the CT65535 through to the CSTN at the original clock speed (~8mhz if i recall).</p>



<p>Of course this is no longer the case with the adapter board where two new connectors are introduced,  the traces on the adapter PCB, the ribbon cable on the AT050TN23v1 and then the difference of the input gates/etc on the TFT.</p>



<p>I had various attempts at implementing signal termination at the converter PCB and on the TFT DCLK pin itself with varying success but nothing repeatable.  What would work with test leads would not work once soldered on.   What worked in one orientation would not work in another it was all random.  I believe this may have at least in part been related to trying to terminate in the middle of the transmission line and not close enough to the end.</p>



<p>It had also been observed that lowering the voltage of VCC on the TFT could improve the issue slightly, this was not practical but got me thinking about level converters to address the flight difference the PC110 ~3.5V and the 3.3V of the DC-DC.  I also knew that the immediate input on the OEM display was a Hitatchi level converter.</p>



<p>I purchased every possible level converter I could find on digikey, and generally the results were identical to it not being used at all.  I then tried harvesting the Hitatchi level converters off an old CSTN and suddenly the signal was drastically improved,  but still …</p></div></article></div></section></div></div>

  <p>Have you ever reviewed a code that you've written weeks, months or years ago; and then you realize you do not understand what it's doing? that it's too complex? Then imagine what will be the experience of developers other than you when they will review it!</p> 
  <p>This is a sign of code having poor readability!</p> 
  <h2>Why code readability is important?</h2> 
  <p>There are 2 audiences for any code:</p> 
  <ol>
   <li>The computer that is going to execute that code, once translated to <code>01010</code> by compilers.</li>
   <li>The developers who are going to maintain that code in the programming language it has been written.</li>
  </ol> 
  <p>The purpose of code readability is to help developers to easily read, understand and maintain that code.</p> 
  <p>This is what happens when working with code having poor readability:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>You might misunderstand the code and use it in ways it was not meant to be used.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>You will then spend multiple iterations getting the change right.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Or you might change the code, unintentionally breaking functionality elsewhere.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Overall, you waste more time with such code and it lead a a lot frustrations.&nbsp;Readable code is easy understand and change. This mean we can add new features or fix bugs much faster.</p> 
  <h2>How to make readable code</h2> 
  <p>Look at the following example of code, it extracts all the transactions associated with the event&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;from a CSV file and store them into another CSV file.</p> 
  <pre>class DataExtractor {
  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines;
     try {
        lines = Files.readAllLines(in.toPath());
     } catch (IOException e){
        return 0
     }

     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (columns.size == 4 &amp;&amp; "1".equals(columns[1]){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }

     try {
       Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
     } catch(IOException e){
       e.printStackTrace(System.err);
     }
     return filtered.size();
  }
}</pre> 
  <p>We are going to apply 5 rules to improve the readability of this code.</p> 
  <h2>1. Don't use magic numbers</h2> 
  <p>Magic number are values that are used directly in the code. Instead, you should declare then as constants that you'll use in the code.</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1"

  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     ...
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
     ...
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>2. Simplify your conditional statements</h2> 
  <p><code>if</code> statements having more that 1 conditions should be reduced. Move all the conditions to a private function having a name explaining the conditions evaluated.</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     ...
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
     ...
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>3. Don't handle exceptions</h2> 
  <p>Unless you know what to do with the exception, do not handle them, and let the caller of your function deal with it.</p> 
  <p>In our exemple,&nbsp;<code>extract()</code> is extracting the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;transactions but is also handling <code>IOException</code>. To simplify this function, we are going remove the responsibility of handling exceptions by changing its signature to:</p> 
  <p><code>public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException</code></p> 
  <p>By adding to the declaration <code>throws&nbsp;IOException</code>, we are transferring the responsibility of exception handling to the caller. Now the code is much simpler:</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(in.toPath());

     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }

     Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
     return filtered.size();
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>4. Write short functions</h2> 
  <p>A short function is a function that is reduced the minimal number of instructions.</p> 
  <p>If you look at the <code>extract()</code>, at high level it has 3 blocks of code: read a file, extract read transactions and write to a file. To improve readability if <code>extract()</code>, we will move those 3 blocs of code into private functions</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines = read(in);
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = extract(lines);
     write(extracted, out)
     return filtered.size();
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; read(File in) throws IOException {
     return files.readAllLines(in.toPath());
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; extract(List&lt;String&gt; lines) {
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
  }

  private void write(List&lt;String&gt; extracted, File out) throws IOException {
    Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <p>Note that as we are moving code to functions, we make sure that each of the function do not handle exceptions!</p> 
  <h2>5. Use meaningful names</h2> 
  <p>Name you use for functions of variable are critical to improve the readability of the code. It helps you to understand what the code is doing, without going in the the details of each function.</p> 
  <p>Look at the changes we did in the code:</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; transactions = readTransactions(in);
     List&lt;String&gt; readTransactions = extractReadTransactions(transactions);
     writeTransactions(extracted, out)
     return readTransactions.size();
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; readTransactions(File in) throws IOException {
   ...
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; extractReadTransactions(List&lt;String&gt; lines) {
   ...
  }

  private void writeTransactions(List&lt;String&gt; transactions, File out) throws IOException {
    ...
  }
  ...
}</pre> 
  <hr> 
  <p>Coding is a social activity. When writing your code, other than ensuring that it works, you must always make sure that other developers will be able to read and understand it. Improving code readability leads to simpler code, simpler code is easier to maintain.</p> 
  <p>Readability is one of the most important measure of code quality</p>

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong>Q: What’s the best way to get to a proficient level in a target language quickly?</strong></h2>



<p>A: Create a solid foundation through <strong>study</strong>, <strong>immerse</strong> yourself in native media, <strong>and</strong> <strong>practice</strong> <strong>generating</strong> your own speech and writing based on what you know.  Repeat the process and have joy while doing it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="700" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/study-immersion-generation-triangle.png" alt=""><figcaption>Study, Immersion, Generation — three corners of a triangle for expedient attainment of proficiency in any target language.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At Japanese Complete we focus on creating solutions to target “Study” and “Generation,” while others in the world have been quite successful at creating solutions that target “Immersion.”</p>







<p>For example, our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">innovative online textbook</a> has thorough grammar explanations not available elsewhere, and lessons to learn kanji by meaning-word and mnemonic, with a portion of the page dedicated to practicing your kanji drawing skill.  We also have quizzes for each chapter so you can be sure you are recalling the verbs, kanji, and grammatical particles you have learned in each lesson.</p>



<p><a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=1265">Because Japanese grammar is so different from English</a> and Romance languages, it is vital that one has a very solid foundation upon which to build their understanding.  If one were simply “dropped into Japan” one day out of the blue, it would be an uphill climb in learning the basic grammar through immersion, which is why stepping stones in the very beginning are excellent for speeding up one’s attainment of proficiency.</p>



<h3>Frequency Analysis</h3>



<p>There have been some extensive Frequency Analysis projects of the Japanese language, such as the BCCWJ (Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese) that aim to provide educators with a way to teach the language in a sequence consistent with immediate usefulness, effectiveness, and proportional to occurence in the wild.  For example, the <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/777">most frequent 777 kanji cover roughly 90% of all kanji seen in the wild</a>, while the next 700 (#778-1447) cover just 8%.  This is consistent with Zipf’s law, and Zipf’s insight can readily be brought to language learning by using a frequency-based dictionary or otherwise created frequency-list.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="300" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-graph.png" alt=""><figcaption>Set yourself up for success with a solid foundation based on Frequency Analysis and Research-Based methods.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>“Get your ears wet.” </p>



<p>Free services such as <a href="https://supernative.tv/">Super Native TV</a> allow learners to listen to small clips of real Japanese shows and videos, and even do small quizzes based on listening and filling in the blank — a portion of the original is deleted and one has to type in the correct missing words or letters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-18-at-5.08.17-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="597"><figcaption>SuperNative.TV has a great interface for listening to real Japanese media and practicing your listening and recall.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Browser Extensions</h2>



<p>Other useful pieces for immersion without dunking yourself into the nation of Japan straight-away include browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/">RikaiChamp for Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en">RikaiKun for Chrome</a> that function as dynamic tooltip dictionaries for browsing the web.  Now you can go to a Japanese news site and hover over text to get the definitions from the loaded dictionary files straight into a useful tooltip.</p>



<figure><img src="https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/228/228746.png?modified=1599530672" alt=""><figcaption>Provided Screenshots of RikaiChamp for Firefox.  Rikai means “understanding” or “comprehension.”</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also new projects trying to create a stronger immersion-based environment for daily life on the screen — <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Migaku">Migaku</a> (jp: “to polish”) is a (mostly?) open-source project that, when subscribed to their $5 tier on their Patreon, provides a browser extension that uses loaded dictionary files to define text with tooltips, and also allows one to create flash cards seamlessly within that experience.  There is also the ability to create flash cards from subtitles on Netflix and anything with .srt files so you can create flash cards for snippets from your favorite video and television programs. Although it might be rough around the edges, there are now 3 lads working on it full-time so hopefully it will just get better and better for language immersion in the browser.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1303" height="699" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-18-at-5.28.18-PM.png" alt=""><figcaption>Migaku Browser Extension for creating flash cards while browsing, and for creating flash cards from videos you watch with subtitle files.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>Writing</h2>



<p>The last step of the loop for fluency is <strong>generation</strong>, which occurs when one uses their target language to speak or write.  At Japanese Complete we have created some very interesting tools to aide users in generating grammatical Japanese, such as our tool <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=1099">Wag: the Visual Sentence Composer</a> that lets you build grammatically-correct sentences in Japanese via point-and-click.   </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="845" height="639" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wag-maker-a1.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Visual sentence-composer for Japanese “Wag,” also provides rudimentary translations via tech indistinguishable from magic.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Speaking</h2>



<p>For generating speaking ability, <a href="https://supernative.tv/">supernative.tv</a> has a listen-and-repeat mode.  There are also several services for connecting with language experts and practicing your conversation skills available as apps for mobile devices.  There is also the opportunity to connect with language tutors via video chat and practice one’s speaking abilities this way.</p>



<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>



<p>Create a <strong>solid foundation</strong> through exemplary materials so you waste no time.  This is studying well.</p>



<p><strong>Immerse yourself</strong> in native media as much as possible: news, shows, film, youtube, articles, books, songs, and in the case of Japanese: manga, anime, etc.</p>



<p>Practice <strong>generating language</strong> both verbal and written so you can quickly attain a flexible level of proficiency in your target language.</p>



<p>By finding excellent tools to satisfy each of the three circles of “Study, Immersion, and Generation,” (and using them on repeat) one can swiftly attain fluency in any language.</p>

<p>If you look around the web for reasons why you should learn Racket, or its ancestors Lisp and Scheme, you'll find no shortage of answers. On Racket's official website, it is proudly named the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/"><em>language-oriented programming language</em></a>. For Matthew Butterick, author of <em><a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a></em>, it's Racket's <a href="https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-racket-why-lisp.html"><em>beauty</em> and <em>expressiveness</em></a> that draw him to it. And for others, like programmers Eric Raymond and Paul Graham, it is worth learning for its <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"><em>profound enlightenment</em>,</a> or because it can be used as a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"><em>secret weapon</em>.</a></p>
<p>These are all compelling answers that reflect the truly wide variety of programmers that the Lisp family of languages attract. But none of these are why James Stelly has written his new book, <a href="https://nostarch.com/racket-programming-fun-way"><em>Racket Programming the Fun Way</em></a>. Instead, as its name suggests, Stelly thinks you should learn Racket because it is just plain <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>There's good reason for Stelly's appraisal, as Racket's simple and consistent syntax makes it an ideal language for new programmers, as well as those who are tired of the all-too-similar C-like languages. Out of the box, Racket also includes <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/">DrRacket</a>, a graphical IDE, and boasts a large standard library for creating <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/">GUIs</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">drawings</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/games/index.html">games</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/">math plots</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>At first glance, the book certainly seems to align with this sentiment. Stelly's writing is light and inviting, and the book's playful cover matches the little illustrations and diagrams scattered throughout the text. </p>
<p>After the introductory chapters, which cover the basics of s-expressions, linked lists, lambda functions, and core standard library functions, Stelly begins to build on the foundation he has laid. The next three chapters deal with Racket's graphical capabilities, covering math plots, GUIs, and data visualizations. In all of these, Stelly finds ways to keep the mathematically-inclined reader engaged by introducing some basic concepts in set theory, trigonometry, and statistics. For me, though, the most interesting parts of these chapters come in their respective "applications" sections, where Stelly tiles Fibonacci numbers and implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">the game of Nim</a>, among other diversions.</p>
<p>The book's strongest chapters, however, and the ones that would persuade me to recommend the book to experienced yet curious programmers, come at the end. In these, Stelly addresses graph theory, logic programming, pushdown automata and Turing machines, and finally, lexing and parsing. Importantly, many of these concepts are addressed in a purpose-driven way that is designed to solve problems: implementing depth first search helps Stelly solve Sudoku, while the parsing chapter is centered around building a functional algebraic calculator.</p>
<p>While the more advanced computer science topics addressed in these chapters can seem intimidating, Stelly covers them in a way that does them justice while still being approachable to those without a formal CS education. Even though these topics may not be covered with the same rigor as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">CLRS</a> or <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>, I think the clear diagrams and readable Racket code presented in these sections serve as a great way for those who want to learn more to gain valuable intuition before studying the concepts more in depth.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that I wish Stelly had included more exercises at the end of these chapters, since they are deep topics that warrant more exploring by the reader. It is also disappointing that Stelly did not find any space to include a treatment of Racket <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/macros.html">macros</a>, since they are one of the most unique and powerful features of the language.</p>
<p>Still, <em>Racket Programming the Fun Way</em> is a decidedly fun and informative read that I would recommend both to novice Racket programmers and those who are looking to take a bit of a deeper dive into the language. Stelly's book joins good company alongside <em>Beautiful Racket</em> and <a href="https://htdp.org/"><em>How To Design Programs</em></a> as excellent books on Racket, which can hopefully bring the language to a wider audience in the programming community.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful, astrally-projected depiction of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <em>flow</em> concept. For the unfamiliar, here's how Csikszentmihalyi describes flow, or <em>the optimal experience</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is what the sailor holding a tight course feels when the wind whips through her hair, when the boat lunges through the waves like a colt -- sails, hull, wind, and sea humming a harmony that vibrates in the sailor's veins. It is what a painter feels when the colors on the canvas begin to set up a magnetic tension with each other, and a new <em>thing</em>, a living form, takes shape in front of the astonished creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds pretty good, right? Csikszentmihalyi contends that flow is how we humans can achieve happiness. And it's not something that's given; it's something we have to cultivate and grow and work towards. I cannot recommend his book enough.</p>
<p>Even better was SOUL's depiction of the non-flow state - the lost souls:</p>

<p>Definitely been there. Usually its whenever I hear, "Can you see my screen?" These poor creatures wander the astral plane, lost and unhappy and unsure why.</p>
<p>Luckily, the movie tells us it's never too late, and I believe them.</p>
<p>So, how do we achieve flow?</p>
<p>It's the deliberate combination of skill meeting challenge. More from Csikszentmihalyi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post documents a legitimate flow experience I had last week that began with an observation about my podcast addiction.</p>
<h2>All My Best Friends are Podcasts</h2>
<p>Yes, that's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_63ZZRLylE">Less Than Jake</a> reference. You're welcome, 8th-Grade Charlie.</p>
<p>And, if you're at all like 28th-Grade Charlie, then you're also helplessly addicted to podcasts.</p>
<p>I listen all the time -- while I'm washing dishes, folding laundry, performing my daily Amazon cardboard box cutting ritual, even taking showers. Carly doesn't understand it, and I certainly can't explain it.</p>
<p>Am I that afraid of silence? My own thoughts? Am I so lonely for friendship that I even found this evisceration quietly comforting?</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Podcasts saying literally nothing for 20 minutes. <a href="https://t.co/nmfka1Gjsp">pic.twitter.com/nmfka1Gjsp</a></p>— Jonathan Ogden (@jogdenUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/jogdenUK/status/1346442437376552962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>I know too much about ancient Rome to be able to answer these questions.</p>
<p>So, if I'm just going to accept my Overcast overlords, can I turn the tides on this one-directional relationship?</p>
<p>Yes. We can. Enter: the spark of an idea.</p>
<h2>Create a podcast from the audio of YouTube videos</h2>
<p>If I can't control what my favorite podcast hosts are talking about in any given episode, can I instead choose <em>exactly</em> what I want to listen to? What if there were a virtually unlimited source of content to consume? Surely, I could then be more deliberate in my listening habits.</p>
<p>YouTube is our answer. I've been collecting computer science talks and lectures in playlists that I always mean to "watch later" and never do. Fact is, I don't want to watch a YouTube video. I rarely ever sit down and "watch YouTube" (other than The 8-Bit Guy cleaning old VIC-20s). It's not part of my routine. I'm usually moving around too much.</p>
<p>YouTube also makes it really hard to consume something "on the go." You need to pay for their PiP or minimized mode, I think.</p>
<p>Then I found this <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/02/Creating-a-Podcast-Feed-from-a-YouTube-Playlist/">post by Benjamin Congdon</a>: a simple way to create an audio podcast feed from a YouTube playlist using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3qksZiq">Raspberry Pi</a> home server. His tutorial leverages an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/mxpv/podsync/">PodSync</a>, which itself leverages <code>ffmpeg</code> and, everyone's favorite controversy, <code>youtube-dl</code>, behind the scenes to download audio from YouTube and generate a podcast RSS feed. This, this, is exactly what I was looking for!</p>
<p>Nothing to add here, other than bravo, Benjamin. I was able to follow his tutorial pretty much straight through.</p>
<p>Wait, I do have something to add. Benjamin suggests using <code>rsync</code> to upload your mp3s and xml RSS feed to s3 or the like. I did this initially, but I didn't like the idea of having to mark these files as <code>public</code> on s3 in case of some huge accidental traffic surge.</p>
<p>So I came up with another idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a public repo on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (mine is <a href="https://github.com/rockswhat/listener">here</a>)</li>
<li>Init the repo in your <code>/data</code> directory on the Raspberry Pi (this is the directory with the generated <code>.xml</code> RSS feed and <code>mp3</code> audio files)</li>
<li>Change your Podsync config's hostname to your GitHub Pages site: </li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>hostname = "https://rockswhat.github.io/listener"`</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Change your cron command to push to your repo (instead of <code>rsync</code> to s3):</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/15 * * * * cd /home/pi/podsync/data &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "update feed" &amp;&amp; git push origin main</code></pre></div>
<p>Voila! My own podcast feed of YouTube videos, publicly available on the Internet. You can add my feed to Overcast (or your favorite podcast player) with its XML URL:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://rockswhat.github.io/listener/listen_laterz.xml</code></pre></div>
<h3>C'mon, you really achieved flow from <em>that</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not really, but <em>almost</em>. Tutorials, good ones, at least, are guided paths toward some goal, with micro-feedback and mini-frustrations along the way. And these things are well-suited to flow. They can lead you to flow.</p>
<p>In my case, this tutorial got my gears turning. Which now gets us into to the <code>creative computing</code> side of this article.</p>
<p>I think it's important to remind ourselves to have fun with our computers. To use them to make art, make music, create weird stuff, just because we can. There's so much on our computers and phones now thanks to the Internet that can warp our minds and render us into Lost Souls. We often forget the simple joys of computers of the past, back when they were bicycles for the mind, and used adorable floppy disks or CD-ROM drives for games and encyclopedias. I know there's so much "more" that we can do with computers, but we need to remember that they are here to work for us, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Overcast fill up with audio from my <code>Listen Laterz</code> YouTube playlist, I knew I needed to keep going, to see what else I could render from clay into podcast feeds.</p>
<h2>Creating a podcast audiobook from Project Gutenberg e-books</h2>
<p>Where else can we find a giant repository of open content on the Internet that also happens to be inconvenient to consume?</p>
<p>Hello, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>! </p>
<p>Project Gutenberg is just about the coolest --- and one of the most important -- things on the internet. The fact that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">started on the ARPANET in 1971</a> blows my mind. That is some creative, forward-thinking from its founder Michael S. Hart.</p>
<p>My idea here is simple: pick a public domain book, chop it up into chapters, convert the chapters to audio, and then generate an xml RSS feed.</p>
<p>I picked Mary Shelley's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm">Frankenstein</a>, because, why not? I already read it a few years ago during my October "Spooky Reads" habit, but I figured it's the perfect candidate for re-animation.</p>
<p>If you've clicked the link to the text on Project Gutenberg, you'll see it's a plaintext nightmare. I'm not ashamed to admit here that I manually just chopped it up into separate text files, rather than writing a script to somehow do this for me. Whatever, ok?</p>
<p>First let's make some files.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cd</span> pieces
<span>touch</span> intro.txt
<span>touch</span> letter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>4</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> chapter-<span>{</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>24</span><span>}</span>.txt
<span>touch</span> license.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>And then we copy-pasta.</p>
<p>Now that I've got my chapters (aka future podcast episodes) all set, we're ready to convert them to audio. What's the easiest way I can do that?</p>
<p>My "in-the-zone" brain suggests using the terminal's <code>say</code> command. I've used this command a few years ago in one of my earliest creative computing projects: a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/terminal-man-live-in-nyc">live musical performance from a telepresence robot</a>).</p>
<p>Surely, I can write a neat little script to loop through my text files and <code>say</code> them into an <code>mp3</code>. Some Googling for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501663/macs-say-command-to-mp3">advice</a>, and I've soon got this Bash script going:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> *.txt<span>;</span>
<span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"processing <span>$i</span>..."</span><span>;</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$i</span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>cut</span> -f <span>1</span> -d <span>'.'</span><span>)</span></span>
    say -v Vicki -f <span>$i</span> -o aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
    lame -m m aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff mp3/<span>$name</span>.mp3
    <span>rm</span> aiff/<span>$name</span>.aiff
<span>done</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it works! Checkpoint reached! The <code>mp3</code> files are now sitting happily in their respective <code>/mp3</code> folder. I experience a fleeting moment of joy, and then immediately plunge into the next challenge: generating an XML feed.</p>
<p>My hack-y brain suggests another copy-pasta. Let's take the feed generated by the Podsync library in the section above, replace pieces of it with Bash variables, and then loop through my text files to jam in the values I want.</p>
<p>More googling ensures, including learning a bit more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20here%20document,it%20were%20a%20separate%20file.">heredocs</a>, and I've eventually got this script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div><p>During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. Somone pitched it to me as a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood.</p>

<p>At the time, I was using Linux for school work, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get
university work done on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook">iBook G4</a> and over time became enamoured by the idea of
being a Mac indie developer.</p>

<p>2006 saw the start of the <a href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/">Delicious Generation</a> - a resurgence of new
developers pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and exploring different ways of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist">engaging the Mac users community</a>. Whilst I wasn’t quite focused enough to be
able to contribute apps, that time period left a mark on me. In 2007, I got a
<a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20">student scholarship for WWDC</a> and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could potentially have my career as. It took until 2011 before I started working on
indie Mac apps, and that didn’t last too long due to VISA issues.</p>

<p>I didn’t really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my programming skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community tools community was
really where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.</p>

<p>I never got a job with a focus on the Mac again.</p>

<p>It’s somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple’s new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The Mac isn’t really the right OS for me anymore.</p>

<p>I’m not bitter, things have just changed since I first made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed,
and so have Apple’s. That’s OK.</p>

<h3 id="the-mac-is-for-ios-users">The Mac is for iOS Users</h3>

<p>I think it’s great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now and access them as first-class citizens. I think
it’s great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more in line with iOS. People with
iPhones are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple’s financial reports
(today the Mac is 8% of all Apple profit, and a generally shrinking %.)</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-3q-2020-results-11-25b-profit-on-59-7b-revenue-4-for-1-stock-split-announced.2248022/"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/N7MLkfnlwvkle7Xs2CSzK7f2Myc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/01/1q20_earnings_line_labels.jpg" alt="https://images.macrumors.com/t/N7MLkfnlwvkle7Xs2CSzK7f2Myc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/01/1q20_earnings_line_labels.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The Mac reaps benefits of all sorts from the halo effect of iOS’s stunning growth (more engineers, more eyes on the
platform, shared tooling). It’s also the only platform for making iOS apps, and Apple cares about it.</p>

<p>The bit that’s tricky for me is that I don’t use a phone, and I want my computer to be more like a truck than a car.</p>

<p>I don’t find a phone to be a useful device for me. When I’m not at a computer I don’t want to be instantly available to
others, nor do I use a phone as a media consuming device. It’s hard enough to find a life balance with my code
contributions without another place to get pings from.</p>

<p>That means that roughly the last 5 years of Mac changes have passed me by. Desktop OSes are mature, and so Apple has
prioritised a lot of porting iOS features, APIs and building syncing systems between them. Again, lots of cool stuff for
most folks, but not pushing the Mac, it’s pushing the consumer device ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="progressively-more-restricted-computing">Progressively more restricted computing</h3>

<p>It’s unlikely Apple will ever truly force an App Store only system on the Mac. However, that doesn’t mean that the
incentives aren’t there for apple both financially (because Apple gets a 15-30% cut of all transactions) or from a
security perspective (Mac apps have a stricter sandbox and can be trusted more by users.)</p>

<p>Inside Apple, I bet keeping the Mac a good general purpose computer is a constant uphill battle.
<a href="https://sigpipe.macromates.com/2020/macos-catalina-slow-by-design/">The</a>
<a href="https://medium.com/rocknnull/xcode-8-plugins-alcatraz-the-end-of-an-era-ea6e63617d14">screws</a>
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">keep</a> on
<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html">tightening</a> .</p>

<p>I must stress, for nearly every Mac user these are good things. They don’t want a fully general purpose computer. For
most folks a web browser, a useful file-system and their own edge-case purpose apps provide all they need.</p>

<p>The move towards a more app-store focused, sandboxed OS means that whole genres of apps aren’t possible anymore. I’m
particularly sad about what happened to Safari extensions over the
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/01/safari-14-added-webextensions-support-so-where-are-the-extensions/">last few years</a>.
I don’t want to put my time into a platform where the people starting today work in an increasingly smaller domain.</p>

<h3 id="native-is-less-valuable">Native is less valuable</h3>

<p>The last decade of focus on mobile by everyone has drastically reduced the value of writing a native app for a single
platform. The Mac has kinda been hit the hardest by this in my opinion. Mac software used to be about HIG conformance,
consistent design and interaction models - all of which tended to come at a pretty expensive price.</p>

<p>The Mac software ecosystem was like a street of local shops run by people in the community, and then post-iPhone all the
big shops moved in because they just wanted to make sure they were represented in the area. Modern desktop environments
now feel quite same-y, but this also trivialized OS switching costs.</p>

<p>The rise of Electron being the most <em>accessible</em> developer environment for desktop OSes has meant that all sorts of apps
are available on all platforms. They’re performant enough, and far more importantly <em>they actually exist</em>. You have to
have a lot of resources to ship a Website, Windows App, Mac App, iOS App and Android app just to somewhat be where your
users are.</p>

<p>Unless your company builds an app for just one platform, it’s just not worth the engineering investment to make
something work amazingly for each platform. In part that’s the initial cost, but the maintenance is also a long term
pain because OSes do re-designs or change the underlying tech. At Artsy we used to think it’d be roughly 1 month per
year in just keeping up with iOS updates, imagine that but also per platform and you’re struggling to even stand still.</p>

<p>Using something like Electron, and to some extent React Native, and you get to skip a lot of the OS update rat-race and
just work on a stable platform that runs across many OSes. Any engineer can create a feature that works across all
platforms. On top of that you get to use the world’s most popular programming language (JS) and UI toolset (HTML/CSS) to
make your apps.</p>

<p>These incentives means a lot of the apps I use today are all cross-platform Electron apps: VS Code,
Slack/Discord/Matrix, Spotify, Keybase/Signal</p>

<p>As the Mac software market gets harder to make money in, a few of the native apps I used have also moved to be
subscription services. This is in large part due to the app store de-valuing software (can’t pay for software updates,
you realistically have to keep providing updates for OS changes, trial system barely exists, people have lower
price-point expectations due to iOS’ scale) but sometimes due to these apps wanting to build and provide syncing systems
to account for mobile devices.</p>

<p>I’m all for paying money for applications, I especially like “pay for x months of updates” but generally subscriptions
are a trap to me. Which has meant independently of switching platforms, I’ve moved off more native software over the
last few years.</p>

<p>I do think there’s still a space for optimized native single platform software on the desktop (Sketch, Paw, Pixen, Nova
and Screenflow being great examples) but they are progressively becoming more and more niche.</p>

<p>Apple knows this, and the Mac has slowly become a better platform for time-cheap iOS ports in the last 2 releases.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The point is not that the Mac is terrible, or that the ecosystem is dying etc. I don’t think that. It’s that the bits of
the Mac that kept me tied to it (building native apps for a living, a cohesive well designed UI, specific applications
which I use daily) don’t have the same pull as they once did. These used to be great trade-offs against the
closed-source nature of the OS/apps, and Apple’s occasional devrel hiccups.</p>

<p>So 2020 became the start of looking for alternatives. The result being <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> which
seems to be ticking all of the things I want. It’s well designed by a small team, they seem to be focused on providing a
cohesive OS by building all of the main apps for the OS and has the added bonus of being easy to contribute to. I’d love
to be able to put some time into fixing some of my papercuts with the OS.</p>

<p><img src="https://elementary.io/images/screenshots/desktop.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="its-elementary">It’s elementary</h3>

<p>In a way, elementary OS is like using an older build of macOS
(<a href="https://blog.elementary.io/introducing-elementary-os-5-1-hera/">elementary OS 5</a> feels a lot like macOS Snow Leopard,
with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/updates-for-july-2020/">6’s feature-set</a> echoing macOS Lion). This might sound like a
insult to elementary, but honestly I can’t remember what’s new in the Mac anymore because I don’t really use the new
features.</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot of modern features you may be used to that aren’t on elementary OS, but the features that make you
productive as an engineer are. There’s a great terminal, web browser, file manager and your key IDE apps are likely
cross-platform by this point. Keyboard shortcuts work solidly. Almost all of my hardware worked out of the box.</p>

<p>I’ve not done a hard switch, probably never will, my laptop still runs macOS and I have a Mac Pro still around - there’s
no need to junk them, but I’m competent in using Linux as my daily driver.</p>

<p>I think moving to an OS which I can contribute to, and especially elementary OS which is <em>mainly</em> contributed to by a
few individuals using the same toolchain, is something I can do now. I’m really interested in diving more into the OS,
all of the apps seem to be built in a straightforward way and I’ve found a way to write native GTK applications with
TypeScript to scratch my own itches. Hopefully the write-up next year will include a discussion on how that’s gone.</p>

<h3 id="migration-pattern">Migration Pattern</h3>

<p>Roughly my route to switching first was about making long-term changes to my Mac usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Move to electron apps, or cross platform alternatives. For example I switched from 1Password to Enpass, Sketch to
Figma, Apple Music to Spotify, Apple TV to Netflix, Safari to Firefox etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to a non-Apple keyboard/mouse. The non-native feel of Apple products on other OSes will give you constant
uncanny valley. I use a Logitech “MX Keys” keyboard, and “MX Vertical” mouse and they’re great. If you’re bold you
could try …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
