<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7c080239" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>The light path node in Blender has always been mysterious to me. While I have found it useful, many times I have not fully understood what it does or how it does it. To finally demystify it, I studied it a bit to learn how it works.</p><p>Hopefully, this article can help you learn what I learned about the light path node quicker.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the light path node in Blender? As we render, rays are cast into our 3D scene from the camera. As these rays bounce around in our scene, they get tagged as different types of&nbsp;rays. The light path node allow us to access this data and manipulate our material based on these ray types.</strong></p><p>I have limited this article to only discuss the different ray types and corresponding outputs on the light path node. This is the seven first inputs in the node.</p><h2>What is the light path node?</h2><p>The light path node is a node that we can use when creating materials for Cycles or Eevee in Blender. It is more feature rich when used in Cycles, but some outputs from this node is also usable in Eevee.</p><p>We will explain the node from a Cycles perspective since it is easier to understand the underlying concepts that we need to know about using the light path node effectively.</p><p>The light path node can seem mysterious at first. But what it enables us to do is to break the physics of how materials behave based on how we see the material.</p><p>That is mysterious&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>For example, we can say that when a material is viewed through a mirror, it will look different from when we view it directly.</p><p>We can also use the node for performance optimizations or to change the color of shadows and improve our glass materials by combining glass with transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand how it works, we have to understand something about render engines. Therefore, we will start with a somewhat simplified explanation of a render engine itself, and we will use Cycles as the example.</p><h2>How does a ray tracer work?</h2><p>Cycles is a ray-traced engine. This means that to figure out what color each pixel should have in the final image we shoot rays from the position of each pixel into our 3D scene and let them bounce around and gather data about geometry, materials and lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>We shoot many rays for each pixel since they often bounce in random directions, and we need a large enough sample count to approximate the color each pixel should have.</p><p>As a ray bounce around in the scene, it will hit different things. We call each hit a bounce. On each bounce, a few things are tested.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those things that are tested is what we hit. Geometry? A light? Maybe the background.</p><p>In most cases we will probably hit geometry. If we hit geometry, the material for that surface will be analyzed. Depending on the components of that material, the ray will behave in different ways.</p><p>If it is mainly a diffuse material, it may bounce in a random direction. But there may be some glossy component making a certain number of the rays shot bounce in a more predictable outgoing angle.</p><p>As a ray bounce around, the ray itself also carries some information. The information we care about is what kind of ray it is. But also the ray travel distance or how many bounces it made so far.</p><p>Depending on where the ray is coming from it has one or more tags attached to it telling us what kind of ray it is. A ray can be one, or multiple types of rays at the same time.</p><p>We know that we send many rays for each pixel that bounce around in our scene. What this means is that we send light rays from the position of the camera rather than the lamp. This is a key element to understand.</p><p>As we continue to explore ray types and what we can do with them, we will also explore how we gather information with a ray and what information comes from where. In short, we gather information for each bounce.&nbsp;</p><p>But only rays that are shot from a certain pixels’ perspective can contribute to that pixels color. That is another key piece of information.</p><p>If a ray hits geometry, the material is analyzed, and the ray behaves according to the material node tree.</p><p>Rays get tagged differently depending on the last surface they hit.</p><p>We will now explore each ray type in more detail in the order they are listed on the light path node.</p><h3>Camera ray</h3><p>When we shoot a ray from the camera, we consider it a camera ray. That means that all rays start out as camera rays.</p><p>We can also say that a ray is tagged as a camera ray when we can see something directly.</p><p>When the ray hit something, producing the first bounce, it drops the camera tag and picks up a new tag depending on what it hits.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at an example:</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1158" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDExNTgiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExNTgiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMDhfMTdfa0dQSGcucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTE1OCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Here, the camera sees the blue object directly. The rays coming from the camera uses the lower socket of the mix shader since “is camera ray” is true, translating to the value 1.&nbsp;</p><p>When we analyze the floor though, we can see that the bounce light from the cube is green. Something to be aware of here, is that the pixels on the floor don’t get a green tint because a camera ray first hit the cube and then carries information with it to the floor.</p><p>Instead, it is the rays we cast directly onto the floor that then bounce to the cube that gives the green tint. As the rays come from the camera and bounce on the floor, they drop the camera ray and become diffuse rays since the floor is a white diffuse material.</p><p>As some rays then hit the cube, the material is analyzed and since the incoming ray is not a camera ray the “is camera ray” is false and the green diffuse shader gets returned instead of the blue one.</p><p>A key takeaway here is that a ray does not hit and take material information with it to its next destination. Instead, it bounces and sends information back to previous points it hit.</p><p>If the rays was cast from the light, the flow of information would be reversed from the rays perspective, and we would bring information to the next bounce until we reached the camera and could display the correct color for the given&nbsp;pixel.</p><p>This can be a bit confusing since we often talk about the bounce light as coming from the light hitting the cube and bouncing off the floor and into the camera, like it does in the real world. But in cycles, it is the opposite. We bounce on the floor, land on the cube, and send information back to the spot on the floor to get the correct color for the pixel showing this area.</p><p>Make sure you understand why the indirect light on this cube is green and in what direction the rays are traveling before you continue reading. It can get very tricky to understand other ray types if we are not clear about this.</p><p>We are just about to enter the next piece of complexity, the shadow ray. You see, each bounce splits the ray into an additional ray called a shadow ray.</p><h3>Shadow ray</h3><p>When a ray bounces, a shadow ray is split off from the original ray. The shadow ray is a simpler ray that always bounce toward a random light source instead of taking the material into account.</p><p>If the ray can hit the light directly, we know that the spot we bounce from is directly lit by this light source. However, if we can’t connect directly to the light, we are in shadow from this light.&nbsp;</p><p>With enough shadow rays and the information about each light, we can learn how much light hit each spot in our scene.</p><p>So how can we use a shadow ray and what can we do with it in our material? Well, we can color our shadows.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1066" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEwNjYiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNjYiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMzJfMjRfNGRDNGEucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTA2NiIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>To change the color of a shadow using the shadow rays, we use the transparent BSDF shader to tint or completely change the color of a shadow.</p><p>We can also use a texture with our transparent shader.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1109" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDExMDkiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExMDkiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMzNfNTZfY2ZsRGkucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTEwOSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>So how does this work? We can say that the light path node changes how an object look to its surrounding.</p><p>In our camera ray example, the cube looks blue to the camera ray. But to the floor, the cube looks green.</p><p>For our shadow ray the cube looks transparent and therefore contributes to the color of the shadow. If we set the transparent BSDF to white, the cube will be fully transparent to the shadow ray and therefore won’t cast a shadow.</p><p>You can also try to use a glass shader to see how the shadow change if the cube is viewed as glass by the shadow.</p><p>Let’s now continue to the diffuse and glossy ray even if we kind of covered diffuse already.</p><h3>Diffuse and glossy ray</h3><p>So, we just expanded our view on rays by saying that an object with a light path node in its material can look different to it’s surrounding based on the incoming ray. This means that a diffuse material may view this object in one way while viewed directly by the camera it may look very different.</p><p>Same for the shadows rays even if we need to introduce some kind of transparency to see a real effect here.</p><p>We earlier also explored the diffuse ray, and it is pretty&nbsp;easy to understand as long as we know the direction of the ray and how information travels back from one bounce to another.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1315" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEzMTUiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMTUiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDNfMDJfMTJfMzRfNDRfVXFMeVYucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTMxNSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The materials we have here are sharp and glossy. Meaning roughness set to 0 on the left side, a rough glass surface on the right side and a glass material in the middle.</p><p>It may come as no surprise that both glossy surfaces become green. But what about the glass shader? The glass shader actually&nbsp;contains a glossy component. Remember how we said that light rays may carry more than one “ray type”. The glass shader is such an example. It carries both a “glossy ray” tag and a “transmission ray” tag.</p><p>We covered the diffuse ray as we looked at the camera ray. But we never tested the diffuse ray output from the light path node. Therefore, I just changed from the glossy ray in the example above to the diffuse ray to show you what it looks like.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1315" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEzMTUiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMTUiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDNfMDJfMTJfMzRfNDRfVXFMeVYtMS5wbmciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTAyNCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMzE1IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>You can see that the only place we have diffuse rays is when a ray bounce on the floor up on the cube, sampling data and use that information to determine the indirect color of the floor.</p><h3>Singular reflection and transmission rays</h3><p>The ray types we have left to learn about are singular reflection and transmission.</p><p>Before we continue here, keep in mind that these ray types are only available in Cycles and not in Eevee.</p><p>We will start with the singular ray.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bb49bdb516c4ad0f99fa5fc3909b4f5caf8d5253/1dd14/images/uploads/ad-test-results-2.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

In so many ways, a remarkable piece of engineering.  Efficient, comfortable, and not so bad in the cargo territory.  In it’s plugin form, it can run 20-25 miles on pure EV power, and after that, it still chugs along at 40mpg.  For people wanting to dip their toes into the electric vehicle world, it’s not a bad place to start, assuming you’re okay with the styling.</p><p>With all that, what the HELL went wrong when they ‘designed’ the dashboard and the information systems?  </p><p>I’m rarely speechless when it comes to engineering projects, particularly ones backed by such a well respected and successful company as Toyota.  But jumpin jehosephat.  Who the heck designed the dashboard?  It’s… it’s… nnnnng…. well… let me show you.</p></div>



<h2>The Dashboard – An Introduction</h2>



<p><br>First, lets take a look at the interior.  This is the 2019 Prius Prime dashboard, directly from Toyota’s brochure…</p>



<figure><a href="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg 1024w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-300x161.jpg 300w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-768x411.jpg 768w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1536x823.jpg 1536w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-2048x1097.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Now before I go straight to the jugular, lets note a few positive aspects here.</p>



<ul><li>A large, centrally located touchscreen.  I like that.  It’s easy to reach, everyone in the car can see it, it’s bright and visible. </li><li>The steering wheel has easy to reach controls, right under the thumbs.  Nice.</li><li>The upper display (directly in front of the window) has 3 smaller screens that can show a variety of information panels.  The most obvious one is a speedometer, but the other options are battery usage, mileage, map directions, etc.  As compared to the Tesla, which puts everything on one display in the middle of the car, these secondary displays that ALWAYS display certain information is a nice touch.</li></ul>



<h2>Well, that’s nice, but what’s your beef?</h2>



<p>Sounds all peachy so far, right?  I mean, it looks all shiny and clean, so what’s wrong?</p>



<p>Turns out, plenty.</p>



<p>Lets start at the meta level.  That big central display?  It only controls a small subset of the car systems.  It’s a bad design to have to go hunting for an external button or switch or toggle or display to get a basic function that the display should have on it.</p>



<p>Another problem with the central display are the buttons on the glass on either side.  Those are flush contacts.  You have to look at them to determine if you’re pushing them, and there’s no feedback when you do.  Talk about distracted driver problems.  No feedback contact buttons should be used VERY CAREFULLY in motor vehicles.  Why some of these buttons are glass and others in the car are standard switches, I have no idea.</p>



<h2>Okay, but lets hear the real fails.</h2>



<p>Okay, you asked for it, lets start running down some absolutely batshit decisions made on this car.</p>



<ol><li>Lets start simple.  Seat heaters.  Everyone loves ’em, right?  Took us literally googling and watching youtube videos to figure out how to turn them on.  The controls for the seat heaters are tucked under the dash, on either side of the central console.  Once I scrunched down in the seat, bent my head to one side, I was able to see them.  My wife, who is a foot and a half shorter than I am, never saw them either.  Who thought this was the appropriate placement for these switches?</li><li>Remember those little screens under the front windshield?  Nice, aren’t they?  Well, they are configurable.  You can change what each one shows.  At some point, my wife brought up “Hey, that middle display used to show how much battery time I had left, now it doesn’t.  How do you change that?” – I, a systems engineer, could absolutely not figure out how to change those displays.  The answer?  Tap the right arrow on the steering wheel right control pad.  No other feedback that this is how to do this – no menus, no prompts, no information – I had to google this one too.  There’s nothing on that nice big central display that lets you configure these smaller displays.  They are completely separate.</li><li>At one point we were driving around at night, and I was wondering why the central screen was so bright.  Most cars switch into ‘night mode’ when it gets dark, but this screen was blazing white.  Going through all the menus, I found a screen setting for ‘DAY MODE’ ON/OFF – what exactly that means is sort of a mystery.  There was no NIGHT MODE ON/OFF.  Just that one toggle.  Turns out, you need to use the OTHER screen control.  The one on the left side of the steering column around knee height.  There’s a dial there that on older cars would set the brightness of the dashboard instruments.  Some bright engineer at Toyota decided that if that little knob was spun to a certain point, the central console would always be in day mode.  the DAY MODE apparently can override this setting?  Who knows – but having to go off-screen to some random control when the option should have been RIGHT THERE on the screen is definitely a fail.</li><li>Backup beeper.  Did you know the Prius has a backup beeper?  Going by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-up_beeper">Wikipedia</a> : <quote>A back-up beeper, also known as back-up alarm or vehicle motion alarm, is a device intended to warn passers-by of a vehicle moving in reverse. They typically produce 1000 Hz pure tone beeps at 97-112 decibels.[1] Matsusaburo Yamaguchi of Yamaguchi Electric Company, Japan, invented the back-up beeper. It was first manufactured as model BA1 in 1963.[2] ISO 6165 describes “audible travel alarms”, and ISO 9533 describes how to measure the performance of the alarms</quote><p>Great idea, right?  Except the Prius backup beeper SOUNDS INSIDE THE CAR.  Not externally.  You can’t hear it outside.  Who exactly is this supposed to be warning?</p></li><li>The mapping software sucks.  I mean, you just can’t get around it.  It’s cumbersome, it’s painful to use, the search functions are absolute shit, and it’s just a nightmare to try and use productively.  Took us another zillion years to figure out how to turn off the turn by turn navigation (you can’t except via a buried setting – makes listening to music really terrifying – why can’t you just say ‘turn off turn by turn for now, I’m listening to something cool, I don’t need the interruptions telling me that I’ll be on this interstate until the heat death of the universe.’</li><li>Most functions are disabled while in motion.  This seems to carry over from day 0 of cars getting anything more complicated than an FM stereo head unit.  Someone somewhere said “We should disable any function that may be a distraction to the driver, with no option to get around it”, and so it was.  But, what if you’re traveling in a modern vehicle that thoughtfully placed the navigation system between the driver and passenger seat, where the passenger has the same access as the driver, wouldn’t it make sense to allow the passe… NOPE!  Locked out!  You can’t modify your route or destination or settings while in motion.  DENIED.</li></ol>



<h2>Denoument</h2>



<p>I’m sure I’ll be adding to this list as more things come up.  What’s bothersome about all this is so much of this can be fixed in software.  But as far as I can tell, Toyota is following the auto manufacturer trend of assuming once a model year of a car is complete, so is the software, and it doesn’t need to change.  They may do minor tweaks and fixes, but they do not actually revise the systems with major improvements (unlike Tesla, who put out <a href="https://www.teslafi.com/firmware.php">major software updates pretty much constantly</a>, frequently adding new features or overhauling others).  </p>



<p>It may sound like I’m bashing Toyota and ignoring flaws in other manufacturers.  That’s not the case at all.  I’ve written in the past about <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2019/09/02/ev-cars/everything-wrong-with-my-tesla-model-3-performance/">my issues with the Tesla Model 3</a>, and while I didn’t have a lot of complaints about my <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/05/09/geekitude/one-week-with-the-chevy-volt/">Chevy Volt</a>, there were some <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/07/30/hacks/ownstar-vulnerability-in-onstar-application-for-gm-vehicles/">frustrations with GM</a>.  (In fact, I had some UX problems with the Volt as well, but the Volt didnt’ have the big touchscreen that SHOULD have made those problems easy to fix.)</p>



<p>Modern car manufacturers absolutely need to get on board, and stop thinking of the dashboard with a touchscreen as just a ‘shiny’ version of the old knobs and dials dashboards.  It’s a fully functioning digital information and control system, and should be treated as such, with regular updates, and some put into UX design.  Tesla is the only company that is doing this right.  What the heck is everyone else thinking?</p>

      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

			<p><i>Happy Holidays. This week we are reprinting our top stories of 2020. This article first appeared online in our “Energy” issue in June, 2020.</i></p><p><span>D</span>ear Bella,</p><p>I’m going to imitate Rudyard Kipling and tell you a just-so story. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the world 100 years ago. He wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i>. And also <i>Just So Stories</i>, which began as bedtime stories he told his daughter Josephine. They were about how animals got their famous features, like the camel’s hump and the leopard’s spots. Kipling was a wonderful writer but he made up his animal stories. My story is based on science, which means many people, through many recent experiments, have concluded things might “just so” be the way of this story.</p><p>It’s also a story about evolution, which is nature’s research and development department. Like Kipling, I’ve given a human voice to certain things: Bacteria form committees and petition the research and development department for answers to their problems, as do plants and dinosaurs. And the R&amp;D department (which is to say, evolution) tries to come up with solutions. I’m going to call evolution “Mr. R&amp;D.” When he finds a problem, Mr. R&amp;D tests things out in different ways to come up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions have unforeseen consequences. So here we go!</p><blockquote><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. But why did dinosaurs have them?</p> </blockquote><p>Once upon a time, on a cold day in January, I was jogging through Regent’s Park in London, stepping carefully through flocks of geese, seagulls, pigeons, and ducks surrounding the boating lake. But, perhaps because of the book I had just been reading (Nick Lane’s <i>Oxygen</i>) my eye picked out a couple of geese that were strangers in this flock: Bar-headed geese, a boy and a girl.<br></p><p>But what were they doing in London in January? During the winter, they usually live in the middle of India, and in the summer they live in Kazakhstan or Mongolia. If you look at a map of the Earth, you can see the barrier between Kazakhstan and India is the Himalayan Mountain Range, the tallest in the world. Every year, millions of bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas and have been doing so for millions of years. They have been seen flying at 28,000 feet. They have flown over Mount Everest! How do they do that?</p><p>The answer seems to be that bar-headed geese, like all birds—hummingbirds, ostriches, pigeons—have super-efficient lungs. It makes our lungs—and the lungs of all mammals—look primitive. I’m sure when birds get together they gossip about how pathetic our lungs are!</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17339_169ea72d893b7bfe6a36b531a78b48af.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BIG AIR:</strong> Dinosaur’s lungs were so efficient that when oxygen levels rose over tens of millions of years, they were able to get very big—bigger than land mammals like elephants have ever gotten, or ever could get.</span><span>VectorPlotnikoff / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>All mammals, including us, breathe in through the same opening that we breathe out. Can you imagine if our digestive system worked the same way? What if the food we put in our mouths, after digestion, came out the same way? It doesn’t bear thinking about! Luckily, for digestion, we have a separate in and out. And that’s what the birds have with their lungs: an in point and an out point. They also have air sacs and hollow spaces in their bones. When they breathe in, half of the good air (with oxygen) goes into these hollow spaces, and the other half goes into their lungs through the rear entrance. When they breathe out, the good air that has been stored in the hollow places now also goes into their lungs through that rear entrance, and the bad air (carbon dioxide and water vapor) is pushed out the front exit. So it doesn’t matter whether birds are breathing in or out: Good air is always going in one direction through their lungs, pushing all the bad air out ahead of it.<br></p><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs! When I was growing up in the 1940s, there was a category in biology called Aves, which meant birds. But scientists have now folded Aves into a category called Dinosauria, and those dinosauria, like pigeons and seagulls and geese, are flying all around us today. If you want to know what a dinosaur probably tasted like, eat some chicken!</p><blockquote><p>Plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this.</p> </blockquote><p>So, dinosaurs had this super-efficient lung system, and they successfully strode the Earth as the dominant species, starting around 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid crashed into Mexico and most of them went extinct. Except for birds. But why did dinosaurs have this super lung system in the first place?<br></p><p>To answer that, we have to go way back, to when plants came out of the ocean onto land, about 450 million years ago. Earlier than that, plant life lived only in the ocean: The surface of the Earth was a desert.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, some pioneer plants got together and said, “Let’s go!” and migrated up onto land. But once the plants got out of the water, they discovered something they never had to deal with in the ocean: gravity. In the ocean, if you’re a plant, you can just float, because the density of a plant is not that different from water. Out of the ocean, the density of a plant is much greater than air, and so gravity can pull it down.</p><p>So for many tens of millions of years, plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this, and decided to form a committee to request an exemption from Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello. What’s your problem?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Our problem is gravity. We never had to deal with it in the ocean, and it’s a problem for us on land.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Why is gravity a problem for you?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: We want to do what we did in the ocean, which is absorb lots of sunlight, and the best way to do that is to have a long stalk, and then to have branches with leaves at the end of the branches and maximize our potential to absorb sunlight.</p> <p><b>MR. R&amp;D</b>: I understand what you want, but it will take me some time. Come back in a million years or so.</p> <p><i>The plants twiddle their thumbs for a million years.</i></p> <p><b>PC</b>: OK, a million years is up! Did you manage to discover something?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Yes, let me see, I think I have it in the drawer. Here it is: lignin.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: What’s lignin?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: It’s a rigid molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. If you absorb it into the cells of your body, it will interact with the molecules of floppy cellulose you already have, and this will create a very firm structure that will allow your cells to become like bricks. You can then stack one cell upon the other, and you can go as high as you want.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: How high?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Over 300 feet.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Wow!</p> <p>So the plants happily swallowed the lignin, and sure enough, it worked exactly as Mr. R&amp;D said, and within a short time stalks, trunks, branches, roots, leaves began popping up all over the Earth.</p> <p>The only problem was that when one of these trees reached the end of its natural life, bacteria and fungal spores got ready to decompose it, sharpening their knives. But when they got to the lignin, their knives stuck: They couldn’t digest the lignin. The very thing that made lignin strong defeated the bacteria and fungi back then. So, they did what we do when we eat a chicken dinner: They ate all the meat and left the bones, which is to say: the lignin.</p><p>Eventually another tree would die and fall on top of the first, and then the same thing would happen again, and another and another, and it kept going like this for hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions of years. In the end, over 100 million years of dead trees and ferns and undigested lignin were deposited under the surface of the Earth. We call the time when most of this happened the Carboniferous (carbon-making) age.</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17341_c9dcf2529a5f4bf66234540fbe60b74e.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BUG OUT:</strong> Around 300 million years ago, there was so much oxygen that insects, who have inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies (seen here in a lifesize model in Italy) had a wingspan of about three feet.</span><span>life_in_a_pixel / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember how evolution sometimes has unforeseen consequences? Well, this deposit of lignin produced an oxygen surge in the atmosphere. Because for every hydrocarbon atom that goes into the Earth, an oxygen atom is not used up in the decay process. Massive amounts of carbon (lignin) were going into the Earth, so massive amounts of oxygen were building up in the atmosphere. Today, oxygen is 21 percent of the atmosphere. But around 300 million years ago, oxygen was well over 30 percent. There was so much oxygen that insects, who have very inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies had a wingspan of three feet, millipedes were eight feet long. Amphibians—frogs and such—also have inefficient lungs, and they were able to get as big as dining room tables.<br></p><p>The microorganisms of the time eventually became aware of this surge in oxygen. The insects and the amphibians didn’t seem to care, because they were dependent on that rich source of oxygen. So the now-worried microorganisms got their committee (MC) together and went to see Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello, what I can do for you?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: We think there is a dangerous situation developing, because oxygen levels have gotten higher every year and they might now be at 35 percent.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: So?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: With indigestible lignin, there is nothing to keep it from continuing to go up.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: I see your point, because at 43 percent a lightning strike will cause the entire atmosphere to ignite since it is so high in flammable oxygen. And the whole experiment of life on Earth will be over. Yes, I agree we have to do something. Give me a million years and I’ll see what I can do.</p> <p><i>For a million years, oxygen levels continue to rise. The even more worried microorganisms come back to Mr. R&amp;D.</i></p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: The bad news is I don’t have anything physical to give you. But I can give you a koan.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What’s that?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: A koan is something you can think of that will help you in …</p></div></div>

<p>Pijul for VS Code is an extension for Visual Studio Code which adds integration with Pijul as a source control management system.</p>
<p>Why develop my own extension instead of contributing to the existing one? It didn't even occur to me to check if one already existed
when I started, and when I did my own extension had enough distinct features to set it apart.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>At present, this extension offers <em>most</em> of the basic features necessary for local Pijul development on a single channel. It includes basic
commands for initializing a repository in a VS Code workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, Reset, or Record one, some, or all of the files in the Pijul Repository.</li>
<li>Decorations in the file tree indicating the current state of each file.</li>
<li>VS Code comparison integration for diffing files with their last recorded versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else still needs to be done on the command line.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requires an existing Pijul installation. <a href="https://pijul.org/manual/installing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instructions for installing Pijul can be found here</a>.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the Source Control View, deleted files show up as their parent directory (This is the result of a Pijul CLI limitation)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code hasn't been published on the extension marketplace yet, so it needs to be built and installed from the source.
To do so, folloow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Install Visual Studio Code Extensions (VSCE)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>npm install -g vsce
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Package the extension</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>vcse package
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." to install the VSIX file you created in the last step </li>
</ol>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>With the eventual goal of releasing on the Extension Marketplace with the same level of quality as other source control extensions,
there are a number of areas which will require a great deal of further refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper handling of VS Code workspaces with multiple folders</li>
<li>Automatic detection of Pijul installations</li>
<li>More robust .ignore file handling</li>
<li>Greater configurability</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of Pijul features which still need implementation to reach a publishable minimum viable product, suitable for local Pijul development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amending changes</li>
<li>Moving and removing files</li>
<li>Ignore file mangagement</li>
<li>Basic change log</li>
<li>Basic channel management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long term, I would like to offer more in-depth Pijul integration, with the goal of providing a better experience than can be offered on the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote management</li>
<li>Inline <code>pijul credit</code> annotations</li>
<li>IntelliJ style changeset system</li>
<li>Splitting/Combining existing changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category probably could probably fit a couple more points that I haven't thought of.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code welcomes all contributions. Before contributing, please be sure to add the following hook to your Pijul config file:</p>
<pre><code>[hooks]
record = ["yarn run lint --fix"]
</code></pre>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Global Unique Identifiers</a> (GUIDs), also known as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) can be used as practically unique identifiers in systems.</p><p>GUIDs have many advantages. You can safely generate identifiers in a distributed setting, compared to a central identifier registrar. Many systems are vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">Insecure Direct Object Reference</a> attacks, and even though permissions should always be checked for any access, it’s much easier to exploit these with sequential IDs compared to GUIDs (<a href="http://debarghyadas.com/writes/hacking-into-the-indian-education-system/">a high profile example</a>). Sequential IDs can leak <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14524061">important information</a>. Modern databases have custom <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html">in-built</a> UUID types which have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29882952/3399432">less storage overhead</a> and perform better than using a text type. There’s tons of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">blogs</a> extolling the benefits of GUIDs.</p><p>But anecdotally, there’s too many cases where raw GUIDs are used as identifiers, even though they might not be the appropriate choice.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>By their nature, GUIDs are opaque values that don’t lend too much information about what they’re identifying. They’re also generally unergonomic due to their length and structure. It’s almost trivially obvious that GUIDs shouldn't be in URLs due to their <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls">poor aesthetics</a>. To steal an example from <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/">Coding Horror</a>, database queries at the REPL can become frustrating.</p><pre><code>$ select * where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}'</code></pre><p>Poorly formatted log statements/errors can become harder to debug, since the identifiers don’t tell us what they’re identifying: </p><pre><code><code>error processing BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10: nil</code></code></pre><p>This can be mitigated by having libraries that report stack traces/line numbers and help identify the exact line of code with the error, so in general, UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of type safety of using raw integers and raw UUIDs can cause <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/27/uid/">horrifying problems</a> and is emblematic of lack of type safety with identifiers. With poor naming in code, it’s very easy to cause problems. Consider a variation of the example from the linked blog:</p><pre><code>def get_team_and_user_ids() -&gt; List[Tuple[UUID, UUID]]:
  """Returns a tuple of (team_id, user_id) tuples"""
  ...

def ban(user_id: UUID) -&gt; None: ...

for (user, team) in get_team_and_user_ids():
    ban(user)</code></pre><p>The script might just error out since UUIDs between users and teams aren’t shared, but the consequences might have been worse with integer IDs.</p><h2>Designing your Identifiers</h2><p>Identifiers should be designed for the properties of object they’re going to be identifying. We can mix and match components based on the importance of mutability, debuggability, performance and privacy for the object. For example, identifiers for permanent or external objects like customers should be treated differently to ephemeral or internal objects like tasks/jobs.</p><p><strong>Structure identifiers with prefixes and hierarchies</strong></p><p>Often for internal objects, debuggability is key, and prefixes can help with debugging. For example, all task identifiers could have the prefix “task-”. This automatically makes context free debugging easier, and makes it easy to grep for all messages that have IDs:</p><pre><code>error processing task-2: nil</code></pre><p>Hierarchies help even more with debuggability. Let’s say that every “Job” spawns N “Tasks”. Tasks IDs might want to contain their job IDs, so that it becomes trivially simple to grep for tasks of a particular job. For example, a task ID would look like: `job-123-task-1`. This also helps in ad-hoc database queries to find relevant rows without complex JOINs. We have examples of this in real life, like area codes in phone numbers.</p><p>We can add constant prefixes/hierarchies to any existing ID type. Critics might point out that storing a prefix with a UUID is wasteful since we’d lose the benefits of database optimized UUID types. This can easily be mitigated by storing un-prefixed UUID in the database, and application code automatically prepends a prefix for client code to use, but this might add some complexity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content Addressability</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, we want a zero inconsistency approach to storing objects, so it might make sense to make the identifier (or part of it) the checksum of the content that is to be stored. This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified. Git does this with SHA1 commit hashes (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/">even though this is being migrated to SHA256 as of December 2020</a>). <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (build system) uses a Content Addressable Store for <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Semi sortability</strong></p><p>If you need basic sortability and don’t mind the privacy concerns, consider using a scheme like Segment’s <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">KSUID</a>. This side-steps use of sequential IDs which will be painful to migrate away from. <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid#2-collision-free-coordination-free-dependency-free">UUID1 has some known issues</a>.</p><h2>Type Safety</h2><p>At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs. SQLAlchemy, a database manipulation library in Python, lets user implement a custom <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator">TypeDecorator</a> (and has native support for Postgres UUIDs). Let’s reproduce an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398042/3399432">example</a> with some tweaks:</p><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import uuid
from typing import NewType

db = SQLAlchemy()

FooId = NewType("FooId", bound=UUID)

class Foo(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(FooId(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, 
                   default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</code></pre><p>With a custom type “FooId” being marked as the column type, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">type checking</a> will prevent other ID types or raw UUID types there.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’ve seen that there’s a fair amount of complexity involved in id management and decision making. Some high scale applications end up deploying <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">custom ID generation</a> services. Identifiers are an early, hard to reverse decision that affect even schemaless datastores, so they’re worth thinking about in advance, and the right decision can compound developer productivity and prevent painful infrastructure migrations down the road.</p></div></div>]]>

        <section>
            <div><p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a solid remote access tool. IMO it's a key enabling technology for distributed systems. However it's effective security is not ideal. It's authentication scheme with RSA key pairs and wire-level encryption is great. But key management is tricky, and opening the firewall(s) for bidirectional SSH (port 22) increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>This article describes an AWS innovation introduced in 2019 called the session manager. Yes, you really can improve that mouse trap. The session manager adds to ssh a layer of authentication and authorization based on IAM and only requires HTTPS <em>outbound</em> on the server end. SSH rides on top of the Session Manager via SSH's proxy capability.</p>
<p>Now, remote host access might be on the wane. Cloud native is trending us towards managed platforms (cloud functions, serverless, container orchestrators), where it is discouraged, if not impossible, to start a shell. But for now, we still need it.</p>
<p>Let us level set first on SSH before we get into SSH proxied via the Session Manaager.</p>

<p>Straight, plain-vanilla SSH has a client and a server component, communicating over the SSH protocol. A shell session is initiated to a server-side user account, and authenticated either by a password or private key whose public key has been pre-authorized on the server:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh"></p>
<p>Note that ssh client is usually a bundle of tools: secure shell, file transfer and copy (ssh, sftp and scp). All three use the above architecture.</p>
<p>For reference, starting the session looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{public-ip-or-fqdn}
</code></pre>

<p>AWS offers session manager clients as part of the AWS CLI (with an add on) and the Console (Browser interface). The client and server communicate over HTTPS and secure web sockets, via the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) gateway:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct"></p>
<p>A few points to reemphasize here:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is effectively no risk of inbound attack. The firewall (security group and/or network acl) only needs an 443 outbound rule. The ssm agent on the EC2 Instances poll the gateway for session requests.</li>
<li>You can remove jumphosts altogether, or at least move them to private subnets. These instances need no public IP, and outbound access is enabled via a NAT gateway.</li>
<li>It's easier to harden authentication and manage credentials at scale. Console password rules (complexity, expiry), CLI access key rules (expiry) and use of MFA can be centralized. With AWS SSO or cross-account role assumption, each user has one set of credentials to use and rotate. Of course on and off-boarding is simplified as well.</li>
<li>You can more easily authorize access. SSH keys are often shared across hosts for convenience. IAM policies can be configured to limit access based on instance ids, tags, subnets, etc. on a per-user, per-role or per-group basis.</li>
<li>You can more easily audit access for forensics or integrate DevSecOps processes. Session lifecycle is logged in CloudTrail, and you can log to S3 the <em>full</em> shell history (both commands typed <em>and</em> responses displayed).</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="iamuser">IAM User</h2>
<ol>
<li>An IAM policy. I like using to use this set:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetConnectionStatus",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:DescribeSessions",
                "ssm:StartSession",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceProperties"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerStartDescribe"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:TerminateSession"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:session/${aws:username}-*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerTerminate"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above allows a user to list all current and historical sessions. Last I checked (Nov 2019), you cannot restrict DescribeInstances to those started by the user, but it does fortunately restrict entry termination to those the user has started.</p>
<p>You have to choose between users being able to view all current sessions (but not enter or terminate them) and viewing none at all. Same for historical sessions.</p>
<h2 id="ec2instance">EC2 Instance</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An SSM agent. It's pre-installed with the Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for Windows Server, Ubuntu Server 16 and 18, Amazon Linux 1 and 2, and all the AL variants for Batch, ECS, ElasticBeanstalk, etc. However, it has taken AWS many months to roll out the latest agent that supports SSH Proxying. Last I checked (Nov 2020), Ubuntu 16 supports direct but not proxied ssh. (Run <code>snap refresh amazon-ssm-agent</code> in your user data or other bootstrap mechanism to update it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM policy via an ec2 instance profile (role). The AWS doc on this is a little scattered. I like to use this set:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerCore"
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:ListInstanceAssociations",
                "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to log session data (shell history), you'll need another set of permissions, e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>Assign the profile (role) to the ec2 instance. If you assign the role after the instance started, bounce the ssm agent to get it connected to the backend.</p>

<p>Now let's bring in our trusty ssh, scp and sftp.</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh"></p>
<p>You can also use this approach for:</p>
<ol>
<li>custom users with non-default authorized ssh keys</li>
<li>custom users with password only authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>The proxy config for Linux (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
</code></pre>
<p>For Windows/OpenSSH (<code>C:\Users\{username}\.ssh\config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=%p"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple aws profiles configured, export (set in Windows Powershell) the AWS_PROFILE variable prior to starting the session.</p>
<p>So now we can use the instance id, instead of the public ip or fqdn:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{instance-id}
</code></pre>
<p>It will look and feel just like a straight ssh session. Occassionally starting the session takes a few seconds, but the performance from there on is just as good as ssh, in my experience.</p>
<p>All the other facilities, like scp and sftp, and remote execution of a command, are available as well. Also you can use the bundled ssh-add utility to store your keys in a cache and drop the -i option.</p>

<p>What about access to data stores, like private RDS or Elasticsearch/Kibana instance? You can use your client tools, like a MySQL Workbench in the case of RDS MySQL, or a browser in the case of Kibana. You connect them to a local port, e.g. 3306 or 8443, that is an open ssh tunnel riding on the session manager.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts access from the MySQL CLI client to a MySQL RDS:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1"></p>

<p>You can amend the user policy to restrict access. My two favorites follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whitelist specific people in a common policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerDenyRestricted",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-0cdbc0106ed03bba5",
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-07e8b9fc88ee02bf8"
            ]
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:username": "first.last1",
                    "aws:username": "first.last2"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use a group or role reference.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Whitelist categories of instances in a user- or group-specific policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "StartSessionResourceTag",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ssm:resourceTag/Purpose": "jumpbox"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Of course you then have to restrict ec2 instance tag updates to admins.</p>
<p>Refer to these <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-restrict-access-quickstart.html">quick start policies</a> for more.</p>

<p>By default, all session start and end is logged to CloudTrail, like all AWS service activity. You could enable some DevSecOps process on using CloudWatch event rules, like looking for .</p>
<p>You can enable session data logging to an S3 bucket, but take care! The content is highly sensitive. For example, users may type passwords in shell command arguments and cat files with PHI data. Therefore the logs must be sent to a well guarded bucket, e.g. in an audit account that is only allowed temporarily access by forensics investigators.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1"></p>
<p>AWS Session Manager enables us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>harden our systems (reduce the attack surface, use multi-factor authentication and fine-grained authorization)</li>
<li>centralize identity and access management</li>
<li>centralize audit</li>
</ol>
<p>And all this with no degredation in the user experience.</p>
<p>IMO, it's a win-win for dev, ops and security teams.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>To say I was a gamer in my teenage years is an understatement. However, the gaming scene today is vastly different, and it's clear from Twitch and YouTube gaming that people really enjoy watching others play. For me, gaming has always been about the stories and the worlds that provides an escape from the present world. Second to that, I enjoy conversing with friends about all things gaming.</p><p>I am an adult now with responsibilities towards work and family. My passion for games got lost along the way. People say, if you really are passionate, you will make time. This is true to a certain extent. Life isn't always that simple.</p><p>Anyway, earlier this year, I was searching for a place where the topic of conversation is gaming without the negativity of the real world. Three of us (similar age and jobs) found comfort in <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>. I take full credit for this idea and execution because when I initially suggested Basecamp; I was told, the last thing we need in our life is another corporate app. The idea is to escape work. It's all a matter of perspective, one needs to look at a software objectively and use it for your use case.</p><h2 id="what-is-basecamp">What is Basecamp?</h2><p>Well, in this case, it's a one-stop shop for all things gaming between close friends. <em>In the real world, Basecamp is a premier project management + internal communication tool for remote WFH teams worldwide.</em> With over 3.3 million Basecamp accounts created, it seems well regarded in the project management world etc. I am no expert, but I am responsible for 10 of the 3.3 million Basecamp accounts, and we do not use these for work or any revenue generating activities.</p><h2 id="why-basecamp-personal">Why Basecamp Personal?</h2><ul><li>Multi Platform — Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and any modern browser</li><li>Privacy focused</li><li>Free</li><li>Flexible and modular</li></ul><p>We all work in big corporations, and you wouldn't believe that most apps/services are blocked by our IT department. On the other hand, Basecamp works perfectly.</p><p>At first, we were cautious of using Basecamp for free because, as you know, nothing in life is free. If you do not pay financially, you will pay through sacrificing your privacy and/or data (🤔 Gmail, Facebook etc). Fortunately, <strong>some things in life are still free with no other costs, and Basecamp Personal is a delightful example of this.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-we-use-basecamp">How we use Basecamp?</h2><p><em>Note: My friends were not keen on making our Basecamp setup public, so I attempted to recreate it and basing the characters in this story on David and Jason (<strong>for light-hearted fun only</strong>) to give you an example of how we use Basecamp Personal.</em></p><p><em>The ease of account creation is the single most reason I attempted to recreate our Basecamp setup. In addition, Basecamp only asked for my name and email address. Nothing else! No credit cards, no secret questions, no personally identifiable information. <strong>It's actually nice to have your privacy respected.

Replaying this together again in our adulthood, resurfaced memories of the time when all we did was enjoy and have fun in each other’s company through our passion for gaming.</p><p>Using Basecamp, we organised when we will play online, our respective characters and argued over who will pick which character. We also discussed our childhood memories. It’s fascinating because each of us vividly remembered stories that the others had forgotten. We shared Easter eggs we found. The music and the overall feel of the game is an enormous walk down nostalgia street.</p><h2 id="basecamp-for-task-management">Basecamp for Task Management</h2><p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things by Culture Code</a> is my task management app of choice and has been for over 2 years now. As much as I enjoy using Things, it bugs me that I cannot use it at work (Windows) and cannot attach files to my tasks. I actually tried to move to Basecamp for all things task management but the limitation of 3 projects (5 would be ideal) and lack of repeating tasks was a dealbreaker and the paid up version is $99 a month which is out of the question for me.</p><p>I will say this, if it suits your workflow, Basecamp Personal is excellent for personal task management. It's extremely flexible, intuitive, collaborative (up to 20 users), well designed and a very reliable service.</p><p>Considering how unreliable our current corporate solution is, I pitched Basecamp to my organisation’s IT head. It’s likely this will gain any traction as changing software for an organisation of 30,000 people is no easy task.</p><p>My intention behind this post is to demonstrate the importance of having an open mind and think outside the box, thus allowing you to objectively evaluative the best use of tools in your arsenal. Basecamp is viewed as a business software solution. However, it's clear from my use case, that one shouldn't pigeonhole software into categories.</p><h5 id="my-heartfelt-thanks-to-the-entire-team-of-basecamp-and-the-founders-for-providing-basecamp-personal-free-of-charge">My heartfelt thanks to the entire team of Basecamp and the founders for providing Basecamp Personal free of charge</h5>

December 30, 2020 | https://questinglog.com/2020-year-in-review/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://questinglog.com/2020-year-in-review/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>2020 was my second full year running <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a> as a screencasting business, and it enjoyed some growth. Looking at my dashboards, it's fallen short of the <a href="https://questinglog.com/2019-year-in-review">goals I set last year</a>, but it's still considerable progress given all that's happened.
<small>(Disclaimer: These numbers haven't been audited and are simply what I've pulled from various accounts and spreadsheets. The year isn't quite over, either)</small></p> <p>Alchemist Camp is a site with many screencasts for programmers learning Elixir. Most of them are free and on <a href="https://youtube.com/alchemistcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, but many are restricted to paying subscribers. I've also launched a couple of adjacent products.</p> <h2 id="_2020-goals-recap"><a href="#_2020-goals-recap">#</a> 2020 goals recap</h2> <p>I had set four goals for 2020:</p> <ol><li>Double gross subscription sales to $28k</li> <li>Keep lifetime retention above 60%</li> <li>Launch the second product I've been working on before the first of March</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference</li></ol> <p><strong>#1 (miss)</strong>: Growth has been very slow since March.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/growth-chart-2020.d126cd0d.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p><strong>#2 (barely)</strong>: Retention of existing subscribers was decent, and barely cleared goal #2 as long as people who subscribed and churned multiple times only count as a single churn.</p> <p><strong>#3 (hit)</strong>: I got a 2nd product launched by March! It was the <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit</a> I'd already announced would be a freebie for my existing Alchemist Camp subscribers last Black Friday.</p> <p><strong>#4 (miss)</strong>: I've been in Taiwan all year since arriving from Japan at the end of February and wasn't able to make it to an Elixir conference in the US. I won't count this one due to the pandemic.</p> <h2 id="new-products"><a href="#new-products">#</a> New products</h2> <p>I released two new products this year, both for Elixir devs.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter"><a href="#phoenix-igniter">#</a> Phoenix Igniter</h3> <p>Phoenix Igniter is a <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit for building Phoenix apps</a> that includes various boilerplate code I've found myself writing repeatedly across projects. It's in beta, and is useful for me but I'm having a hard time getting any user feedback.</p> <p>Thus far, it's been entirely driven by what I want on my own projects. It's a one-time purchase product, so sales are very spikey. I gave it away to every Alchemist Camp subscriber during Black Friday of 2019, so there are considerably more users than paying customers.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/igniter-chart-2020.21f716f4.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>I have high hopes for Igniter. Ultimately, I can see it appealing to a much broader group of devs than my screencast subscriptions on Alchemist Camp can.</p> <h3 id="_5-little-potions"><a href="#_5-little-potions">#</a> 5 Little Potions</h3> <p>5 Little Potions is an <a href="https://alchemist.camp/little-potions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebook for beginner Elixir learners</a> and I'm currently about 45% of the way writing it. I had a few goals in starting this book. First of all, I wanted to have something substantial for beginners. About the first 15 screencasts or so I did for Alchemist Camp are aimed at beginners, but the last 150+ have been aimed more at peers and people digging into specific topics.</p> <p>I also felt like coding some games instead of just business-focused web apps!</p> <p>It hasn't brought in a lot of revenue, due to the low price, but I think it's a great way to reach more learners. As I finish the 3rd, 4th and 5th games in the book and get ready for its launch, I expect to see quite a few more people buy.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/potions-chart-2020.fe47bae1.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>Okay! Let's have a look at the stats...</p> <h2 id="financial-stats"><a href="#financial-stats">#</a> Financial stats</h2> <h3 id="alchemist-camp"><a href="#alchemist-camp">#</a> Alchemist Camp</h3> <ul><li>Alchemist Camp revenue: $18,846.63 (+35%)</li> <li>Wage per hour: ~$38 (+52%)</li> <li>Paying subscribers: 96 current</li> <li>Lifetime retention: 60%</li> <li>Expenses: $4901.56 (-1%)</li> <li><strong>Profits: $13,945.07 (+55%)</strong></li></ul> <h3 id="expenses-breakdown"><a href="#expenses-breakdown">#</a> Expenses Breakdown</h3> <ul><li>Stripe: $2,295.98</li> <li>ConvertKit: $441</li> <li>Digital Ocean: $316.86</li> <li>Domain names: $120</li> <li><strong>Services Total: $3,222.84</strong></li> <li>Technical books: $724.15 (Mostly Manning, Pragprog and No Starch Press)</li> <li>Screencasts and courses: $954.57 (about 50/50 business and technical)</li> <li><strong>Educational Total: $1,678.72</strong></li></ul> <p>This year's expenses ended up almost identical to last year. However the breakdown is very different. Stripe cost considerably more, due to a combination of higher volume, increased fees and using more services. In particular, Stripe moved its customers from Subscriptions (for which I was a free forever plan) to Billing, which has a percentage fee on every transaction.</p> <p>Another major cost increase was due to my moving from Mail Chimp to ConvertKit. I was spending $49/month for marketing email services for most of the year. It wasn't worth it for me in the end, so I migrated to SendFox.</p> <p>My educational spending was less than half what it was last year. That's not because I'm any less of a believer in investing in it, but mostly due to being behind my revenue goals and finding better bargains.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter-starter-kit"><a href="#phoenix-igniter-starter-kit">#</a> Phoenix Igniter (starter kit)</h3> <ul><li>Phoenix Igniter revenue: $1,140</li> <li>Stripe fees: $44.16</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,095.84</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-little-potions-ebook"><a href="#_5-little-potions-ebook">#</a> 5 Little Potions (ebook)</h3> <ul><li>5 Little Potions revenue: $1,575</li> <li>Gumroad fees: $129</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,446</li></ul>  <ul><li>YouTube Views: 77.7k (+26%)</li> <li>Monthly Unique Visitors: ~12k (excluding bots)</li> <li>Accounts created (all time): 4705</li></ul> <h2 id="big-wins"><a href="#big-wins">#</a> Big wins</h2> <ol><li>My RSI is nearly healed!</li> <li>Podcasting with Justin Vincent</li> <li>Overcoming crazy obstacles</li> <li>The idea muscle</li> <li>Doubling down on learning</li></ol> <h3 id="healing-wrists"><a href="#healing-wrists">#</a> Healing wrists</h3> <p>Three years and a month ago, I could barely use a phone or mouse at all. It hurt just to brush my teeth. I had <em>severe</em> repetitive stress injuries and was in a pretty bad bind.</p> <p>Even <a href="http://localhost:8080/2020-year-in-review/#wrists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, I was still far from better. It's a big part of why I've put so much time into reading, podcasting and other hands-free activities the past couple of years.</p> <p>But now, I'm finally feeling about 90%. I still do stretches and still do 100% of my computing from an ergonomic keyboard (or iPad + pencil), but I can actually bang out an 8-hour day of coding and typical computer use and feel okay the next day. I'm not pushing it, but I'm <em>thrilled</em> about the improvement!</p> <h3 id="the-reactor-am-podcast"><a href="#the-reactor-am-podcast">#</a> The Reactor.am podcast</h3> <p>The level of serendipity I experience in my life sometimes astounds me and this is one of those cases. In my yearly review last year, I wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>But then this spring, a funny thing happened. I got sucked into this long-running podcast called <a href="http://techzinglive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techzing</a> and started listening to the archives (which go back ten years) and I heard some interviews they did with Amy Hoy.</p></blockquote> <p>Well, things have progressed. I just finished recording the 44th episode of <a href="https://reactor.am/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactor.am</a>, a mastermind-based podcast a few hours ago. My co-host is Justin Vincent—one of the two co-hosts of Techzing. He's got far, far more entrepreneurial experience than I do and it's been a good learning experience.</p> <p>This certainly wasn't remotely a goal or something that even seemed within the realm of possibility a year ago, but it's been great! If we're living in a simulation, I'm pretty sure I'm a player character 😎</p> <h3 id="overcoming-crazy-obstacles"><a href="#overcoming-crazy-obstacles">#</a> Overcoming crazy obstacles</h3> <p>I was in Taiwan on a 90 day visa-free entry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PPfl4XRxh4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when borders started closing</a> due to the pandemic and managed to get an entrepreneur visa good for a year.</p> <p>Then later in the spring, my bank closed my account and disabled my debit card due to an error, while I was abroad... in the middle of the pandemic. That was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCra7EaPQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly a crisis</a> since 100% of my income flows through the account and I needed things like food, housing and water.</p> <p>But, I managed to hustle and overcome both obstacles mostly intact. All I lost was some sleep and some time. All-in-all, that's not bad for 2020.</p> <h3 id="the-idea-muscle"><a href="#the-idea-muscle">#</a> The idea muscle</h3> <p>I've been religiously sticking to James Altucher's <em>Idea Muscle</em> practice, picking a topic and generating at least 10 ideas every day. It seems like a small thing, but after a month or two, I really started feeling a difference. I attribute both the book I'm currently writing and my increased screencasting productivity to it.</p> <p>I've been doing all of it on an iPad and just using Apple notes with the pencil and it's been just as good in terms of writing, thinking and processing as a paper and pencil were last time I tried this but it's easier to save and review them.</p> <h3 id="doubling-down-on-learning"><a href="#doubling-down-on-learning">#</a> Doubling down on learning</h3> <p>I've continued aggressively trying to deepen my technical skills while picking up some new ones that will help me make progress as a founder. Humble Bundles and ebook purchases in general have been paying off the most.</p> <p>One great thing I've realized is that an iPad + pen is a near ideal tool for active reading. I can fearlessly highlight the heck out of any book I read and later erase any highlights I don't want to keep.</p> <h2 id="what-didn-t-go-so-well"><a href="#what-didn-t-go-so-well">#</a> What didn't go so well</h2> <ol><li>Growth</li> <li>Decision paralysis</li></ol> <h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth">#</a> Growth</h3> <p>My audience is growing just as slow as it was a year ago. I noted an increase in competition in the market then and it seems to have continued, likely in part due to the pandemic.</p> <p>At that time, I wasn't too concerned and saw such competition as likely to grow the market overall and mostly have little effect on me. Now I'm not so sure.</p> <p>Elixir is a <em>tiny</em> market, and I'm seeing the low-end of it getting flooded with new courses while the total number of people learning it or using at work is fairly flat.</p> <p>This is part of why I've broadened my business into adjacent territory with the book and the starter kit and why I'm looking at still other opportunities involving software as opposed to educational products.</p> <h3 id="decision-paralysis"><a href="#decision-paralysis">#</a> Decision paralysis</h3> <p>I know I can make faster progress than I have so far, but it's <em>very</em> difficult to evaluate what business efforts are worth investing time into.</p> <p>I'm currently evaluating a <em>lot</em> of options, including finding contract work and investing money as well as time into a project.</p> <br>   <br> <h2 id="goals-for-2021"><a href="#goals-for-2021">#</a> Goals for 2021</h2> <ol><li>Break $75k total revenue</li> <li>Launch a SaaS product, likely a micro-SaaS</li> <li>Find a banking setup I can rely on while living outside the US</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference???</li> <li>Grow sales in all three existing products</li></ol> <p>Despite everything, I'm feeling even more confident this year than I did last year. I may experience some pain revolving around banking and residency status again, but I'll find my way through it and keep investing in the long-term.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25587873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

December 30, 2020 | https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/stories/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/stories/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><p>When Snapchat launched Stories in October 2013, no one could have anticipated the ripple effect this would have across the software ecosystem. In the 7-years since its launch, every major consumer internet company has adopted its own flavor of Stories to give its users that familiar, lean back content consumption experience that they’ve grown accustomed to. Even though there’s no singular app that has monopolized consumer attention, it’s clear that the Story content format is the real winner of the mobile-first world. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6429b1d18aec12ac96faf585a80c0ac5d02672fc/20951/img/posts/stories/stories.png" alt="Examples of mobile stories formats"></p><p>The way companies with an ads-based business model make more money is relatively straightforward: get users to spend more time consuming relevant content and seeing more ads. For over a decade, consumer internet companies have been tweaking and improving upon the traditional feed-based content consumption model. First there was Google’s paginated results, followed by Facebook’s infinite scroll and Pinterest’s masonry grid. Each is designed to balance exploiting what the app already knows about its users with exploration of new topics adjacent to the user’s current preferences.</p><p>Stories were the first new discovery paradigm that completely changed the way social apps began to think about engaging with their users. Beyond just how users consume content, Stories also changed the way people thought about creating content. By making Stories temporal, the quality bar was lowered so users don’t have to overthink whether something they share should be a part of their permanent record on the internet. Suddenly, users weren’t worried about polluting their own self image (or their friends’ feeds) which made it a lot easier to create content at a much higher volume than they did with feed posts. </p><p>From a metrics perspective, it makes sense why this new paradigm is so attractive: Stories users end up spending more time in-app across more frequent sessions and end up direct messaging each other more, creating a virtuous feedback loop of engagement. In early 2019 Instagram reported that they had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/instagram-stories-500-million/">500 Million daily active users of Stories</a>, with 1 Billion monthly active users of the app overall! That DAU-to-MAU ratio is astounding, and something that’s understandably envious to the rest of the consumer app ecosystem.</p><p>While the cat’s out of the bag that Stories are the winning format for mobile, marketers are left scratching their heads about how to handle supporting all of these new native formats. Depending on a marketer’s type of business and target audience, they now has to deal with Instagram (Grid, Stories, Reels, IGTV), Snapchat, TikTok, Google (SEO, AMP Stories), Pinterest (Pins, Stories), Facebook (Posts, Stories), Twitter (Tweets, Fleets) and LinkedIn (Posts, Stories). </p><p>The proliferation of at-scale social networks presents a massive opportunity for marketers to reach their audience unlike ever before, but it comes with a very real cost. Each channel has its own rules, best practices and creative sizes which means a “one size fits all” approach just simply doesn’t work. Practically speaking this means that if a marketer wants to cross-promote a blog post across social networks today, they have to produce 4+ creative formats and publish it to 5+ channels. This leads to a meaningful decrease in velocity and increase in the time between publishing a blog post and actually being able to promote it. When combined with the fact that all of this hard work goes away after 24 hours, it’s clear that this is a very real challenge today.</p><p>Almost overnight, the bottleneck for marketers has become creating all of the design assets they need to maximize their reach and maintain their quality bar. Companies like the New York Times have dedicated 20+ person design teams just focused on solving this problem, but for the average company this isn’t even a distant possibility. More likely, the marketer has a shared design resource with other parts of the company, and is relegated to jump into design tools themselves to try and make ends meet. </p><p>Stories are the straw that broke the marketer’s back, and with their recent widespread adoption will come a new wave of products that are meant to make the process of generating stories and other social content dramatically easier. Today marketers have 3 choices for producing stories: native creation tools, templated design tools, or pro design tools. </p><p>We’re at the beginning of a new era of design tooling that generates beautiful, on-brand social content automatically. This fourth type of tool will let marketers remix their existing content into all of the relevant formats to power their social strategies. These tools won’t automate the role of the designer or marketer, but instead elevate their position from being the executor to the strategist. </p><p>Aesthetic’s generator tool is the first of its kind to do exactly this, and is able to auto-generate images and videos for use across all major formats today. We’re actively working with thought-leading marketers across a wide range of industries and are onboarding new users every week.

<p>Traditionally at the year end I like to note most significant trends that I see unfolding in the DevOps world. I did not know about the level of disruption that Covid would cause when I put “Remote Asynchronous Workforce” on the <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/01/04/devops-2020-tectonic-shift/">last year’s list</a>. As we now know this actually turned out to be the #1 trend of 2020, which to me actually was the brightest spot of the otherwise grim year.</p>



<p>Now, going to 2021 here are the trends that I would like to highlight:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Bundles and Software Bills of Materials.</strong> The industry is actively looking to automate push-button deployments but at the same time preserving transparency and traceability of software components. From the one side we want a black box with the whole suite of what we are deploying. From the other side we want to be able to quickly replace a component which security or stability was compromised. That’s why bundles are so important. Read more about bundles in my recent post <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/11/15/devops-bundles-new-name-of-the-game/">here</a>.<br></li><li><strong>Complexity vs Simplicity paradox.</strong> Business wants simplicity and quick roll-outs of ad-hoc software components. To achieve that they are actively looking at so-called “no-code” or “low-code” tools. Similarly, in DevOps world “Serverless” or “No-Ops” tools become increasingly popular. At the same time, this approach creates a huge scalability gap between initial prototyping and production deployments. This problem is only starting to unfold and I expect we would be hearing more about it in 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Vertical integration in DevOps vs “Best Tool for the Job”.</strong> Philosophy of DevOps tooling is currently split between companies like GitLab who are pushing for single suite of tools to handle all your DevOps needs and many others who build specialized tools which do better job in their niches. I wrote a post about this some time ago <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/03/20/lego-world-no-1-devops-solution-fits-all/">here</a>. What I currently observe is increased marketing effort from companies advocating vertical integration to gain market share. I believe in the end of a day this is harmful to the overall software quality and that the “Best Tool for the Job” approach would be the preferred one. But in any case it would be interesting to observe the community reaction to this marketing push.<br></li><li><strong>Widening gap between high performers and low performers.</strong> Not sure if this will happen in 2021 or a little later, but there is a growing sense of urgency for low performers to do better or be wiped out by competition. Essentially, the trend we are waiting for is mass migration of low performers (in DevOps terms) to modern tooling and modern philosophies. This creates massive challenge and massive opportunity at the same time for DevOps practitioners.<br></li><li><strong>Kanban.</strong> Kanban is often more appropriate than Scrum for DevOps-oriented organizations. Still, the adoption level of Kanban remains sub-par to that of Scrum. However, I see the trend that this is changing. People enjoy Kanban boards and gradually move to adopt wider Kanban principles (starting with things like WIP-limits).<br></li><li><strong>CI is the new Version Control – CD will come next. </strong>These days it is hard to imagine a software project without version control. And starting one is as simple as typing “git init”. Now with Dockerfile, Continuous Integration piece is not much harder. So essentially, every piece of software now relies on working Version Control <strong>and </strong>its Continuous Integration pipeline. These are pretty much 2 things you do right away when you start a software project. And I believe this trend will be solidified in 2021. Continuous Delivery would come later, but it will come inevitably. See my post on <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/06/04/7-best-practices-modern-cicd/">best CI/CD practices</a> for more details on the current state of things.</li></ol>



<p>I believe these are the most important trends that are happening right now in the DevOps world. Happy 2021, I truly hope it would be much happier than 2020!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>It all started at my first job. I’ve been around 6 months in the company and was happy getting used to the ropes of my current job. In those 6 months, I quickly pushed to prod (without even knowing it) and was learning very fast. I still remember when my boss called me to his office: We are going to do some changes and you’ll lead this new 3 person team. I thought to myself: Cool, I’ve learned some books about leadership, this could be fun.</p>



<p>The tricky part was the members of the team. They were a couple of technicians who had more than ten years on the job and more than twenty years in the company ( I was twenty years old). One of them was even a team lead recently. I did not understand the mechanics of that re-org at the time and still don’t have all the information about what was happening. I wish I had some cool story about why I was chosen to lead the team, really don’t know.</p>



<p>It was not a walk in the park, things started to get ugly before they could get better. As expected they pushed back a lot, they did not like the change, me, or anything that was happening. It’s funny, looking back I think my ego should have been hurt based on all the times they tried to avoid working with me and change things. I guess I was so confused with everything that I had no time for that.</p>



<p>When we started to work together, one thing was clear: they were not in the mood to take orders from a kid. I was not in the mood to give orders to them. This particular situation helped me a lot and shaped the way I work ten years later.</p>



<p>Given that it was almost impossible to give orders and avoid starting a world war. I started listening, that’s what I did the most in the first weeks. I listened and asked questions. Not like interrogations, more like curious questions. I think the key to the questions what that I wanted to learn from them. I was not a trick, I was very interested in what they were doing.</p>



<p>I still remember some kind of pranks they pulled on me. They would tell me they had run out of a particular material they needed. I had made a lot of calls and research to try to find it for them, then they magically found some in the warehouse or the car they used. I did not know these were pranks, I learned later when they had another team lead (I laughed that time).</p>



<p>With some retrospective, I think these pranks were not just to pick on the new guy. I think they were testing me. They wanted to see what I did, would I forget about the problem, slack off, blame it on them, or take ownership and be part of the team. Most of the time I came with solutions and discussed alternatives with the team. Some weeks later I think they started to trust me.</p>



<p>There was a point where I started to notice that I could help with some things. Not so much in executing, but there were some things they needed help with. Mostly operational excellence. They were relieved to have someone handle that. Every week we were becoming a better team.</p>



<p>Patience was a foundation for this team. At least from my side. I did not rush things out (I was not even sure how to do that) and never try to impose my ideas or way of working. I trusted a lot the team and things started to look better.</p>



<p>Not everything was perfect. We had disagreements and sometimes we preferred different approaches. This is normal in all teams, the good part is that we started to have a process. We had a daily meeting, talked about what we needed to do that day and we talked briefly at the end of the day. Every side learned to cede sometimes and when months have passed we were playing by ear.</p>



<p>Even though we were a productive team and technically very respected, what I always treasure from these experiences is human relationships. I still have a great time whenever I talk to these two people and we have a blast remembering the good old days. Based on what they say, they learn a thing or two from me, but I learned a ton from them and that experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I came across this <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1204031.pdf">paper</a> which looks at ways to teach students complex systems courtesy of Jessica Kerr’s <a href="https://jessitron.com/2020/10/11/clockwork-to-complexity-scale-in-time-and-software/">blog</a>.</p><p>Based on how students reason about complex systems, they were placed in 4 categories in order of increasing sophistication: <strong>Completely Clockwork</strong><em>, </em><strong>Somewhat Clockwork, Somewhat Complex and Completely Complex.</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>“Clockwork responses are those that show deterministic, linear, single-cause, non-networked, centralized, or static system interactions or states, whereas complex responses are those that demonstrate nondeterministic, nonlinear, multiple causes, networked, decentralized, or dynamic system interactions or states”.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In my experience this translates extremely well to the progression of a developer and their understanding of the complexity of the ecosystem they operate in. So, I wanted to attempt to derive a learning progression for developers.</p><p>At each level of development, I recommend a few books. Each book hopefully is a thread you can pull on, if you want to go deeper into a particular topic.The book recommendations are subjective, but I believe that one can chart their own curriculum following the basic model. The recommendations that I make are just based on my own experience and aim to serve merely as guidance.</p><p>When it comes to progression to the next level, my general advice would be to master the level you are operating on and then aim to understand whats needed to operate at the next level.</p><p><strong>Completely Clockwork</strong></p><p>At this level most of the work is involved in making changes in a single service or component. This is where most of the <em>‘coding’</em> happens. The amount of time that will be spent reading your code will be multiples of the amount you would take to write it. You will work more with existing code rather than writing new code. A corollary of this fact is that you need to know how to make your code easy to change.So your focus should be on writing readable code and making it easy to change. </p><p>Your scope of work will probably within your team and its very likely that your circle of influence, impact and visibility would mostly be your team as well. The abstraction at which you operate in is your team. </p><p>The advice I would give at this level is to optimise for seeing problems solved through different <a href="https://charity.wtf/2020/11/01/questionable-advice-the-trap-of-the-premature-senior/">reference points</a>. </p><p>My recommendations for this level would be:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rDymed">Refactoring</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2L4q3HJ">Clean Architecture</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Somewhat Clockwork</strong></p><p>As you begin to build familiarity and also gain experience, you might see that increasingly you begin to look outward from the immediate scope of your team. You begin to try to understand how the surroundings affect the goals of your teams.  You start going on <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/surviving-the-organisational-side-quest">organisational side quests</a> to achieve your team’s goals. The abstraction at which you operate is still typically your team but the way you look at things becomes more outward looking.</p><p>In modern software development, distributed systems are ubiquitous. Even when you are making a change to a single service, that service most likely lives in an ecosystem of other services and a plethora of other distributed tools. As you grow in seniority you need to understand how best to interact with other services  and also the tradeoffs involved with each tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rFMkfH">Designing Data Intensive Applications&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o1QDjf">Building Microservices</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Somewhat Complex</strong></p><p>As you gain more experience, you would have ideally developed some <a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/31/on-touching-candles.html">calluses</a>, had a ring side view of  some <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">heart stopping close shaves</a>. This will prepare you to operate at next abstraction: teams of teams.  You would be advising on how to organise software and teams best to make teams successful in aggregate. You could be either leading <a href="https://lethain.com/migrations/">migrations to address technical debt</a> or <a href="https://lethain.com/reclaim-unreasonable-software/">reclaiming unreasonable software</a>. It will also probably be your call as to when to do what.</p><p>A practitioner operating mostly at this level needs to be able to use models to explain the  overall system or domain they are operating in and its interactions with its neighbouring domains. These models are not just to explain the software system but also the teams that surround that software. You need to understand the best models for organising teams to drive maximum impact. Additionally, as the operator of <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">complex systems</a> they wear two hats : that of the producer and that of the protector against failure. The practitioner needs to be able to handle this duality well.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eAl7">Domain Driven Design</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o2KenM">Team Topologies</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3mYTWpZ">SRE Book&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eWrX">Accelerate&nbsp;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Completely Complex</strong></p><p>The abstraction that you operate in now is the entire organisation or in bigger companies, an entire division or department. Your focus is primarily on what to build rather than the how.  You will be doing a lot of writing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6530173230102122496/">since you need to communicate at scale</a>.</p><p>According to the paper, a completely complex system is a dynamic process, which is constantly in a state of flux. Any patterns here are emergent. Changes have both short term and long term repercussions. You also realise that the system is self organised for the most part. This sounds a lot like the modern organisation. At this scope you are typically operating as the technical leadership. You need to be able to form technical strategies grounded in the needs of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">Wardley Maps</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/38Msirg">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></p></li></ul><p>So to summarise, this is what we end up with as a progression plan for developers over varying degrees of complexity.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:172810,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>There is a pithy saying - “<em><strong>All models are wrong, some are useful</strong></em>.” The model I have described here is not perfect. The skills and responsibilities needed at different levels are at a continuum, not discrete. I merely aim to expose you to the different abstractions that engineers operate in based on where they are in their career. I hope you found this useful.</p><p>If you are here, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sidsarda">twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>
Well, I'm finally bringing this series back from a months-long hiatus! In the
<a href="https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-2.txt.html">last post</a>, we started implementing an
emulator for a simple instruction set of our own. We sketched out the overall
architecture, and implemented a few instructions for moving data between virtual
registers and memory, learning about the corresponding x86-64 instructions
along the way. In this one, I want to focus on arithmetic and logic operations,
which will allow our emulator to do stuff that is a bit more interesting than
just moving bytes around. But before we jump into that, I want to briefly talk 
about how numbers are represented in a computer.
</p>

<h2>Number Representation</h2>

<p>
If you've made it this far in the tutorial, chances are that you understand the
basics of how the binary notation for numbers works, and don't need an
explanation of what bits and bytes are. So I'm not going to spend time on that.
</p>

<p>
However, there are some particular details related to representing signed
integers. Theoretically, this topic should be a part of any computer
science curriculum. But not every coder has a formal CS background, and even
among those that do, most either don't remember or have never encountered
these things in practice - because one simply doesn't have to think about them
for the vast majority of time when programming computers.
</p>

<p>
But number representation <i>is</i> important for understanding the arithmetic
instructions that we're going to be looking at; therefore, I feel like I can't
simply gloss over the topic.
</p>

<p>
If you already know how signed integers work in most computers, this might be a
good refresher, otherwise you might learn something new!
</p>

<h2>Representing Integers</h2>

<p>
Computers can't represent "numbers" in the abstract, mathematical sense.
They're finite, discrete machines and there's not enough memory in the world to
store a representation of an arbitrarily large quanitity, or even the
representation of a rather small, but "weird" quantity like
<a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">tau</a>.
</p>

<p>
We cope with that limitation by conceding that we'll never be able to represent
an arbitrary number. Instead, we use the resources at our disposal to represent
a subset of all numbers. We look at all the bit strings of a fixed
length, and agree that each of them represents a particular number.
However many different bit strings we can deal with, that's how many different
numbers we can represent.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can represent 256 distinct numbers using 8 bits, because there
are 256 different bit strings of length 8. Generally speaking, it is entirely up
to our interpretation <i>which</i> 256 numbers these strings represent.
For example, you could decide to interpret each of the 8 bits as a binary digit,
so that the entire 8-bit bitstring is nothing more than its corresponding
number, written out using the binary numeral system. On the other hand, you
might decide that the first 6 bits specify the "whole" part of the number, and
the remaining 2 bits specify the "fractional" part (this is called fixed-point
representation and used to be commonplace before the wide spread of
hardware-accelerated floating point arithmetic). It all depends on which subset
of numbers interests you at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
Certain instructions of a given processor have baked-in assumptions about the
representation used by their parameters, and behave accordingly. For example,
the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/addps">addps</a> SSE instruction
assumes that its parameters are floating point numbers adhering to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard. We're
more interested in instructions doing simple integer arithmetic, but those also
assume a certain representation, as we're about to see.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at some of the possible ways to represent integers in a
computer. For the sake of simplicity and readability, I am going to use eight
bits for everything, but all of this extends to a larger number of bits in a
straightforward manner.
</p>

<p>
In case of positive integers, the simple and straightforward mapping is to
just use a given integer's binary representation, as we've mentioned before.
If the representation doesn't take all of the available eight bits, we'll pad
out the number with zeroes from the left (the additional whitespace in the
middle of the bit string is added just for readability):
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2</td><td>10</td><td>0000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>3</td><td>11</td><td>0000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>4</td><td>100</td><td>0000 0100</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
So far, so good. But things start to get sticky when we introduce negative
numbers into the mix. How would you represent a number like -5? Sure, if you
were doing math with a pencil and a piece of paper, you could just write "-101"
instead of "-5" and be done with it, but you can't exactly do that with a
computer.
</p>

<p>
The initial instinct might be to use the leftmost (most significant) bit to
indicate the sign. If the very first bit of a bit string is 0, then we assume the number to be
positive. If it is 1, we assume the number to be negative.
This way of coding signed numbers is called "sign-and-magnitude representation"
and it was used in some very old machines.
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-3</td><td>-11</td><td>1000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-2</td><td>-10</td><td>1000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>1000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Astute readers might have noticed an interesting problem here.
We've assigned the string "0000 0000" to 0, but how are we to interpret the
string 1000&nbsp;0000? It's -0, so the effective value it represents is just 0.
It looks like we ended up with two representations for a zero - one "positive"
and one "negative".
</p>

<p>
While having two representations for the same number is kind of ugly, it's
actually the least of our worries. In fact, the standard for floating point,
IEEE 754, mentioned earlier, does have the notion of "negative zero", and it's
no big deal. But nevertheless, the sign-and-magnitude representation is not used
on any modern machine that I am aware of. That is because there is a <i>much</i>
better way of representing signed integers, that not only avoids having two
representations for 0, but actually ends up being much easier to deal with in
hardware. However, in order to really understand why this alternative
representation we're about to propose is better, we need to take a little
detour.
</p>

<h3>Learning to Add</h3>

<p>
Let's mentally put integer representation on the backburner for a minute.
Let's think about how CPUs work on the lowest possible level (the lowest that I
can grasp myself anyway).
</p>

<p>
The most basic component of a CPU is a switch that can be controlled by an
electrical current: when a current is present, the switch is ON, and when there
is no current present, the switch is OFF. You could build a crude switch like
that yourself using a few pieces of metal, insulation and some wire - it's
called a relay.
</p>

<p>
Some early machines might have used relays (which were huge and unreliable), but
modern machines use a different kind of switch - the transistor, which is 
semiconductor-based. It's extremely reliable, and can be made so tiny that 
it's possible to cram billions of these things into a small space. Still, the
principle is the same - a transistor is a simple switch, controlled by
electrical current, it's just miniscule in size.
</p>

<p>
By wiring switches together in a particular manner, one can build <i>logic
gates</i> - tangible hardware implementations of the AND/OR/NOT/XOR/etc.
functions that most programmers are familiar with. For example, here's a diagram
showing how you can build an OR logic gate from two switches:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/sw_OR_tmb.jpg">
<br>
<small><i>Image credit: simplecpudesign.com</i></small>
</p>

<p>
If any one of the switches (labelled A and B respectively) is turned on, the
output (labelled Z) will have current.
If both A and B are off, Z will have no current. Switches act as "operands" for
the logical OR operation, and the output Z represents the result.
</p>

<p>
Logic gates can be further wired together to make more complex circuits, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
So, fundamentally, a CPU is a giant collection of interconnected logic gates
that consist of tiny electrically operated switches. With that in mind, I invite
you to consider the question: how does a CPU actually do arithmetic? For
example, how does it add two positive integers?
</p>

<p>
Turns out, you can wire together logic gates to make circuits that can perform
arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider adding two single-bit numbers. Forget about negative numbers for
now, let's just handle positives. Note that result itself can be larger than
1 bit, so we'll add a second, "carryover" bit to it. There are only 4
possibilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>0 + 0 = 0 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>0 + 1 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 0 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 1 = 0 in the result bit, 1 in the carryover bit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The pattern in the result bits looks like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a> for a
familiar boolean operation - exclusive OR (aka XOR). The pattern in the
carryover bit looks like the truth table of a boolean AND operation. So, a
circuit for adding two single-bit values can be built with a XOR gate and an AND
gate. It's called a half-adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/ha.png">
</p>

<p>
When we try adding two 2-bit numbers, things start to get real hairy. We need to
take into account the carryover bit from adding the first two bits when adding
the second two bits. So we can't just string together two half-adders to add two
2-bit numbers. We need to design a circuit that adds <i>three</i> bits: two 
"regular" bits and one carryover bit from the previous single-bit addition.
Such a circuit is called a full adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/fa.png">
</p>


<p>
By stringing together a half-adder and a full adder, we can finally get a
circuit that can add two-bit numbers:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/2-bit-addr.gif">
</p>

<p>
In general, by stringing together several full adders one after another, we can
build blocks for adding numbers with more bits. Such blocks are called
ripple-carry adders.

<p>I’ve been in a reflective mood lately, probably because it’s the end of a very eventful year. Change is all around us and technology is the enabler.</p>



<p>On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own experiences with technology-driven change in the reinsurance industry, where I worked as an analyst from 2017 until recently.</p>



<p>During these three short years, I observed a radical shift in data analysis methodologies. Excel-based models, which had seemed top-of-the-line suddenly were too slow and too rigid; Integration with 3rd party data sources, which was once a luxury, became the norm; And analysts began to utilize scripts to accomplish many labor-intensive tasks typically performed by hand or in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Enabling this change is a suite of accessible Python-powered tools. These technologies are rapidly displacing the old way of doing things, ushering in a new wave of reinsurance models and the talent needed to support them.</p>



<p>Admittedly, the following observations do come from a very niche industry. But I believe that the broader trends discussed here will also apply to other legacy companies and sectors.</p>



<p>In this post, I explore the following topics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> – An introduction to reinsurance</li><li><strong>Section 2 – </strong>The need for technological disruption in the reinsurance industry</li><li><strong>Sections 3 to 5</strong> – How Python is replacing Excel</li><li><strong>Section 6 </strong>– Arguments against adopting new technologies</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> – The evolution of the reinsurance industry</li></ul>



<p>If you are curious about the transition from Excel to Python but aren’t interested in reinsurance, skip to section 3.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="406" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>1. Reinsurance, from an analyst’s perspective</h2>



<p>Most people understand insurance, but few have heard of its rather exotic sounding cousin: reinsurance. So, before I begin, here’s a quick intro:</p>



<p>Just as individuals transfer risk to insurers in exchange for a premium, insurers too must mitigate their risk by transferring some or all of their liabilities to one or more reinsurance companies. This enables insurers to protect themselves in the case of a large event, such as a hurricane, which affects many individual policyholders. Without reinsurers, insurance companies would not be able to survive catastrophes and would be much more risk averse, ultimately impacting the end consumer.</p>



<p>Reinsurance programs come in a variety of flavors to suit the need of the reinsured. I’ll spare you the details but suffice it to say that all potential reinsurance programs must first be analyzed. In industry speak, this is the process of “pricing a deal”.</p>



<p>For each deal, brokers gather relevant data from the insurance companies and send it to potential reinsurers as a “submission”. It is the underwriting analyst’s responsibility to parse this data, enter it into Excel-based models and produce a number.</p>



<p>This number, the loss ratio, represents the expected loss divided by the total premium and typically ranges between 10% to 150+%. LRs above 100% mean that the premium is not sufficient to cover the losses that we expect based on our model. In other words, we’d be writing the deal at a loss.</p>



<p>In reality, reinsurance companies have pricing hurdles well below 100% because they have other money outflows to account for such as brokerage (intermediary fees) and G&amp;A (general and administrative expenses).</p>



<p>The point is, Excel is the key piece of software that enables underwriting teams to assess new business. Throughout the company, different teams use different models, each with different processes and different pricing hurdles. But the one common theme is that all of the models are based on Excel spreadsheets. That’s just how the industry works. Everyone uses Excel for everything.</p>



<p>Well, until recently.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>2. Change is coming</h2>



<p>In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including:</p>



<ol><li>The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets</li><li>The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models</li><li>The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices</li></ol>



<p>Excel fails miserably at these tasks.</p>



<p>First, expressing complex reinsurance deals requires tabs and tabs of structural details, interlinking formulas and limiting assumptions. It’s a mess to build and a headache to understand. Have a lot of data? That’s more tabs and formulas to add to the model. Performance slows dramatically and minutes of your life are wasted waiting for bloated spreadsheets to finally open.</p>



<p>Second, you’re forced to use the VBA programming language if you want to query external data or implement user-defined functionality. According to one Stack Overflow survey, VBA ranked “most dreaded” of all the languages, which wholly sums up my feelings. The development environment is not user friendly, the syntax confusing, there’s no support for unit testing –&nbsp;I could go on.</p>



<p>Third, Excel is fragile. Views and logic are intermingled, making it very hard to troubleshoot errors. Also, models aren’t put into source control, so you can’t restore an old version. Massive spreadsheets with dozens of tabs frequently crash without warning, much to the dismay of underwriting analysts (like myself).</p>



<p>During my three years in reinsurance, I witnessed a dire need for new tooling. And, from what I observed, it is clear that this tooling will be powered by Python.</p>







<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>3. The future is Python</h2>



<p>As a technical underwriting analyst with programming skills, I was among the first to build and benefit from what I think are the next generation of pricing tools. These tools fall into two main categories:</p>



<ul><li>Excel models running Python code</li><li>Python notebooks in the browser</li></ul>



<p>Both options offer enhanced analysis capabilities while still catering to a non-technical or semi-technical end user.</p>



<p>Now, let’s explore each technology in more detail.</p>



<h2>4. Excel models running Python code</h2>



<p>The first category of new technology is based on augmentation. Rather than adding VBA code to your Excel spreadsheet, you can use Python instead. This is possible thanks to 3rd party Excel add-ins such <a href="https://www.pyxll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyXLL</a>, which brings the power of Python data analysis into the humble spreadsheet.</p>



<p>When you open Excel, the add-in makes your Python code accessible either as functions or as macros. This means that you can write Python code in the development environment of your choice, add unit tests, integrate with 3rd party libraries and push to source control.</p>



<p>PyXLL facilitated a step change in how we construct reinsurance models. Specifically, here’s how our setup looked before and after augmenting our model with Python:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Python</strong></td><td><strong>After Python</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We used an Excel spreadsheet-based model with dozens of tabs containing complex formulas, endless pivot tables and unintelligible VBA code.</td><td>The tangled mess of VBA was re-written into independent Python modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</td></tr><tr><td>The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open.</td><td>The Excel spreadsheet is now just a view, so it is lightweight and quick to open.</td></tr><tr><td>There was no visibility into errors. “Debugging” meant manually breaking apart lengthy Excel formulas.</td><td>The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently.</td></tr><tr><td>We were limited by the assumptions made when the model was first created, with little ability to add new features.</td><td>The codebase lives in source control, enabling multiple collaborators to work in tandem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developers can use their preferred development environment.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A robust peer review process helps to perpetuate high quality code.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Using PyXLL, we built an underwriting pricing model powered entirely by Python code. We were able to express structural complexities of deals at a level never before achieved. And we were able to add simulation-based pricing techniques that simply cannot be done using spreadsheets alone.</p>



<p>The impact of PyXLL on how we build models and ultimately price business cannot be understated.</p>



<p>Which leads us to the second technology that is changing the way we perform underwriting data analysis…</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>5. Python notebooks in the browser</h2>



<p>The second novel approach to reinsurance risk assessment and pricing is enabled via Python notebooks. These are web-based documents that can contain narrative text, live code, charts and visuals, plus results from your data analysis. </p>



<p>Python notebooks are all about collaboration, visualization and rapid iteration. They are a way to execute code with minimal setup and overhead, making it easier for new programmers to explore data outside of Excel. One of my favorite parts of notebooks is how easy it is to access your data, whether that’s from a file, SQL databases or an external source.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what a data analysis project looked like for me with and without Python notebooks:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Without Python Notebooks</strong></td><td><strong>With Python Notebooks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Manually query SQL databases and copy data into Excel. Keep data fresh by re-querying SQL and copying in new data.</td><td>Drop in a csv file, connect directly to an internal SQL database or utilize a 3rd party API to retrieve external data.</td></tr><tr><td>Perform analysis using Excel functions, pivot tables and VBA code. Functions quickly became unwieldy and difficult to troubleshoot.</td><td>Manipulate data easily and rapidly using Python libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborate with a colleague by closing Excel and letting your colleague know that the spreadsheet is available for them to work on.</td><td>Collaborate with colleagues by sharing the notebook.</td></tr><tr><td>Copy tabular results and charts into Word or Powerpoint and add written narrative as necessary.</td><td>Export results to csv or generate professional-looking PDFs to give directly to key stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Add explanatory narrative directly to the document alongside related code blocks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Create interactive charts and static visuals using libraries like <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plotly</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seaborn</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matplotlib</a>.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leverage existing libraries like <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SciPy</a> or <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scikit-learn</a> to …</td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Over the past decade or two, behavioural scientists have had a great ride. There have been bestselling books and Nobel Memorial Prizes. Every second government department and corporate has set up a team.</p>
<p>But recently, the wind seems to have changed. We’re told that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/behavioral-economics-latest-bias-seeing-bias-wherever-it-looks">behavioural economics is itself biased</a>.</p>

<p>I believe this challenge is deserved.</p>
<p>For too long we have been opining about people’s irrationality – that is, the irrationality of others – and that if only we designed the world more intelligently, people would make better decisions.</p>
<p>We often make these judgements based on narrow lab experiments that we generalise to the outside world. But as we well know, sometimes those experiments don’t replicate in that narrow lab environment. And even of those that replicate in the lab, many become an ineffective, or even dangerous tool when we try to apply them in the complex outside world.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story to illustrate.</p>
<h2>The hot hand fallacy</h2>
<p>This story comes from great <a href="https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14943">work by&nbsp;Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo</a>. It stands as one of the starkest examples of where I have been forced to change my beliefs.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence from the lab that people have misperceptions about what randomness looks like. When a person is asked to generate a series that approximates the flipping of a coin, they will alternate between heads and tails too often, and balance the frequencies of heads and tails over too short a sequence. When people are asked to judge which of two different sequences of coin flips are more likely, they tend to pick sequences with more alternation, despite their probability being the same.</p>
<p>What happens we look for a failure to perceive randomness in the outside world? Out of the lab?</p>
<p>When people watch basketball, they often see a hot hand. They will describe players as “hot” and “in form”. Their belief is that the person who has just hit a shot or a series of shots is more likely to hit their next one.</p>
<p>But is this belief in the “hot hand” a rational belief? Or is the hot hand an illusion, whereby, just like they do with coins, they are seeing streaks in what is actually randomness?</p>
<p>In a famous examination of this question, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6">Thomas Gilovich,&nbsp;Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky</a> took shot data from a variety of sources, including the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics, and examined it for evidence of a hot hand.</p>
<p>What did they find? The hot hand was an illusion. As Daniel Kahneman wrote in <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> when describing this research:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The hot hand is entirely in the eye of the beholders, who are consistently too quick to perceive order and causality in randomness. The hot hand is a massive and widespread cognitive illusion.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Possibly even more interesting was the reaction to the findings from those in the sporting world. Despite the analysis, many sports figures denied that it could be true. Red Auerbach, who coached the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships, <a href="http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL15_SP_1991_Article_02.pdf">said</a> “Who is this guy? So he makes a study. I couldn’t care less.”</p>
<p>This provides another insight, about which Gilovich wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]he story of our research on the hot hand is only partly about the misperception of random events. It is also about how tenaciously people cling to their beliefs even in the face of hostile evidence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, this isn’t just about the misperception of the hot hand, but also about the failure of people to see their error when presented with evidence about it.</p>
<p>Let’s delve into how Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky showed the absence of a hot hand.</p>
<p>Imagine a person who took ten shots in a basketball game. A ball is a hit, an X is a miss.</p>
<p>What would count as evidence of a hot hand? What we can do is look at shots following a previous hit. For instance, in this sequence of shots there are 6 occasions where we have a shot following a previous hit. Five of those shots, such as the seventh here, are followed by another hit.</p>
<p>We can then compare their normal shooting percentage with the proportion of shots they hit if the shot immediately before was a hit. If their hit rate after a hit is higher than their normal shot probability, then we might say they get a hot hand.</p>
<p>This is effectively how Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky examined the hot hand in coming to their conclusion that it doesn’t exist. They also looked at whether there was a hit or miss after longer streaks of hits or misses, but this captures the basic methodology. It seems sensible.</p>
<p>But let me take a detour that involves flipping a coin.</p>
<p>Suppose you flip a coin three times. Here are the eight possible sequences of heads and tails. Each sequence has an equal probability of occurring. What if I asked you: if you were to flip a coin three times, and there is a heads followed by another flip in that sequence, what is the expected probability that another heads will follow that heads?</p>
<p>Here is the proportion of heads following a previous flip of heads for each sequence. In the first row of the table, the first flip is a head. That first flip is followed by another head. After the second flip, a head, we also have a head. There is no flip after the third head. 100% of the heads in that sequence followed by another flip are followed by a head.</p>
<p>In the second row of the table, 50% of the heads are followed by a head. In the last two rows, there are no heads followed by another flip.</p>
<p>Now, back to our question: if you were to flip a coin three times, and there is a heads followed by another flip in that sequence, what is the expected probability that another heads will follow that heads? It turns out it is 42%, which I can get by averaging those proportions.</p>
<p><strong>8 possible combinations of heads and tails across three flips</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Flips</strong></th>
<th><strong>p(H<sub>t+1</sub>|H<sub>t</sub>)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>HHH</td>
<td>100%</td>

<tr>
<td>HHT</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>TTT</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Expected value</strong></td>
<td><strong>42%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That doesn’t seem right. If we count across all the sequences, we see that there are 8 flips of heads that are followed by another flip. Of the subsequent flips, 4 are heads and 4 are tails, spot on the 50% you expect.</p>
<p>What is going on in that second column? By looking at these short sequences, we are introducing a bias. The cases of heads following heads tend to cluster together, such as in the first sequence which has two cases of a heads following a heads. Yet the sequence THT, which has only one shot occurring after a heads, is equally likely to occur. The reason a tails appears more likely to follow a heads is because of this bias whereby the streaks tend to cluster together. The expected value I get when taking a series of three flips is 42%, when in fact the actual probability of a heads following a heads is 50%. As the sequence of flips gets longer, the size of the bias is reduced, although it is increased if we examine longer streaks, such as the probability of a heads after three previous heads.</p>
<p>Why have I bothered with this counterintuitive story about coin flipping?</p>
<p>Because this bias is present in the methodology of the papers that purportedly demonstrated that there was no hot hand in basketball. Because of this bias, the proportion of hits following a hit or sequence of hits is biased downwards. Like our calculation using coins, the expected proportion of hits following a hit in a sequence is lower than the actual probability of hitting a shot.</p>
<p>Conversely the hot hand pushes the probability of hitting a shot after a previous hit up. Together, the downward bias and the hot hand roughly cancelled each other out, leading to the conclusion by researchers that each shot is independent of the last.</p>
<p>The result is, that when you correct for the bias, you can see that there actually is a hot hand in basketball.</p>
<p>When Miller and Sanjurjo crunched the numbers for one of the studies in the Gilovich and friends paper, they found that the probability of hitting a shot following a sequence of three previous hits is 13 percentage points higher than after a sequence of three misses. There truly is a hot hand. If Red Auerbach had coached as though there were no hot hand, what would his record have looked like?</p>
<p>I should say, this point does not debunk the earlier point about people misperceiving randomness. The lab evidence is strong. People tend to see the hot hand when people flip coins. It is possible that people overestimate the strength of the hot hand in the wild, although that is hard to show. But the hot hand exists.</p>
<p>Let’s turn back to one of the quotes I showed earlier.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]he story of our research on the hot hand is only partly about the misperception of random events. It is also about how tenaciously people cling to their beliefs even in the face of hostile evidence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers expanded the original hot hand research from a story about people misperceiving randomness, to one of them continuing to do so even when presented with evidence that they were making an error.</p>
<p>But, as we can now see, their belief in the hot hand was not an error. The punters in the stands were right. Their accumulated experience had given them the answer. The researchers were wrong. Rather than the researchers asking whether they themselves were making an error when people refused to believe their research, they double downed and identified a second failure of human reasoning. The blunt dismissal of people’s beliefs led behavioural scientists to hold an untrue belief for over thirty years</p>
<p>This is a persistent characteristic of much applied behavioural science. It was an error I made many times when I first came to the discipline. We spend too little time questioning our  understanding of the decisions or observations other people make. If we believe they are in error, we should first question whether the error is ours.</p>
<h2>Priming</h2>
<p>Here’s another example. There is a body of behavioural science research known as priming, that suggests …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Matestack Ui Core Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>In this step-by-step guide, I will show you how to create a Twitter clone in pure Ruby with Matestack, following the great screencasts from Chris McCord <a href="https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI">Phoenix LiveView Twitter Clone</a> and Nate Hopkins <a href="https://youtu.be/F5hA79vKE_E">Stimulus Reflex Twitter Clone</a>. We will use the Gem <code>matestack-ui-core</code>, which enables us to implement our UI in some Ruby classes rather than writing ERB, HAML or Slim views. Furthermore we don't need to touch JavaScript in order to create reactive UI features, such as updating the DOM without a full browser page reload or syncing multiple web clients through Action Cable!</p>

<p>I've added a screencast (two parts) showing you what you will be doing in this tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mue5gs6Wtq4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Mue5gs6Wtq4/0.jpg" width="350"></a></p>

<p><em>This guide utilizes the full power of Matestack and uses <code>matestack-ui-core</code> as a complete substitute for Rails views. If you only want to create UI components in pure Ruby on existing Rails views, please check out <a href="https://docs.matestack.io/docs/ui_components/100-rails_integration">this guide</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"> 

<p>browser-extension-reload is a server, userChrome scripts for Firefox and a Sublime Text plug-in it uses WebSocket.</p>

<p>When you load Firefox it will send the list of add-ons with their respective ids and paths to Sublime Text and as you make change to your files it will match the file path against the ones sent by the server.</p>

<p>You can have multiple directories watched for a single extension and you can load as many extensions as you want.</p>

<p>The tutorial is in three parts: server, userChrome (Firefox) and the Sublime Text plug-in.</p>

<p>Please read the carefully the README of each repository as you go.</p>



<ul>
  <li><code>git clone https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-server</code></li>
  <li><code>npm install</code></li>
  <li><code>npm start</code></li>
</ul>



<p>See <a href="https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-firefox/">https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-firefox/</a></p>



<p>See <a href="https://gist.github.com/thoughtsunificator/12e18fb559e7f3e274574bcf4ce3dcb7">https://gist.github.com/thoughtsunificator/12e18fb559e7f3e274574bcf4ce3dcb7</a></p>



<p>You must run the server first then Firefox and finally Sublime Text.</p>

<p>It will not work if you do not respect this order.</p></article></div>]]>

It’s been that way since the beginning of the ’00s and back then I spent a lot of time configuring my prompt to be a good balance between compact/readable and useful. I found that I dislike fancy two-line prompts, information on a right-hand side (because of its awkward behavior), and stuff like that. So the result looks like that:</p>
<pre><code>piranha@rigel ~&gt; █
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>█</code> is a cursor. It shows username, <code>@</code> to separate it from hostname - or <span><code>#</code></span> if this is uid 0 shell, then hostname, and a home-abbreviated path. One of the fancy things is that space before the cursor is Unicode glyph <code>\u00A0</code> - non-breaking space - which is bound in ZLE to delete everything to the beginning of a line. Unfortunately, this does not work with Terminal.app, so it just sits there waiting for a better time. This setup along with colors had no changes for over a decade.</p>
<p>But a week ago a saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1316081732467081217">tweet</a> with an idea to change prompt’s prompt (the <code>&gt;</code> thingie) to a red color when previous command exited with an error status. This motivated me to cleanup and update my prompt to a newer conventions. This is a result:</p>
<p><img alt="prompt screenshot" src="https://solovyov.net/media/prompt.jpg" height="60px" width="127px"></p>
<p>You can see I removed my username since it really gives me no information, no reason to spend space on that. I also really like white background, but if you don’t, changing colors is easy — I’ll explain how everything works.</p>
<p>Let’s break down it bit by bit. The prompt syntax is a little hard on the eyes - in case if you have ideas on how to write this so next time I won’t have to dig deep into ZSH documentation, I’ll be glad to listen.</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, few things are interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%(x.if-true.if-false)</code> construct (documented <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Conditional-Substrings-in-Prompts">here</a>) shows either <code>@</code> if I’m a normal user or a red <span><code>#</code></span> if I’m a root.</li>
<li><code>!</code> there means “True if the shell is running with privileges”.</li>
<li>You can clearly see <code>@</code> after the second dot, but what does <code>%F{red}%B#%b%f</code> mean? <code>%B</code> means “start bold”, <code>%b</code> means “end bold”.</li>
<li><code>%F</code>/<code>%f</code> duo is “start/stop color” - it can either accept old-style color numbers (where 1 is red) or color names, which is easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
</code></pre>
<p>Those are easy to understand, just refer to <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html">documentation</a> — <code>%m</code> is a hostname before the first dot, <code>%~</code> is a path where <code>$HOME</code> is abbreviated to <code>~</code>.</p>
<pre><code>p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'
</code></pre>
<p>This is a new part. <code>?</code> means “True if exit status of the last command was 0”. So if a command exited nicely (with a status code 0), then it’s going to be blue <span><code>&gt;</code></span>, in other case it’s going to be red <span><code>&gt;</code></span>. Voila! :-)</p>
<p>End result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'

PS1="$p_at$p_host $p_path$p_pr "
unset p_at p_host p_path p_pr
</code></pre>
<p>You can see I’m unsetting color in every variable and unset those variables — cleaning up after yourself is a valuable habit, especially with a shell. :-)</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the same could be done for bash (or tclsh, or whatever), but I’m not using it so… If anybody wants to contribute a similar configuration for other shells, I’ll gladly link to a post or add it here.</p>

<p>Many people are looking for a habit tracker bullet journal guide or example. In this post, I’m going to show you how I take the spirit of the bullet journal concept and apply it to Roam Research.</p>



<p>There are many things that can be tracked, but for my example I’m going to show you what I track and how I track it. I’ll also give you the exact “code” I use so you can set this up yourself to create your own habit tracker bullet journal for Roam.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll make it a habit to<a aria-label=" take good notes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-good-notes-part1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> take good notes</a>, which I think could be a life-changing habit to add to your life.</p>

<p>Famed management guru Peter Drucker said it best.</p>



<blockquote><p>What gets measured, gets managed.</p><cite>Peter Drucker</cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if you want to create lasting change in your life, you need to start tracking your habits and becoming “aware”. The truth is you already are relying on habits to run your life. It’s the nature of being human that we rely on habits to reduce our cognitive load.</p>



<p>By becoming conscious of our habits, we can track them and over time get rid of old habits and create new habits. But the key is that we must be aware and we must track. Otherwise, we will slide back into our “old ways” and the change we seek will stop.</p>



<h3><span id="What_Should_I_Track_With_My_Habit_Tracker_Bullet_Journal">What Should I Track With My Habit Tracker Bullet Journal?</span></h3>



<p>There are so many things that you can track, the list is really up to you. However, in general, there are a few areas that most of us should be tracking. I’m going to list out for you now what I am presently tracking.</p>



<p><strong>List Of Habits To Track:</strong></p>



<p>Supplements/Medicines:</p>

<p>Now, if you are using Roam Research yet then you need to go sign up. It’s relatively inexpensive and it can absolutely change your life. It’s a sort of note taking tool that really has changed my entire life.</p>

<p>And I also want to say that I didn’t create this idea of Habit Tracking in Roam. I watched a lot of Youtube Videos about this and the ones that were most helpful were <a aria-label="Anonym.s  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2Dh3N7QpuZP6LLhUMkMqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonym.s </a>and <a aria-label="Shu Omi.

<iframe title="How To Track Habits Using Roam Research [[Walkthrough]]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6VWMFZqA3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Here’s a video walkthrough if you prefer learning that way.</figcaption></figure><p>What you want to do is to create a table inside of Roam. You can create a table by typing /table and pressing enter.</p>



<p>You will then see something that looks like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="490" height="253" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table.png 490w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"></figure><p>Underneath the table, you will then want to create the things you want to track. For my sample, I will use my Supplements tracking.</p>



<p>Make sure you tab over one to the right so that you are indented underneath the table (The blank bullet in my screenshot). Press tab to indent.</p>



<p>Start by giving a name to what you will be tracking. In my case, I will type “Supplements”. You should now see this is the top left name of the table. </p>



<p>Now, press enter and tab over one and type out Monday. Press enter, tab again, and type Tuesday. Do this until you have completed the days of the week. Note that you can start on any day of the week you want or you could do this weekly if you wanted like Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, etc.</p>



<p>When done it should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="354" height="234" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week.png 354w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></figure><p>If you look at your Table now, you will have 8 column titles… starting with Supplements and running all the way through Sunday.</p>



<p>Now that we have the columns, we need to start putting in the rows. To do that, press enter again and use “shift + tab” until your bullet is now even again with “Supplements”. Then type the first thing you want to track. You should keep these all on the same indentation just pressing enter after each one.</p>



<p>In my case I would type:</p>



<p>Testosterone (enter)<br>DECA (enter)<br>HCG (enter)<br>AI Blocker (enter)<br>Vitamin D (enter)<br>In Perium (enter)<br>Collagen (enter)<br>Fortagen (enter)</p>



<p>At this point you’ll see that you have rows and colums and it should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="825" height="332" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table.png 825w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table-300x121.png 300w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table-768x309.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px"></figure><p>If you have any extra rows showing up at this point that’s ok. It should fix itself when we do the final step here which is to add a checkbox so we can mark a field as “complete”. </p>



<p>To do this, we want to go back to the  different things we want to track. Let’s start with Testosterone again. Click on the Testosterone line and press enter. Now tab one over. If you had any weird formatting issues, they should be gone now.</p>



<p>What we want do to now is add a checkmark that can be toggled On/Off. Thankfully, this feature is built into Roam Research.</p>



<p>So go ahead and type /todo and this will create a checkbox for you. If you are feeling fancy you can also type the code in directly which is {{[[TODO]]}} or you can hit CMD Enter or CRTL Enter and this will also insert the TO DO box.</p>



<p>Press enter and tab over again. Insert the TODO code. Do this again and again (enter and tab) and you should see the checkboxes being added underneath the day of the week. </p>



<p>It should look like this when done:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="313" height="232" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes.png 313w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px"></figure><p>And your Table should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="820" height="78" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo.png 820w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo-300x29.png 300w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo-768x73.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></figure><p>To finish off the table, you will just repeat the same step again underneath each of the things you are tracking.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you, you can “cheat” and use this code below. Although, I recommend doing it yourself a few times so you know how to better tweak it later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p>
<p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p>
<p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p>
<p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p>
<p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p>
<p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p>
<p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p>
<p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when youâ€™re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p>
<p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote>
<p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p>
<p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p>
<p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p>
<p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p>
<p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Promotional text:

Over the holidays, spent some time reflecting on the past 7 years of Sourcegraph and the state of developer tools in general. Very excited to see what the future holds (and to bring the future sooner with our work). It's time to buildâ€”developer tools: https://beyang.org/time-to-build-dev-tools.html

-->
<h2><span>It's time to build developer tools</span><span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2020.12.29</span></h2>
<p>We are living through a golden age in developer tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+is+eating+the+world">Software is eating the world</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=every+company+is+a+software+company">Every company is now a software company</a>.</p>
<p>Every software company needs developers—and developer tools.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of companies building tools for developers is booming. If you are a developer who loves the art and craft of programming, if you like working on <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/optimizing-a-code-intel-indexer/">technical problems beyond scaling CRUD</a>, or if you love the idea of accelerating technological progress by building tools for people like yourself, you should think about working on dev tools!</p>
<h2>Historic forces, immense opportunity</h2>
<p>Every company that now writes code has discovered (or is discovering) that software development is really tricky. The world needs more software, but it’s not as simple as hiring more developers. Building software doesn’t scale or parallelize easily. Serial dependencies coupled with unforeseen complexity lead to gross underestimates of timeline and budget, which in turn lead to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them">bad</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-so-many-high-profile-digital-transformations-fail">business</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/heres-why-ge-fords-digital-transformation-programs-failed-last-year.html">outcomes</a> and even <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/08/19/10-great-companies-that-lost-their-edge">existential</a> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp">crises</a>.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of developing software quickly and efficiently at scale, more and more companies are building and buying developer tools. It’s no longer just the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts, and Amazons of the world spending serious money doing so.</p>
<p>To satisfy this increasingly apparent need, a rapidly growing new industry of developer tool companies has arisen in recent years. Individual names like GitHub, GitLab, and HashiCorp are now well known and the emergence of the field has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/16/developer-tools-quietly-become-a-growth-story/">not</a> <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/rise-of-the-developer">gone</a> <a href="https://alven.co/the-debrief-go-to-market-in-dev-tools-part-1/">unnoticed</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate how quickly the market for developer tools has grown in the past decade.
When Quinn and I started Sourcegraph back in 2013, we quickly discovered that “dev tool” was a dirty word among investors. Developer tools, it was thought, were super valuable, but most of them were single player tools that didn’t make enough money (e.g., JetBrains, Sublime Text), internal tools built for the specific needs of a particular big tech company (e.g., Google Code Search), or open-source projects that no one paid for and which you could only make money from by selling services and support. Investors told us there was just one billion-dollar company that sold to developers—Red Hat—and it was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>Developers were building lots of valuable software that was sold to other folks—salespeople, marketers, designers, etc.—but when it came to their own work, the common refrain was, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes">“the cobbler’s children have no shoes”</a>. An article in TechCrunch lamented, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/22/will-developer-tools-startups-ever-find-investors/">“Will Developer Tools Startups Ever Find Investors?"</a></p>
<p>But then, somewhere along the line of the past seven years, something changed. Evidence of this shift is in the valuations: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">GitHub acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/-gitlab-valued-over-6-billion-in-secondary-share-sale.html">GitLab valued at $6 billion</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/hashicorp-soars-above-5b-valuation-in-new-175m-venture-round/">HashiCorp at $5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/czech-startup-founders-turn-billionaires-without-vc-help">JetBrains estimated at $7 billion</a>, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But though the big numbers with lots of zeroes raise eyebrows and make the headlines, they are just the byproduct of the underlying factors driving big changes in where and how software is built. To list a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Competition from Big Tech and tech-enabled startups moving into every industry is driving every company to prioritize software as a core competency.</li>
<li><strong>Big Code:</strong> The amount of code in the world has been growing rapidly, and more and more companies have reached a tipping point previously reached only by the largest tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise OSS:</strong> The maturation of “the cloud” as a software platform built on top of open-source software (Linux and Kubernetes), in contrast to older software platforms, which were vertically integrated proprietary ecosystems (e.g., Windows + .NET + Visual Studio).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other trends at play here, but one thing is certain: almost every valuable or growing company is now building software and most have realized they need great developer tools to compete.</p>
<p>This is fantastic news. “Tech” has traditionally been a distinct sector of the economy, and the ability to build software effectively at scale was confined to a handful of big technology companies. Now, companies in every sector understand that code has to become a core part of their DNA. And this means the impact of code and software is amplified. No longer does the value proposition of software have to flow through some product or service offered by a “tech company”—companies across every sector of the economy are now learning how to build great software themselves.</p>
<p>As the broader economy learns to build software, progress will accelerate. All the promises that the future holds—<a href="https://grail.com/">cures for cancer</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">life-saving</a> <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/">medicine</a>, <a href="http://uber.com/">mass</a> <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">individualized</a> <a href="https://comma.ai/">transportation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-rockets-fly-with-software-you-can-find-on-your-android-phone/">rocketships</a>, and more—will arrive sooner in large part thanks to code. Software has long been recognized as a technological accelerant. But developer tools are now a <em>second-order accelerant</em> on technological progress. This is an immense opportunity.</p>
<p>How best to pursue it?</p>
<h2>Large companies, open source, and startups</h2>
<p>There are three places where you can work on developer tools. (There may be more, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on these.)</p>
<p>The first is inside a large non-developer-tool company. Many large companies that build software are investing heavily in internal tools. There have been a lot of great dev tools created inside large companies, and many such tools have inspired the creation of similar tools outside the company. Blaze, the build system of Google, inspired other build systems like Pants and Facebook’s Buck and was later itself open-sourced as Bazel. Large companies also offer the benefit of a large, stable salary. The downside is that the direct impact of your work will likely be limited to a single organization. It’s possible that your work will be open-sourced down the road, but there is no guarantee, and it can often take years to get the necessary legal and bureaucratic approvals to do so. And, of course, you don’t have a direct piece of the financial upside if the tool becomes super widely used.</p>
<p>The second place you can build dev tools is on an open-source project. Working in the open guarantees you will receive recognition for your work, and you also have the benefit of not having any pesky pricing considerations standing in between your users and your product. If mass adoption is your primary goal, then open source holds great appeal. Many of the most widely used developer tools—Git, Linux, Emacs, Vim, etc.—are open source projects. The downside, of course, is lack of revenue. Most open-source authors and maintainers have an alternate source of income (often working at a large tech company). Patreon and GitHub Sponsors are great, but it’s likely that only a small fraction of open-source creators will ever earn enough to make a comfortable living through sponsorship alone. The number of hours you can devote to working on open source will be constrained by where you can find sources of income.</p>
<p>The third place is at a developer tools company. Most such companies will be startups, because of the rapid growth in market size for dev tools over the past few years. Dev tools companies offer the benefit of aligned incentives: your users, your customers, and even your fellow engineering teammates are often the same people. If you build a great tool, then your users are happy, you get paid so you are also happy, and you and your teammates can also make use of the same tool, so that should make you doubly happy! Dev tool startups have the additional benefit of financial upside (assuming part of your compensation is an equity stake in the business). This upside could be substantial. Personally, I think we are in the early days of the developer tools market. I believe the impact of high-quality, broadly useful dev tools will someday far exceed the impact of <a href="https://www.google.com/">ads-driven web search</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">PC operating systems</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/">social media</a>. Which is to say, I think that the value of developer tool companies will someday exceed the combined value of the most valuable tech companies today.</p>
<p>Of course, startups also carry a downside risk. There is a high chance that the company will fail to meet its lofty goals, or may need to lay people off, or fail completely. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the best place to work. Personally, the principle I follow is, “Maximize expected utility subject to minimizing the risk of ruin,” where the definition of “utility” and “ruin” is up to you to define.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you opt for large companies, open source, or dev tool startups, there is still the question of how to evaluate which specific opportunities and tools are worthy of your time. For that, you’ll need to rely on a combination of intuition and worldview, which we’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2>Scratch your own itch, but understand the big picture</h2>
<p>Jamie Zawinski once said, “The best motivator in the world is scratching your own itch.” He was talking about developer tools, and he was right. Most developer tools start with a programmer noticing they have a problem, imagining a way to fix the problem through software automation, and then writing the code that implements that automation. Building for yourself means you get to wear the hat of product manager, engineer, and customer simultaneously. This is a fantastic recipe for building something truly useful, not just for yourself, but for other people who feel the same pain. As you evaluate the landscape of enterprise developer tools, you should rely heavily on your own intuition for where pain points exist and which products offer effective solutions.</p>
<p>However, you’ll also want to combine your direct intuition with a broader view of how software development works—what is common across companies and sectors and what is different and specific to the segment of the market you are building for. It’s important to understand where your itch fits into the overall picture, how others experience that itch, and how <em>their</em> itch fits into <em>their</em> picture.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bb49bdb516c4ad0f99fa5fc3909b4f5caf8d5253/1dd14/images/uploads/ad-test-results-2.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

        <p>This post is for everyone who is trying to start a company right now. </p><p>The headlines make it seem easy. </p><p>20 year old kids raising millions of dollars to build the next Snapchat. Smug digital nomads posted up on a beach in Thailand making $75k/month. That lifestyle design dude who made $200k selling a Twitter course this year. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's fucking hard. </strong></p><p>At least it was for me. </p><p>I wanted to be a millionaire by 30. I was broke at 25. </p><p>I launched dozens of products, navigated through the minefield, and came out of it with business that exceeded all my expectations - millions in annual recurring revenue. </p><p>Here's the true story. </p><h2 id="year-0-inspiration-">Year 0 (inspiration)</h2><p>About 10 years ago I unofficially graduated university. </p><p>I had the credits to finish early, but stuck around to take one last class. That class </p><p>New Venture Design - it paired up business and engineering students to build a company. </p><p>That class changed my life.</p><p>My accounting major put me in the "useless business guy" category, so I consciously recruited the only two software engineers in the class. </p><p>The project we dreamed up was a daylighting system for commercial office buildings we called Luminex. </p><p>Essentially, reflective venetian blinds that tracked the sun and automatically reflected light into the ceiling - so you can work at your computer with natural light and no glare. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-5.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png 625w"><figcaption>Rendering of the project</figcaption></figure><p>Still one of my best ideas. </p><p>Instead of testing it in the market, the primary objective of that class was to compete in business plan competitions. Which just means pitching to students and professors. It had nothing to do with building a successful business. </p><p>We won three competitions - &nbsp;taking home $15,000 in prize money. </p><p>It was a great way to cap off my university career. </p><p>We graduated in May 2011, and decided to pursue the idea full-time. </p><h2 id="year-1-optimism-">Year 1 (optimism)</h2><p>One school never paid out their $5000 prize (thanks for nothing, UNBC!). </p><p>So with $10,000 in winnings to our name, we were ready to take on the world. </p><p>Along with our business plan competition spoils, I personally had $8,000 saved. </p><p><strong>I never considered getting a real job. </strong></p><p>I didn't jive with the dogma business school pushed on its impressionable young students. Recruiting events with a bunch of 20 year olds putting on suits to impress 23 year olds in suits for the privilege of making $40k/year working 80 hours a week. &nbsp;The weird reverence for McKinsey and KPMG. </p><p>I had some experience making my own money - running a window cleaning company that grossed $45k one summer - and once you've charged your friends out for $30/hr and paid them $15, it's hard to imagine working for anyone else. </p><p>The three of us were ready to build a hardware company. With $10,000. </p><p>A month after jumping into the abyss, we quickly realized we had no idea what we were doing and no money to do it with. The extent of our market validation was a few random people telling us our idea was good, and a prototype with some really decent software on it. </p><p>It took 3 months to realize it was never going to work. One engineer quit. </p><p>We were down to a partnership with no plan, no direction, no strategy, and no money. Yet, I still had a weird optimism that I'd figure it out. </p><p>I made $7,000 this year. </p><h2 id="year-2-survival-">Year 2 &nbsp;(survival)</h2><p>At the time, I was living in an amazing downtown apartment with two friends. </p><p>We squeezed 3 of us into a 2 bedroom + den apartment, on a grandfathered $2200/mo lease. My share was $800. </p><p>My friends all had real jobs at this point, but it never crossed my mind to get one. </p><p>I didn't want to move back home. I didn't want to get a job. I didn't even know what a job looked like (still don't!). </p><p>My only goals were to make that rent payment, drink a few beers, try to meet women, and eat. My business partner and I turned to what we knew. </p><p>Craigslist. </p><p>More specifically, web development on Craigslist. </p><p>We started building average Wordpress websites for small businesses, averaging $1000 to $4000 per month in sales from posting ads on Craigslist. </p><p>To supplement that kinglike income, we also started blogging on Seeking Alpha - writing stock investment advice for $80-$300 per article. </p><figure><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/296864-apples-future-is-in-the-icloud"><div><p>Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing</p><p><img src="https://seekingalpha.com/samw/static/images/favicon-192x192.png"><span>SeekingAlpha</span></p></div><p><img src="https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png"></p></a></figure><p>I had never bought a stock, and here I was - writing about Apple's future. </p><p>I should have bought Apple stock. </p><p>We shipped dozens of projects. </p><p>A website that paired up students and businesses, an events listing website, a Wordpress theme directory, a platform that helped companies pre-test job applicants skills, and many other forgotten ones. </p><p>The worst one was probably office composting. </p><p>Urban Dirt picked up your organic waste (in a rented Zipcar, as I didn't own a vehicle), and dropped it off at a composting facility for $30/week. </p><p>We got 10 customers for that business, and nearly landed the contract for Rogers Arena (Home of the Canucks) through a cold call. Hundreds of dollars of revenue wasn't enough, so we decided to make a huge bet on making our own fertilizer out of used coffee grounds from Starbucks. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This image gives me shivers.</figcaption></figure><p>We spent weeks drying coffee grounds on homemade racks and packaging it in paper bags to sell at farmers markets. We sold $40 worth. </p><p>I rented my room out on AirBnB on the weekends and slept on my couch to make ends meet. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. </p><p>I made $30,000 in 2012. </p><h2 id="year-3-momentum-">Year 3 (momentum)</h2><p>To summarize - two years into my entrepreneurship journey I was somewhat scraping by building crappy websites for random businesses, blogging about stocks that I wasn't invested in, and slanging fertilizer. </p><p>Broke. </p><p>Depressed. </p><p>Yet, not ready to quit. </p><p>I don't remember the genesis, but one project we ended up building was an applicant tracking system. I'm sure I've told the story about how we wanted to hire for our web design agency and needed a way to track applicants so we built this software to solve our own problem. </p><p>That's a lie - our agency never hired anyone. We probably built that software because I saw it somewhere and it looked like something we could build. </p><p>Anyways, we built an applicant tracking system (it worked!) and I hustled my ass off to sign up customers. </p><p>A few companies (thanks Charlyne, Heidi, and Gord) believed in us enough to pay us a little bit of money for it. From there, we had a few more ideas around the recruitment space - again, likely borrowed. One idea was a really cool tool that helped asynchronously test out job applicants skills before they got hired. </p><p>Similar to Codility, but for everyone. </p><p>We couldn't get customers. People just wanted an applicant tracking system. </p><p>We tried to make that applicant tracking system sexier, by allowing companies to add pictures/videos of their companies to their job postings. Like Unbounce for your job postings. No one wanted it. </p><p>We got desperate. </p><p>To promote our product, we decided to host an online job fair. We dreamed up the idea for an online event where candidates could visit company "booths," chat with recruiters, and drop their resume. </p><p>We set a 6 week deadline to launch and promote it. </p><p>I hit the phones hard, and signed up 40 companies. My cofounder built the software. We got press in some of the countries' <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/bc-tech-fair-delivers-online-job-fair">biggest publications</a>. Thousands of candidates pre-registered for the event. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>We went live on 2pm on Monday, July 23rd. </p><p>Our servers crashed. </p><p>I punched a wall. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattfromlater">Matt</a> (who we were sharing an office space with) got our servers back up, and the site held together for a few hours. Overall it was a very average experience, but enough to get us on the radar of Growlab - Vancouver's version of YCombinator. </p><p>Growlab was a group of experienced entrepreneurs and mentors who invested $20,000 in startups with the goal of helping them raise more money. That online job fair got us on their radar, and we got into the program. </p><p>One minor issue - we had no idea what the fuck we were doing. </p><p>At this point we had 4 products in the market with a handful of users. </p><p>An applicant tracking system (~1k MRR) </p><p>Asyncronous skills testing (alpha product)</p><p>Unbounce for job postings (~50 users)</p><p>An online job fair platform (1 event) </p><p>We had no vision, and no direction. </p><p>Growlab invested $20,000. This was the most money I'd seen in a bank account in 3 years. If we met minimum criteria, the Business Development Bank of Canada would invest another $150,000 into the company after 3 months. &nbsp;</p><p>We decided to focus on KarmaHire - Unbounce for job postings. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1039w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It hurts my brain to think about trying to get that thing off the ground back then. </p><p>I tried everything. </p><p>Automatically creating job postings for companies on Indeed, and then sending them the postings. Cold calling from 7am to 8pm (on the damn PHONE). </p><p>I was under the gun, and nothing was working. </p><p>My stress levels were through the roof. I was telling a story every week to our investors that had a hint of truth to it, and failing to make that reality come true. </p><p>Unnamed mentor gave me some of the worst fucking advice I've gotten. </p><blockquote>"Never let the truth get in the way of a good story."</blockquote><p>I've always had a guilty conscience, and while by the letter of the law I was telling the truth - it hurt my soul to extrapolate tiny data points into a broad narrative. </p><p>My stress levels peaked one Wednesday in May. </p><p>I got to the office at 7am, ready to start cold-calling. I reached into my backpack and realized I forgot my laptop at home. </p><p>I cracked. </p><p>I stumbled out of the office in a daze, walking home with no regard for red lights or traffic laws. I nearly got hit by a car. Twice. </p><p>I was completely checked out. The only thing that brought me back to sanity was the fact that my Grandma picked up the phone when I called her. We talked about nothing of substance, but she told me she loved me. </p><p>I made it home and slept for 6 hours. And went back to work the next day. </p><p>We survived Growlab, and impressed the BDC enough to raise that $150,000. </p><p>It may have been the haircut more than the product. </p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgqK0Bi5lME?start=21&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The techiest of tech bros.</figcaption></figure><p>A lifeline, and a hint of validation. </p><p>Despite its challenges, Growlab accelerated my learning 10x.

    <section>
      <h4>Leon Wieseltier</h4>
      <h3>Steadying</h3>
      <p>For some time now it has felt like history is itself the pandemic. In our country and elsewhere, it has been in overdrive, teeming with evils, flush with collapses, abounding in fear and rage, a wounding contest between the sense of an ending and the sense of a beginning, between inertia and momentum, with all the terribilities of ages of transition. What is going has not yet gone and what is coming has not yet come. We have become connoisseurs of convulsion. At sea is our new sea.</p>
<p>For better and for worse, axioms and assumptions are dying everywhere around us. Such vertiginous hours always come with both clarities and confusions — there is no promise of illumination. The guidance we need in our circumstances will not be provided by the circumstances themselves: they are too many and too contradictory and too volatile; passion increasingly unconstrained and power increasingly unconstrained. As the sense of injustice grows, injustice seems to keep pace with it. There is a piercing sensation of flux, of uncontrollable effects and unmanageable consequences. The masks on our faces are emblems of an entire era of vulnerability. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep our heads. A disequilibrium of history demands an equilibrium of the mind. Steadiness in the midst of turbulence is not complicity with the existing order. It is precisely in such binges of history that we must teach ourselves to sort through the true and the false, the good and the bad, the continuities and the discontinuities, the right statues and the wrong statues, the humane and the utopian.</p>
<p>Everything will be different: this is a ubiquitous sentiment. In all our upheavals — social and epidemiological — so much seems to be wrong and so much seems to be slipping away that one may be forgiven for enjoying a fantasy of total change. All these horrors, all these outrages, all these marches, and the world stays the same? So the first thing that needs to be said in the effort to keep our heads is that everything never changes. More, the idea that everything will change usually plays into the hands of those who want nothing to change. The cycle of revolution and reaction has never been the most effective engine of progress. Nothing suits the interests of the old regime like utopianism. The thirst for change will not be slaked by the cheap whiskey of apocalyptic thinking. The only certain outcome of the apocalyptic temper is catharsis, and one way of describing the decline of our politics in recent decades is that it has increasingly become a politics of catharsis, in which crisis is met mainly by emotion. (Populism is just mass emotionalism, and the emotions are often ugly ones.) Apocalypse is not an analysis, it is the death of analysis. It sets the stage only for salvation, but salvation must never become a political goal. This is especially true in a democratic society, where the only saviors are, alas, ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the struggle against injustice imposes upon us a paradoxical psychology: it demands both impatience and patience. Impatience about injustice, patience about justice. This is hard to do. It looks too much like, and in many cases it may well be, complacence. It is certainly difficult to preach incrementalism to the injured. So why not be impatient about justice, too? There are historical and practical reasons why not. History is stained by tales of instantaneous justice, by the consequences of the rush to perfection, by the victims of the victims. The ethical calculus of means and ends is never teleologically suspended, if just causes are to remain just. Nor is it a quantitative calculus: when I first studied the modern history of the Jews I drew a variety of conclusions from the Dreyfus affair, and one of them, which was an important moment in my moral education, was that Zola and his comrades appropriately threw an entire country into crisis for the sake of <i>one man</i>. Similarly, due process is not a legal formality, a procedural exercise that slows the way to a satisfying climax; it is the very honor of a liberal society.</p>
<p>More concretely, the establishment of justice involves not only revisions in opinions but also revisions in institutions. A dreary point! But anyone who denies the institutional dimension, in all its exasperating machinery, is not serious about the change. Paroxysms, unlike laws, vanish. This was the year in which the campaign for racial justice found support in virtually all the sectors of American society, with the exception of the White House — an unprecedented national epiphany that cannot be dismissed as “performative”, because culture matters; but the road from protest to policy is long and winding. It is not a betrayal of the ideal of social justice to tread carefully and tenaciously, with a mastery of the scruples and the methods that would make a reform defensible and durable. Tenacity is what patience looks like in the middle of a struggle.</p>
<p>I will give an example of the complicated nature of the mentality of change. One of the consequences of recent social movements in America — #MeToo (which came also to my door, with its lesson and its recklessness) and Black Lives Matter—has been to reveal how poorly we understand each other. Or more precisely, they have exposed the extent to which the failure to understand others may be owed to the failure to understand oneself — the limitations of one’s own standpoint, the comfortable assumption that one appears to others as one wishes to appear to them, or to oneself. This is nonsense, though sometimes you learn so the hard way. There are limits to our epistemological jurisdiction. The failure to observe these limits is solipsism, and we all begin as solipsists, awaiting correction by social experience.</p>
<p>Our epistemological jurisdiction stops at the encounter with another person. She is another epistemological kingdom, not more perfect but certainly different, with something important to add, and a perceptual contribution to make. I may like to think that I am what I present myself to be, but I am also what she sees me to be, because she sees me as I cannot, or will not, see myself. I am never in control of my self-representation and never complete in my self-awareness. We always show more of ourselves than we think we do, which is why we may learn from the responses of others. We spill beyond our intentions and our conceits, and what we gain from this overflow is criticism.</p>
<p>But criticism, too, must be assessed critically – there is no exemption. The enlightenment that one acquires from the judgments of others is owed only to their accuracy. It is certainly not warranted by the belief that a person’s identity or socio-economic position or experience of hardship confers an absolute authority, a special relationship to truth, a vatic privilege. What a simple world it would be if pain were a sufficient guarantee of credibility. But it is not – indeed, the opposite is the case, pain is myopic and sees chiefly itself, which is one of the reasons it hurts. Finally we are all left with the modesty of our grasp. No whole classes of people are right and no whole classes of people are wrong.</p>
<p>The ineradicability of ambiguity from human relations, the ignorance of ourselves that accompanies our ignorance of others, the whole fallible heap, creates an urgent need for tolerance and, more strenuously, for forgiveness. Historians will record that in the early decades of the twenty-first century we became an unforgiving society, a society of furies, a society in search of guilt and shame, a society of sanctimonies and “struggle sessions” American-style. They will admire our awakening to prejudice but lament the sometimes prejudicial ways in which we acted on our progressive realizations. In this respect America should become more Christian. (There, I said it.) For all our elaborate culture of self-knowledge, for all the hectoring articulateness of our identity vocabularies, we are still, each of us, our own blind spots. We should welcome every person we meet as a small blow against blindness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://libertiesjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/insignia-break.png" width="300" height="127"></p>
<p>The partiality of perspective: this is the great teaching of the contemporary tumult. The problem is that we have not only begun to acknowledge our partiality, and the partiality of others, we have also begun to revere it, and this is a mistake. We are gagging on all our roots. If pain does not provide access to truth, neither does particularity. The worship of particularism is one of the great impediments to social justice, and in its exhilarating way it coarsens us all. In our moral and social thinking, our obsession with otherness has concealed that the foundation of moral and social action is sameness. The “other” is exotic, but there is nothing exotic about the homeless man on the street: he is the same as me, a human being, except that he is hungry and I am not. The difference in our circumstances is not a difference in our definition. When I hand him a few dollars I am not extending myself toward an alien being; I am practicing species solidarity. I am not discovering his humanity; I am responding to it. I am acting, in other words, universally, and none of the social problems that afflict us will be solved unless we recover the universalist standpoint that sees beyond the visible divisions, and is not trapped in, or enraptured by, the specificities of our tribes. Pluralism secures the right to turn inward, but it also broaches the duty to turn outward. By surrounding us with other partialities it legitimates our own partiality, but it also reveals that there is more to the world than what is merely ours.</p>
<p>A great deal has been written in recent years about the discovery of our commonplace biases and the techniques for overcoming them. Much of this literature is psychological, but …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time datetime="2020-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">December 30, 2020</time></p><p>For a few months, I’ve been collaborating on the
<a href="https://inet.af/netaddr"><code>inet.af/netaddr</code></a> package for Go which introduces a
new <code>netaddr.IP</code> type as an alternative to the standard library’s
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#IP"><code>net.IP</code></a> type. There are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/inet.af/netaddr#readme-motivation">a variety of reasons
for this</a>, but those are
not the focus of today’s blog.</p><p>The folks over at <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> have been working on
improving the performance of the package in various ways, including shrinking
the size of types and trying out faster internal IP representations.
Specifically, one topic that came up was <a href="https://github.com/inetaf/netaddr/pull/57">how to shrink <code>netaddr.IP</code> from 32
bytes to 24 bytes</a>, the same size
as a Go slice header.</p><p>Because a <code>netaddr.IP</code> can also have an associated zone for IPv6 link-local
addresses, the type previously contained a Go string, which occupies 16 bytes.
This is a good use case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">string
interning</a>, a technique which
can be used to reduce the number of string allocations. It is highly likely that
a small number of zone identifiers will be used repeatedly throughout a program,
so string interning seems like a great fit for this problem.</p><p>In addition, another need for <code>netaddr.IP</code> is to guarantee that identical input
strings will also have identical backing data pointers in the intern pool. This
ensures that the input strings are usable internally as map keys, can occupy
less space in the pool, and can be used to occupy only one word of memory within
the type rather than two, as a Go string header would.</p><p>The result of this work is the package
<a href="https://go4.org/intern"><code>go4.org/intern</code></a> which uses some pretty neat <code>unsafe</code>
tricks to implement efficient string interning using weak references and Go
finalizers. We’ll start by showing off the safe implementation and gradually
introduce the concepts needed to understand the unsafe one as well.</p><p>All credit for the ideas and implementation of <code>go4.org/intern</code> goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave
Anderson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/commaok">Josh Bleecher
Snyder</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a>. I simply watched the discussions
unfold on the issue tracker and thought that the code and the ideas behind it
were too interesting to not write up and share!</p><h2 id="safe-string-interning-in-go">Safe string interning in Go</h2><p>The basic idea of string interning is to retain a global pool of strings which
can be created or fetched on the fly, so that each string is allocated exactly
once for values which are identical. It’s worth noting that since our code will
accept empty <code>interface{}</code>, you could use it with any type which can be used as
a map key. This blog will focus on strings, but the same API could be used for
comparing the equality of a large struct type as well.</p><p>In its most basic form, you could implement <code>go4.org/intern</code> (with a caveat!) by
writing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

<span>// A Value pointer is the handle to an underlying comparable value.
</span><span>// See func Get for how Value pointers may be used.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Value <span>struct</span> {
	<span>// Enforce that Values cannot be used directly for equality comparisons.
</span><span></span>	<span>// We'll explain why a bit later.
</span><span></span>	_      [0]<span>func</span>()
	cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}
}

<span>// Get returns the comparable value passed to the Get func
</span><span>// that returned v.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> (v *Value) Get() <span>interface</span>{} { <span>return</span> v.cmpVal }

<span>// Our pool of interned values and a lock to serialize access.
</span><span></span><span>var</span> (
	mu      sync.Mutex
	val = <span>map</span>[<span>interface</span>{}]*Value{}
)

<span>// Get returns a pointer representing the comparable value cmpVal.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// The returned pointer will be the same for Get(v) and Get(v2)
</span><span>// if and only if v == v2, and can be used as a map key.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// Note that Get returns a *Value so we only return one word of data
</span><span>// to the caller, despite potentially storing a large amount of data
</span><span>// within the Value itself.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> Get(cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}) *Value {
	mu.Lock()
	<span>defer</span> mu.Unlock()

	v := val[cmpVal]
	<span>if</span> v != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Value is already interned in the pool.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> v
	}

	<span>// Value must be created now and then interned.
</span><span></span>	v = &amp;Value{cmpVal: cmpVal}
	val[cmpVal] = v
	<span>return</span> v
}</code></pre></div><p>Usage of the package is straightforward at this point:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> TestBasics(t *testing.T) {
	foo := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)
	foo2 := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)

	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != foo2.Get() {
		t.Error(<span>"foo values differ"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != <span>"foo"</span> {
		t.Error(<span>"foo.Get not foo"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo != foo2 {
		t.Error(<span>"foo pointers differ"</span>)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The global pool in the library stored the string <code>"foo"</code> on the first call to
<code>intern.Get("foo")</code> and the same <code>*intern.Value</code> was returned and stored in both
<code>foo</code> and <code>foo2</code>.</p><p>However there is a caveat to this approach: the pool can never shrink. If we
keep adding more distinct values to the pool, it will continue to grow in size
and allocate more memory until our program eventually runs out of memory and
crashes. Even if we don’t add more values, we’ve still stranded some of our
memory for the entire duration of the program’s execution.</p><p>In fact, this is the tradeoff made by <code>go4.org/intern</code> for the “safe” operating
mode of the package. If you run your program with the environment variable
<code>GO4_INTERN_SAFE_BUT_LEAKY=true</code> then no unsafe tricks will be used, and the
intern pool will continue to grow as more items are added. For some programs,
this may be an acceptable tradeoff, but there’s much more to be discussed!</p><h2 id="breaking-the-unsafe-rules">Breaking the unsafe rules</h2><p>In order to make use of string interning while also cooperating with Go’s
garbage collector to remove and free unused values from the pool, it is
necessary to bend the package <code>unsafe</code> rules. This is what inspired me to author
this blog: I’ve written a lot of unsafe code in the past but have never
intentionally stepped outside the guard rails that the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer"><code>unsafe.Pointer</code> rules
provide for you</a>.</p><p>Specifically, we have to violate rule number 3:</p><blockquote><p>(3) Conversion of a Pointer to a uintptr and back, with arithmetic.</p><p>… Note that both [uintptr and unsafe.Pointer] conversions must appear in the
same expression, with only the intervening arithmetic between them:</p></blockquote><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// INVALID: uintptr cannot be stored in variable
</span><span>// before conversion back to Pointer.
</span><span></span>u := uintptr(p)
p = unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code></pre></div><p>In a hypothetical future version of Go, it is possible that the value stored at
the address pointed at by the <code>p</code> in the Go heap could be moved in between the
conversion and assignment <code>u := uintptr(p)</code> and the pointer arithmetic <code>p =
unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code>.</p><p>Because we are relying on the invariant that the Go garbage collector (as of Go
1.15) does not move data in the heap, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a> came up with a clever pseudo-package
which users can underscore import if they intend to violate this particular
package <code>unsafe</code> rule:
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc"><code>go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc</code></a>.
If a program or its dependencies import this package and a future version of Go
uses a moving garbage collector which may rearrange items in the heap, the
package can be updated to fail compilation when the program’s behavior is now
invalid.</p><p>Technically, Go <em>does</em> have a moving garbage collector for its stacks as of Go
1.15. See <a href="https://github.com/go4org/unsafe-assume-no-moving-gc/issues/3">Matthew Dempsky’s issue for more
details</a>. Because
<code>go4.org/intern</code> stores values in a global map, the values will never be stack
allocated and thus this is not a problem for this particular use case.</p><p>Now that we’ve set the terms of engagement, it’s time to dive in to the unsafe
implementation.</p><h2 id="unsafe-string-interning-in-go">Unsafe string interning in Go</h2><p>We’ll be implementing the package <code>intern</code> code with the same API as before, but
with our newfound <code>unsafe</code> tricks and some <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">Go runtime
finalizers</a> as well.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

down <code>Get</code> and <code>finalize</code> specifically to discuss how these interact with each
other and the Go runtime.</p><p>Starting with <code>Get</code>, we acquire the mutex around the map of interned values,
which now stores the values as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_reference">weak references using
<code>uintptr</code></a> rather than a concrete
<code>*Value</code> type. This ensures that the values are not protected from garbage
collection, and thus we must manually manage their lifecycles by using</p></div></div></div>

But I’m really excited, because I just got the Tetris title screen working!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9JwbvM5phtNcpgBj_2Un5C3QWVLTn24SWN43trTYG7ryH4enLNU6vbMzqMYwridlrhT8HswNBQNVUk19vTe87fsSwvJf0W-IsUEx6j8u13I1zKrktnzabBUzOf3lZcNor0lvGxV" title=""></span></p><p><span>This is the first time I’ve worked on an emulator and </span><span>oh boy</span><span>&nbsp;do I regret taking this long to get around to it. This has been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Not only do I feel like I’m truly gaining a more fundamental understanding of the internals of a machine (which is sort of the point), but it is SO exciting suddenly seeing someone else’s software pop up on the screen.</span></p><p><span>I’m still working on this journey myself but I thought I’d share what I’ve done so far to hopefully encourage others to give this a go.</span></p><p><span>It all started with the bootrom. The gameboy didn’t have an operating system. It simply had a simple bootrom that showed you that famous Nintendo logo (which is actually </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA">a novel DRM scheme</a></span><span>). It’s a very simple program that you can read line by line making it pretty easy to work out where I was going wrong. I started by making a “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></span><span>” which was just a big ol switch statement going through </span><span><a href="https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/">each opcode</a></span><span>. This is definitely the most labour intensive part of the project. There are a lot of opcodes.</span></p><p><span>What you quickly discover while implementing opcodes is that the gameboy memory is basically just an array. So next I created registers and an “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a></span><span>” (the gameboy didn’t really have an MMU but this made things easier to manage). After around four days, I had the Nintendo logo rendering!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xRho4Dq1Fo1vUdM6BNTShSDwfBupG_CSlcrlkG2m9MhC_O75h1T1krLYA16RbOXUSH0BO-W_6u-2B6opnDkgzO3BYHmHJLxgrWbaPEJfbhumMPHAZp0acPT2iL_86tIv3zCLl6DB" title=""></span></p><p><span>Simple rendering is pretty straightforward. The Gameboy would write to a certain region of memory reserved for video so all you need to do is read from there to know what you should render. Once I got that far - I was completely hooked. My approach of just implementing more and more Gameboy hardware was working.</span></p><p><span>There are already a ton of resources that go into far more detail:</span></p><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html">http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU">http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/">https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/</a></span></li></ul><p><span>If you have the time and you’re interested, I would strongly suggest you give this project a go.

<div id="post-body"><p>I have recently bought an e-book by a <a href="https://gumroad.com/dellannaluca">Gumroad author</a> named <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca">Luca Dellana</a>. I have to admit I did it mainly to see how successful authors on Gumroad package their offerings. I was initially skeptical about the book, dismissing it as just another attempt to capitalize on the self-help trend. As I kept reading, however, I found a few clever references washing away my initial skepticism. One quote in particular, stuck in my mind, and I cannot seem to stop thinking about it: </p><blockquote>"If you think about it, the very important never feels urgent. Instead, <strong>most things which feel urgent are important <em>for someone else</em>, not for you."</strong></blockquote><p>Something so simple and yet so difficult to put through common sense. Modern life is full of urgency - from the moment we wake up to the time we go back to bed. Things coming from different directions, fighting for our undivided attention, non-stop.</p><p>The key is this. We acknowledge the presence of <strong>urgency</strong>, however, most of us wrongly attribute <strong>importance</strong> to it, putting the actually important stuff aside. In reality, things that matter usually become urgent when it is too late. In most other times, they are important for someone else, not for us.</p><p>Think about that project at work that so badly needed to be finished before the holidays. It must have brought a ton of pressure to you and your team, hasn't it? Yet, chances are, you would hardly remember it on your deathbed. Neither will your boss or their boss, either. The only person for whom it makes any difference is the one who created the business. If that is not you, I have news - you need to shift your focus. Start with your family and friends, for example. Or your health and passion. The kinds of things you always thought you would resort to doing someday, once you become rich and retired.</p><p>Do them now, instead of when it gets too late.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>«If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it will protect all of you.»<br>
<em>Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I like the quotation above. It’s a powerful statement and one of the reasons why I am not concerned when I hear positions I deeply detest. Well, as long as they are detested by society as well. Because if these people are heard, we just might have something similar to freedom of speech (we don’t have that first amendment in Germany).</p>
<p>But, damn, it’s not easy to listen to positions you don’t like.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of that issue when I tried to listen to a “<a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast/culture-wars-with-andrew-doyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Wars with Andrew Doyle</a>” episode, <a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast-episode/the-misogyny-of-trans-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in which he had Julie Bindel as a guest</a>. She’s a feminist, lesbian, and judging by what I have heard of her, does not like men very much. It’s all patriarchy, men &amp; violence, the whole narrative. At least that how that episode appeared to me.</p>
<p>And after less than half of the episode, I had enough.</p>
<p>I might agree with (part of) her criticism of trans-activists, but the way she talks about men — damn, she appeared to have been stuck in the past. Or rather, in an extremely antiquated view of men. It’s strange how in many other areas we talk about the overlap between men and women being greater than the differences (not in physical strength, but you get the idea), but when it comes to power somehow we are talking about two distinct populations.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>That stick-in-the-mud perspective lost its appeal years ago. Just look at the number of homeless, suicides (actual, not attempts), murders, and much, much more. And sure, when it comes to murder, most of the murderers might me male, but would you really care about the sex of the murderer when you get murdered? I wouldn’t. I found her attitude appalling. And I am — again — very glad I am not a woman. If I had people like her ostensibly speak for me … I’d be mad as hell. Like when it comes to what makes a woman, or whether sex work is demeaning. Seriously? Why not let each person decide for <em>themselves</em> what the fuck that means and how they see that work?</p>
<p>I thought people — and that includes women — should decide for themselves?</p>
<p>And yeah, on another level, it was really funny (for a part of me) to hear that all those <em>unfair</em> strategies, all this emotional reasoning feminists used against men (and women who disagreed), is now used by trans-activists against feminists.</p>
<p>You’ve made your bed, you’ve used those strategies, now how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>But yeah, I take no pleasure in watching the world burn. So no, I don’t really take pleasure from seeing those kind of feminists tasting their own medicine. But even so, I found her views so appalling that I stopped listening. Which I also found interesting. I thought of myself as someone who is willing to differing perspectives, but I guess I found my limits.</p>
<p>And that is actually something valuable I will take from this “conversation”, well listening to that podcast: Nobody listens to you if you disparage their person, no matter how much they might agree with your point.</p>
<p>So, it was <em>surprisingly educating</em>.</p>

December 30, 2020 | https://www.coryzue.com/writing/2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.coryzue.com/writing/2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p><em>This is the fourth installment of my “year in review” series. 
For a recap, here’s <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-years/">2018</a> 
and <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/the-year-everything-changed/">2017</a>.</em></p>

<p>2020 was my fourth year of building my own internet businesses.
Like everyone else, my 2020 did <em>not</em> go according to plan.
And yet, things worked out in the end.</p>

<p>It was a year of big swings: starting with a taste of celebrity—followed by 
the collapse of my biggest business—and closing with record-breaking success.
Eventually I ended up almost exactly where I planned,
only the route was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of my 2020 in nine pictures.</p>

<h4 id="january-officially-an-indie-hacker">January: officially an Indie Hacker!</h4>

<p>In January, I met and recorded a podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>,
founder of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and a hero of mine. 
When <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/147-cory-zue-of-place-card-me">the podcast aired</a>,
I had a tiny taste of celebrity, hearing from people throughout the Twitter-verse
who were inspired by my story.
It was the most fun moment of my Indie Hacking career.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/first-subscription/me-and-courtland.jpg" alt="Meeting Courtland Allen"></p>

<p>Me and Courtland Allen in his Cape Town Airbnb. January, 2020.</p>

<p>Courtland also convinced me to double down on my <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">wedding place card app</a>—called Place Card Me—leading
to <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/first-subscription/">my first ever subscription revenue online</a>.</p>

<p>The year was looking good!</p>

<h4 id="march-the-pandemic-shakes-things-up">March: the pandemic shakes things up</h4>

<p>Fast forward to mid-March, and the world decided to take Covid-19 very seriously, very fast.</p>

<p>Place Card Me—my primary side-business—saw its revenue plummet to $0 almost overnight.
Not seeing a way to pivot, I decided to pause work on the project indefinitely—now
9 months and counting—and shift my focus to <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Pegasus, my Django boilerplate for SaaS apps</a>.
Sorry, Courtland!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/place-card-me-5-weeks-corona.png" alt="Place Card Me Revenue Feb-March"></p>

<p>Place Card Me’s revenue, late Feb - April 1. It has sinced picked up a bit, but remains
well off 2019’s numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Africa—where I live—introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world,
including banning alcohol sales and disallowing outdoor exercise.
I had to resort to running in circles around my flat.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/lockdown-run.png" alt="Lockdown Run"></p>

<p>My lockdown running route. Hundreds of circles around my small flat. March, 2020.</p>

<p>The lockdown also took away our childcare, so my wife and I split the work day in half.
My productive hours ended at noon, most of my time went to my day job,
and my side-businesses languished.</p>

<h4 id="may-my-first-record-breaking-month-of-the-year">May: my first record-breaking month of the year</h4>

<p>In May we got childcare back and for the first time in months I had time for proactive work.</p>

<p>I started by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/may-2020/">experimenting with some pricing changes</a> 
leading to Pegasus earning over $4,000—more than any of my products had ever earned in a single month.
I had to re-do the axes on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open">side-project dashboard</a>—where I track
my product revenue and effort—to accommodate the new high.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/pegasus-y-axis.png" alt="Pegasus Breaking the Chart"></p>

<p>Pegasus income breaks the chart on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side project dashboard</a>. May, 2020.</p>

<h4 id="july-august-distractions-and-failure">July-August: distractions and failure</h4>

<p>July and August saw my biggest divergence of the year.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be a good opportunity to exercise Pegasus, I decided to build and launch
a new product to provide <a href="https://repostory.app/">code review analytics for Github repositories</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before I finished MVP I realized the project was too ambitious for the 
amount of time I was willing to devote to it.
So, following a lackluster launch, and seeing a long road ahead, 
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/aug-2020/">I decided to stop working on it indefinitely</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/repostory-social.png" alt="RepoStory"></p>

<p>RepoStory: my failed experiment building code review analytics product, launched to no one in August.</p>

<p>I still think the project has potential, but for now it’s lying idle.</p>

<h4 id="september-hello-world">September: hello world!</h4>

<p>September marked the arrival of our new son Victor into the world.
I learned that <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/new-parent-again/">being a parent is easier the second time around</a>—except
for the <em>other</em> kid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/new-parent-again/victor-sleep.jpg" alt="Hello Victor"></p>

<p>Our new son Victor, born September 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on paternity leave I stumbled upon a diagram labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">Ikigai</a>—that 
I later learned was <em>not</em> Ikigai—that made me question about my chosen career.</p>

<p>Specifically, I felt like I was doing well with everything <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/ikigai/">except possibly “what the world needs”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/not-ikigai.jpg" alt="Not Ikigai"></p>

<p>This diagram, often attributed as the Japanese concept of Ikigai, was actually
created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmograma">Andrés Zuzunaga</a>.</p>

<p>So, I devoted a chunk of the last three months of the year to trying to explore the topic of a “meaningful” life
and career more seriously.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/how-to-save-the-world/">turns out this is hard</a>!</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I figure it out.</p>

<h4 id="november-another-record-breaking-month">November: another record-breaking month</h4>

<p>Back on the business-side of things, at the end of November, I ran an impulse Black Friday sale,
leading to another record-breaking month for Pegasus and 
me—outstripping my previous monthly high by almost $3,000.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/total-profits-social.png" alt="Black Friday"></p>

<p>The massive spike from the Pegasus Black Friday sale. November, 2020.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">my write-up on the sale</a> made 
the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, resulting in about 10,000
visitors to my website and leading to another few Pegasus sales.</p>

<p>After the whole saga, I was suddenly within reach of my 2020 profit target of $42k that
I’d all-but abandoned post-Covid.</p>

<h4 id="december-rr">December: R&amp;R</h4>

<p>Finally, rounding out the year amidst another Covid surge and lockdown in South Africa
with the family and some time off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/family-holidays.jpg" alt="Family Holidays"></p>

<p>While alcohol sales are again closed in South Africa, at least the national parks are open. December, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="profits">Profits</h2>

<p>When all was said and done, <strong>total profits on the year from personal projects came in just over $43,000</strong>—or
about $1k higher than <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">my goal set in January</a>.
Given how hard the pandemic hit Place Card Me, I’m quite proud to have still hit that target.</p>

<p>Here’s the last four years of product income—broken out by product.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/profits-by-year.png" alt="Profits by year"></p>

<p>Annual profits by product. Now available on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side-project dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Place Card Me ended up down about 42% on the year, but Pegasus more than made up for it,
growing from $4,000 to almost $30,000 in a single year—or about <em>double</em> 
what I had forecasted at the start of the year.</p>

<p>More on this later.</p>

<h2 id="time-spend">Time spend</h2>

<p>I logged just under 2,000 hours this year. 
This works out almost exactly to a standard 40-hour-a-week, 52-week work-year,
which makes it easier to think about the time distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/2020-time.png" alt="2020 time"></p>

<p>In terms of a calendar year breakdown, about four months went to my day job at Dimagi,
three months went to Pegasus, six weeks went to email and writing,
another five weeks went to exercise(!), and then the rest fell into smaller buckets.</p>

<p>I’m happy with this breakdown, though I would prefer if the amount of “day job” time was a bit
less and the amount of “exploration” time was a bit more.
Something to think about for 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>If 2020 was the year of Pegasus then 2021 will be the year of…well…also Pegasus.</p>

<p>Yep, for the third year running, <strong>I’m planning for Pegasus to be my main hustle</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><em>Because it still feels like Pegasus is in its first act</em>.</p>

<p>A year into Place Card Me the product felt basically complete.
I could add features, improve marketing, etc. but there weren’t any easy ways to grow it without 
fundamentally changing the product in some way.
Place Card Me made place cards well. Where do you go from there?</p>

<p>Pegasus on the other hand, seems to have limitless possibility.
The core product itself can continue getting better, with lots of features to add and improvements to 
make—some of which are already in flight. Plus, it’s fun as hell.</p>

<p>But even Pegasus itself is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Could Pegasus have a plug-in marketplace where other developers can earn money extending it?
Could Pegasus have a jobs board to connect Django developers to my customers who need help on their projects?
Could Pegasus offer Django courses or books?
Or a hosted way to deploy your Django apps to the cloud?</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/183-chris-oliver-of-gorails">Chris Oliver has done for Ruby on Rails</a>, 
there appear to be an infinite amount of Pegasus-adjacent opportunities to create new products, offerings,
and build out the Pegasus ecosystem—all of which are aligned with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah. Already my most profitable product by a lot and still in act one.
Hopefully exciting times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="2021-targets">2021 Targets</h2>

<p>The other big decision I’ve made about 2021 is that it’s time to flip the narrative 
of what I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>For the last four years I’ve thought of myself as a professional developer/freelancer who also played around
on the internet trying to make money from side-hustles.</p>

<p>But barring an unexpected turn of events—<em>I expect 2021 to be the first year I make
the majority of my income from my own businesses</em>.
A change I hope just might hold for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>the side hustles have become the main hustle.</em>
<strong>I’m no longer a <em>side-project</em> entrepreneur. I’m a mother-fucking <em>real entrepreneur</em>.</strong></p>

<p>So, here are my targets for 2020:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Earn $65k Profit from personal projects.</li>
  <li>Spend the majority of my time working for myself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to own this thing!
I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Random forests are great as baseline models, better than GBDTs like xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost.</li>
  <li>The other side of the coin: don’t expect a lot of improvement from tuning random forests.</li>
  <li>When tuning hyperparameters, choose at least one to explore bagging, one to explore subspace sampling, and one (preferably two) to control model complexity.</li>
  <li>Most papers on this have flaws. This essay is an interim report on the <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles">WIP benchmark</a> we are doing.</li>
</ul>



<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01914">A Comparative Analysis of XGBoost</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, the authors analyzed the gains from doing hyperparameter tuning on 28 datasets (classification tasks). scikit-learn’s RandomForestClassifier, with default hyperparameter values,</p>
<ul>
  <li>did better than xgboost models (default hyperparameter values) in 17/28 datasets (61%)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, and</li>
  <li>did better than tuned xgboost models (trained on 3840 hyperparameter configurations) in 9/28 datasets (32%)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Random forests are great baseline models - it’s hard to train a poorly performing random forest. With xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost, you not only have to tune more hyperparameters to get good results, but you also have to tune the number of trees in the ensemble, adding a lot of runtime to your experiments (you barely have to tune the number of trees in a random forest). There is a reason why random forests are more popular than more-advanced GBDT and variants (as implemented in xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So while GBDTs are great for kaggle competitions, random forests are an integral part of the practising data scientist’s toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-essay">
Why this essay?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random forests have a reputation for not being very tunable: while the default values of hyperparameters will often produce a good enough random forest, on the downside tuning a lot of parameters does not produce a lot of improvements in model performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The typical implementation of random forests has too many parameters for us to tune all of them together, and the gain from doing so is not expected to be significant anyway. In the wild, we see all sorts of subsets of the hyperparameters being tuned, without much empirical sense behind it.</p>

<p>We haven’t found any concise overview of best practices for tuning hyperparameters for random forests, so we wrote one. If you know of such a guide, please let us know <a href="https://twitter.com/dataBiryani">@dataBiryani</a>. Besides, we wanted to run our own experiments to validate the papers we read. Some of those experiments are included in the accompanying repo<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>



<p>Before jumping into details, we’ll put some structure into how we think about the hyperparameters found in random forest implementations. Those hyperparameters typically relate to one of the following aspects of training an RF:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrapping (bagging)</li>
  <li>Subspace sampling</li>
  <li>Base-model complexity and regularization</li>
</ul>

<p>To understand where this comes from, let’s quickly review how random forests are constructed.</p>

<h2 id="how-random-forests-work">
How random forests work</h2>

<p>Random forests are collections of independently-constructed decision trees. Here is how we construct those individual trees:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a <strong>bootstrapped</strong> sample: We create a subset of all available observations by repeatedly sampling one observation at a time, typically with replacement.</li>
  <li>Train the decision tree
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>subspace sampling</strong> at every node: Every time we need to split a node in the decision tree, we consider only a subset of the features (subspace sample) from the bootstrapped sample (instead of all features).</li>
      <li>control <strong>Base-model complexity</strong> and prevent overfitting with <strong>regularization</strong>: To maximize the ensemble performance, we must make the right choice in bias/variance trade-off. Decision trees offer a lot of hyperparameters to control the bias/variance trade-off by manipulating the complexity and size of the base learners generated. Bootstrapping and subspace sampling parameters contribute to this as well, but we consider them separately. Also, most hyperparameters manipulating base-model complexity have some amount of regularisation effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aggregate the trees: For a given observation, we create an ensemble prediction by taking the predictions from individual trees and taking the mode (classification) or averaging the values (regression). The earlier bootstrapping, followed by this aggregating, is called <strong>bagging</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hyperparameters-of-random-forest">
Hyperparameters of random forest</h2>

<p>In this essay, we’ll look at the implementation of random forests in sklearn (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html">RandomForestClassifier</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html">RandomForestRegressor</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/random-forests-hyperparameters.png" alt=""></p>



<p>We propose that instead of tuning a mish-mash of hyperparameters, we tune some hyperparameters from each of the groups we listed above: Bootstrapping (bagging), Subspace sampling, and Base-model complexity/regularization.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we go a little deeper into how we should choose hyperparameters from each of those three groups.</p>

<h2 id="the-experiment">
The experiment</h2>

<p>We looked at a few research papers to find meta-experiments around hyperparameter tuning of random forests. However, we came up short because of a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The tuning is done only for small datasets, which we felt was not representative of the kind of models that are trained in practice today.</li>
  <li>It was hard to reproduce the experiments. Some involved hard-to-obtain datasets, and in some cases a few datasets have been lost.</li>
  <li>We wanted to look deeper into the model tuning - not only the score and hyperparameter-configuration of the top model but of a few more models at the top.</li>
  <li>We believed better tuning was needed to draw fairer conclusions. Sometimes not the right subsets were tuned, sometimes not enough tuning was done (too few configurations), and sometimes the values chosen were rather extreme for the given datasets!</li>
</ol>

<p>So we started our own benchmarking exercise, the code and output of which is available at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/tree/main/random_forest/">https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/tree/main/random_forest/</a>. It is still a work in progress. We started with the smallest datasets in the <a href="https://docs.openml.org/benchmark/#openml-cc18">openml-cc18 benchmark</a><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and so far have added 41 datasets to our benchmark. More details can be found in the repo.</p>

<p>The summary of the dataset and the results is <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/openml_experiments.csv">available here</a><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrappingbagging">
Bootstrapping/Bagging</h2>

<h3 id="n_estimators">
n_estimators</h3>

<p>While <code>n_estimators</code>, the number of trees in the ensemble, is critical to the success of the random forest, it is also the easiest to tune - simply set it to a large enough number.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324">Random forests</a><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> paper, Breiman proved that generalization errors for classification and regression random forests converge as the number of trees grows. Moreover, in the paper <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/17-269/17-269.pdf">To tune or note to tune the number of trees in random forest</a><sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>, the authors provide theoretical and empirical validity to the monotonicity of the performance measure curve for a combination of tasks and performance metrics (e.g., logloss for classification). It follows that the measure will keep improving as we increase the number of trees, eventually leveling off.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of smallish datasets for specific combinations of tasks and performance metrics (e.g., AUC for classification), they find that the monotonicity doesn’t hold, and very specific non-monotonous patterns are exhibited (as can be seen below).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/random_forest_number_of_trees_non_monotonous.png" alt="" title="From 'To tune or not to tune the number of trees in random forest?'"></p>

<p>In these cases (about 10% of the datasets they analyzed), the error rate curves, after reaching their lowest values, gradually rise again as the number of trees grows, eventually to converge at a value very slightly higher than the lowest value achieved before. Quoting from the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the curve grows again after reaching its lowest value, leading to a value at 2000 trees that is by at least 0.005 bigger than the lowest value of the OOB error rate curve for $T \in [10, 150]$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using math and empirical analysis, they describe the kind of small datasets exhibiting this behaviour, where chasing this kind of minuscule improvement in model performance is perhaps not very meaningful given the associated computational costs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In practice, we should set <code>n_estimators</code> to a computationally feasible large number and not spend time tuning it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/high_mfeat-factors.png" alt="" title="The dataset 'mfeat-factors' has the highest number of datapoints (#samples x #features) among the 41 datasets in the benchmark. This is the parallel coordinates plot depicting top 5 models from the 500 RF models on the dataset using RandomSearchCV."></p>

<p>The parallel coordinates plot above shows the top 5 models from the 500 trained on the ‘mfeat-factors’ dataset that has the highest number of datapoints (#samples x #features) among the 41 datasets in the benchmark. As we can see, there is a model with just 100 trees almost matching the top-performing model. The story remains the same when we consider other datasets with high (<a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_electricity.png">electricity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_optdigits.png">optdigits</a>) or low (<a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_balance-scale.png">balance-scale</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_ilpd.png">ilpd</a>) number of data points.</p>

<h3 id="bootstrap">
bootstrap</h3>

<p>If bootstrap is <code>False</code>, the whole dataset is used to build the trees (no bagging), significantly taking away our ability to make an effective bias-variance trade-off. We almost never have to tune this.</p>

<h3 id="max_samples">
max_samples</h3>

<p>With <code>n_estimators</code> and <code>bootstrap</code> not providing many opportunities for tuning, <code>max_samples</code> (default value of 1.0) is the only hyperparameter left that we can use to tune bagging. We again turn to parallel coordinate plots for some empirical guidance.</p>

<p>If we look at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_electricity.png">electricity</a>, high values of <code>max_samples</code> seem to be effective (all hyperparameters seem to be in a stable region as well). This is not a lot of value-add though, as the default value is 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/high_electricity.png" alt="" title="parallel coordinate plots for 'electricity'"></p>

<p>On the other hand, if we look at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_balance-scale.png">balance-scale</a>, low values of <code>max_samples</code> seem to be effective. Tuning the parameter here was very valuable, as most of the top models have low values of <code>max_samples</code> (far from the default value of 1).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/low_balance-scale.png" alt="" title="parallel coordinate plots for 'balance-scale'"></p>

<p>You can look at the other plots we linked to above, or play with any of the datasets using <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/hiplot.ipynb">the notebook in the repo</a> to see that it makes sense to tune <code>max_samples</code> well.</p>

<p>If computational power is not a bottleneck, you can simply tune it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

	<div>
		<p>Societies have long valued information control but methods of control have changed over time. What systems drive these changes? And where do undesirable outcomes occur?</p>
<p>Using any of these methods doesn’t imply bad intentions. In some cases, there are good reasons for wanting to control information. But if we’re thinking only of intentions, we’ll lose our focus on outcomes. <strong><a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/morals-of-the-moment/">Good intentions</a> can lead us down bad pathways</strong>.</p>
<p>Four major types of control information are destruction, banning, debauching, and blocking.</p>
<p>These methods are applied to recorded information as well as what we carry in our memories and pass down verbally.</p>
<p>And why do I care about this?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png" alt="" width="550" height="271" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png 876w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-300x148.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><span id="more-2793"></span></p>
<h2>Destroy</h2>
<p>When we think of the topic of information control, we might naturally think of destruction. But <strong>destruction is a small part</strong> of this issue today.</p>
<p>Many of the best examples of destruction are from long ago.</p>
<p>China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, ordered the burning of books (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars">213 BC</a>) that existed before his reign so that he could not be compared with times of the past. As the Qin emperor’s chancellor is recorded as saying: <em>“Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed.”</em> The Qin emperor did however allow books on certain topics to survive, including&nbsp; agriculture and medicine.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a> (the erasure of specific villains from history) served both as punishment and to prevent others from committing similar acts.</p>
<p>Note that destroying information was more possible in the past. When much information was handwritten, not easily replicable or distributed, and in limited quantities, outright destruction was a serious option. Destruction became less of an option after the development of the printing press, online distribution and historical backups, and more.</p>
<h2>Ban</h2>
<p><strong>Banning often comes from a entity’s decision that certain information is contrary to their aims</strong>. Information may be banned because it is bad for morals, is believed to create bad feelings, may harm the people who should be protected from it, or may harm the group banning it.</p>
<p>Books form some of the better known types of banned content. There are too many banned books to list.</p>
<p>Germany in the leadup to WWII started to burn and ban books and other works of art, building a “list of harmful and undesirable literature” with <a href="https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/berlin-im-nationalsozialismus/verbannte-buecher/#headline_1_2">4,500 works</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the more famous books banned at one time in the US (with their reasons) include: <em>Brave New World</em> (sex, drugs, morals), <em>Animal Farm</em> (politics on multiple sides), <em>Catch-22</em> (profanity), <em>Of Mice and Men</em> (profanity, racial slurs), <em>Lord of the Flies</em> (morals, racism), <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> (sex, profanity, morals), <em>Invisible Man</em> (sex), <em>Satanic Verses</em> (blasphemy).</p>
<p>Bans also depend on timing. The Catholic Church (in an era of weakness due to the Protestant Reformation) banned Galileo’s works on the heliocentric solar system, but not Copernicus’ supporting work that predated it (in an era of a strong church).</p>
<p>In <em>The Republic </em>Plato even concerns himself in which types of music to ban. A dialogue in Book III outlines the types of music that should be allowed in an ideal city. Ban the dirges, ballads, and drinking songs; keep the marches.</p>
<p>A ban keeps information out, whether from a geographic area, an age group, a religious group, or political one. Bans don’t affect the existence of that information or its presence in other groups. <strong>The groups enforcing the ban are typically open about their reasons</strong>.</p>
<h2>Block</h2>
<p><strong>Groups understand the risk of allowing certain information to flow.</strong> Blocking is a more sophisticated version of banning. Where you might make a list of books that are to be banned, you never could do the same with the volume of user generated content created today.</p>
<p>Examples of blocking includes censorship during wartime. The lack of censorship in Spain (neutral during WWI) is why even today we refer the 1918 flu pandemic as the “Spanish Flu.” Spain was one of the few countries with reporting on the new disease.</p>
<p>Wartime censorship was also on an individual basis, scanning letters to prevent the flow of sensitive information. This exchange on WWII censorship from <em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! by </em>Richard Feynman shows how it sometimes worked:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Next day I get a letter from my wife that says, ‘It’s very difficult writing because I feel that the _____ is looking over my shoulder.’ And where the word was there is a splotch made with ink eradicator.<br>
“So I went down to the bureau, and I said, ‘You’re not supposed to touch the incoming mail if you don’t like it. You can look at it, but you’re not supposed to take anything out.’<br>
“They said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous. Do you think that’s the way censors work — with ink eradicator? They cut things out with scissors.’<br>
“I said OK. So I wrote a letter back to my wife and said, ‘Did you use ink eradicator in your letter?’ She writes back, ‘No, I didn’t use ink eradicator in my letter, it must have been the _____’ and there’s a hole cut out of the paper.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But today there are also subtler means of blocking, for example pushing information down to page two of Google, releasing information on a holiday when there will be a little attention or, as Youtube is now doing, blocking content related to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election">election fraud</a>.</p>
<p>The largest public version of this is China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a>, which blocks specific external sites and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Blocked information, when known, can also backfire. Those blocked Trump tweets related to the election may have caused more people to believe them than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-social-media-fact-check-farce-11606519380?mod=e2two">otherwise</a>.</p>
<p>Blocking can also be self-propagating. When people learn what information will be blocked, they may self-censor themselves both in posting about it and searching for it.</p>
<h2>Debauch</h2>
<p><strong>Information debauch sets out to change the information for a specific purpose.</strong> Perhaps in our modern belief in openness, this technique has become more common.</p>
<p>The purpose could be to harm a opponent, for example by exaggerating a quote taken out of context or preventing specific information from reaching an audience by altering it. I’ve written about <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">disinformation</a> variations of this.</p>
<p>There are different types of information debauch. One is the Cardinal Richelieu style of inventing a crime in anything (<em>“If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged”</em>). The other is to <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-clip/">select an out-of-context clip</a> of a longer conversation when it agrees with your worldview (unintentional debauch) or supports your argument (intentional debauch).</p>
<p>The intentional misrepresentation of quotes fascinates me. People can go back to the primary source to see that the misquote is actually misleading, but few actually do that.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this related to Trump, both from him and targeted against him. To choose one of the more bizarre examples, debauched information led many people to believe that Trump recommended injecting or drinking bleach to treat COVID <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/11/joe-biden/no-trump-didnt-tell-americans-infected-coronavirus/">when he didn’t</a> (the light mentioned was apparently <a href="https://aytubio.com/healight/">this</a>). Few people view the original video or quotes in their entirety rather than only the retold story. When something is odd but believable, people will pass it along.</p>
<p><strong>You should not want debauched information even if it helps your side.</strong> Information debauch can be used in any direction. Making it a norm hurts the entire system.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I’ve written about information and how we use it multiple times on this site, in <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/question-of-timing/">A Question of Timing</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/disinformation-and-disease-coronavirus-edition/">Disinformation and Disease</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">Prester John and the Long History of Disinformation</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">Acquiring Ignorance</a>, and other posts.</p>
<p>What unintended consequences can flow from each of these types of information control?</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroying: The loss of the information itself, historical value, missed links in human thought.</li>
<li>Banning: Possibly drawing more attention to the information than otherwise, bans can be found for contrary reasons.</li>
<li>Blocking: Does the controlling entity choose well?</li>
<li>Debauching: This technique brings doubt into other information, can be used in any direction, sows confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controlling the flow and accuracy of information has long been essential. We are just in a stage of the world where information can flow fast and far and yet still be controlled in ways described above.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been about a year since I published a post. From <a href="https://johanoakes.com/blog/12/03/2019/advent-day-1"><em>First Sunday of Advent</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll try to post a daily update; hopefully, a new generative piece everyday explaining the logic behind the engineering decisions and what I've learned. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hahahahaha. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abort,_Retry,_Fail%3F">Abort, Retry, Fail?</a> (<em>Don't be surprised to see this as a future blog post title</em> 👀). Anywho, you know what they say, don't publicize your goals. Hopefully, this upcoming year, I'll be more honest to myself, but in my defense, I have spent the year accruing a long list of potential blog ideas; the first idea being an elementary post-mortem analysis and presentation of how I debug memory exceptions in Java.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction permalink"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>My goal is to deliver a brief presentation of how I debug Java memory exceptions in my local environment. I am not going to scrutinize production-grade tools (e.g. <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/">YourKit Java Profiler</a>, New Relic, or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170">Java Flight Recorder</a>), though some tools may be used to fix production issues. Essentially, I want to provide some context around Java memory exceptions in terms of how I first encountered and had to debug a problem in my application, the routes explored and tools used to inspect and identify the memory exceptions, and suggestions for mitigating future issues. With any luck, the reader should get a glimpse and a curiosity for how memory works in Java and the tools available so that they'll be able to prevent memory exceptions or find and fix any memory leak errors that may occur.</p>

<h2 id="context"><a href="#context" aria-label="context permalink"></a>Context</h2>
<p>I won't go into the business purpose of the application, from here on out referred to as "KnowledgeDB", from which I had to debug memory exceptions due to legal reasons. Better safe than really, really sorry. However, KnowledgeDB is primarily a monolith backed by Spring Boot with a React frontend hosted on RHEL7 instances and supported by Kubernetes (<em>that was a mouthful</em>). Unfortunately, KnowledgeDB would come crashing down every couple months. Our team would wake up in the morning to a couple emails that our application's Spring Boot services were unresponsive. Luckily for us, our frontend was geared to display an error when data retrieval failed, so all our team had to do was restart the Kubernetes pod hosting our backend services. </p>
<p>To avoid further embarrasment and lost value, we wanted to make sure that we understood why our application's services crashed every two to three months. Without understanding the fundamental problem, memory usage stability is not guaranteed and the services will crash eventually.</p>

<p>Before I delve into KnowledgeDB's specific problem, it is worthwile to take a step back and produce a plan of attack. Listed below are a sequence of questions that may help when investigating a memory leak so that we're not shuffling around like headless chickens: </p>
<h3 id="questions-to-ask"><a href="#questions-to-ask" aria-label="questions to ask permalink"></a>Questions to Ask</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do I have a memory leak?</li>
<li>Which classes are leaking?</li>
<li>What is keeping these objects alive (an instance in the application)?</li>
<li>Where is it leaking from, or where in the code are these objects created and/or assigned? </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hunting-down-the-memory-leak"><a href="#hunting-down-the-memory-leak" aria-label="hunting down the memory leak permalink"></a>Hunting Down the Memory Leak</h3>
<p>After inspecting the logs, the stacktrace seemed standard: <em>Exception in thread &lt;thread_name&gt;: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, the error is thrown when there is insufficient space to allocate an object in the Java heap. In this case, the garbage collector (GC) cannot make space available to accommodate a new object, and the heap cannot be expanded further. <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our initial observations were clear: the exception occurred periodically, around two to three months, and the issue was NOT behavior driven (i.e. if users went to a certain web page or performed a certain operation, the application would halt and catch fire). KnowledgeDB seemed to work as expected until its breaking point. Since our application lived on Kubernetes pods that were not brought down, we hypothesized that our long-lived application may be unintentially holding references to objects which were unable to be garbage-collected, a memory leak. </p>
<p>From the initial observations, our team decided to run the application overnight and investigate the logs to spot irregularities. For example, was garbage collection being performed routinely? Additionally, we wanted to create a unit test(s), or use a load testing tool, to initiate an expensive operation with deterministic memory pressure. If the memory grew proportionally to the number of requests, then the memory leak should be fixable - we would just have to track where in our application code the objects were being created.</p>

<h3 id="visualvm-and-eclipse-mat"><a href="#visualvm-and-eclipse-mat" aria-label="visualvm and eclipse mat permalink"></a>VisualVM and Eclipse MAT</h3>
<p>Due to the relatively simple GUI and its integration with IntelliJ, VisualVM is the tool that I've used the most to inspect the performance and quality of my application code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Java VisualVM enables developers to generate and analyze heap dumps, track down memory leaks, perform and monitor garbage collection, and perform lightweight memory and CPU profiling. <sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, VisualVM does a lot to paint a simple picture of the application's performance. On top of it's fundamental abilties, VisualVM can be extended through plugins like Visual GC. Either way, it's a good idea to run VisualVM in the background during local development to have a sense of security that the application is performing as expected. </p>
<p>Anywho, it doesn't take much to get a basic view of your application's memory usage. First, VisualVM is generally found in your JDK's bin folder as <em>jvisualvm.exe</em>. If you're using JDK 9 or greater, you may need to download the executable through the application's <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/download.html">website</a>. After starting VisualVM, navigate to the <em>Monitor</em> tab for the appropriate application, and you should see, among a host of other metrics, a graph for memory. After running your application for a while, waiting until it gets to a "stable" state when all initialization is complete, and generating some object creation and deletion by interacting with your application, you should see the memory graph take the form of a sawtooth pattern like below: </p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/oakejp12/Graphics/blob/master/HuntingDownMemoryLeaks/good_visualvm.png?raw=true" alt="Healthy Memory Usage - VisualVM"></p>
<p>A sawtooth pattern usually denotes a healthy application. Over time, as objects are created through interaction with the application, the used heap will grow. At a certain point, garbage colleciton will kick in, and you'll see a steep drop of memory representing a shift of resources, or deletion of a alot unnessary objects. Please note that different applications render different memory graphs, but overall, you should NOT be seeing the used heap consume the total heap size.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, if you see something like the graph below then you may have stumbled unto a memory leak. There are indications of garbage collection by the small dips, but over time (or in this case, instantly), the used heap grows closer to the heap size. At some point, the heap will not be expanded further, and the garbage collector will not be able to make space available to accommodate a new object.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/oakejp12/Graphics/blob/master/HuntingDownMemoryLeaks/bad_visualvm.png?raw=true" alt="Unhealthy Memory Usage - VisualVM"></p>
<p>If you encounter a graph like the one above, you've answered your first question: do I have a memory leak? So what now? One more tool you can add to your belt is the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/mat/">Eclipse MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool)</a>. By generating a heap dump through Visual VM and loading the HPROF binary-formatted file to Eclipse MAT, you'll be able to investigate the heap, generate reports to check for leak suspects, and analyze objects for suspected memory issues. Tools like Eclipse MAT will be able to help you answer questions 2-4: which classes are leaking and where is it leaking from. </p>
<p>An alternative to generating heap dumps through Visual VM or another tool is to supply the <em>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</em> VM flag when starting your application. This will automatically create a heap dump file when you get an OutOfMemory error. I'll go more into VM arguments in Part II of this series.</p>
<h3 id="gc-logs"><a href="#gc-logs" aria-label="gc logs permalink"></a>gc-logs</h3>
<p>If you're opposed to running yet another GUI application in the background, you have the option to turn on verbose garbage collection logs for an application. By default, the GC log is written to <em>stdout</em>, but my recommendation is to provide a log file path and tail those logs while the application is running by using the following commands: <code>tail -f &lt;gc-log-file-path&gt;</code> in Unix or <code>Get-Content &lt;gc-log-file-path&gt; -Wait</code> in Powershell. GC logging can be enabled by passing the below VM arguments during application startup: </p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code>
-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:<span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span>


-Xlog:gc*:file<span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span>


-Xlog:gc*:file<span>=</span><span>\</span>"<span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span><span>\</span>"</code></pre></div>
<p>I've attached a GC log from a sample application exposing a soft memory leak below:</p>

<h2>Joy of Lisp.</h2>

<p>Ten years ago myself, Ray McDermott and Kristof Sajdak fell in love with functional programming; we marveled at its ease of expression, simplicity, and immutable data structures.</p>

<p>After reading the now classic <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf" title="[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, this only made functional programming more attractive.  It seemed to be what we had been missing in the typical enterprise landscape, which at that time, was full of Java and .Net. It was a literal <em>where have you been all my life</em> moment as the beauty of it struck a chord with all of us.</p>

<p>From there, we never looked back – with our eyes now wide open, we had seen the promise of the future, and the current languages just wouldn’t cut it any longer.  Outside of our world, other factors that contributed to functional languages’ perfect timing for emergence included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law was topping out</li>
<li>Lower cost multi-core CPUs were now mainstream</li>
<li>Parallel architectures were appearing, and</li>
<li>Jaded developers, were frustrated with their languages</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Odersky’s Scala programming language was the subject of significant press attention and turned many people like us onto the possibility of using functional programming for the enterprise, but it wasn’t quite right, it was’t a Lisp.</p>

<h2>Hello Clojure.</h2>

<pre><code>(ns hello-clojure.core)
(defn -main [&amp; args]
    (println "Hello, Clojure!"=))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Around this same period, Rich Hickey’s Clojure came to our attention, with the simplicity of Lisp, a REPL, immutability and, critically, first-class host language interop. With Interop, we were no longer in a walled garden that restricted so many other, purer implementations. Rich’s pragmatic choices and the resultant capabilities of Clojure ticked all the boxes. It also seemed to do the impossible: re-invigorating and exciting the development teams.</p>

<p>We started using Clojure where we could and where it proved viable.  Areas where we identified uses were primarily in applications where there was little or no existing code in place and no overriding requirement to adhere to a corporate standard. No going back now, we were all in.</p>

<h2>Enter ClojureScript.</h2>

<pre><code>
(ns todomvc.views
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]
            [re-frame.core :refer [subscribe dispatch]]
            [clojure.string :as str]))
</code>
</pre>

<p>ClojureScript goes everywhere; it can get to places that Clojure can’t go. It does this by piggybacking on the reach claim from JavaScript, and we can keep it functional.</p>

<p>We want our product to be able to reach any possible location, inside a car key fob, IoT devices, smart homes, and cities. ClojureScript is now mature enough to use everywhere, but it wasn’t always this way of course.</p>

<p>Looking back to 2010, I wanted to go way more mobile, and I had a desire to make the companies’ tech more ubiquitous for it to be deployed on iOS/Android/Tractors/Cars and we couldn’t do this in a functional programming way. Ray was using Clojure on Cloud PaaS and Web, continuing to leverage the JVM and Clojure to achieve great things.  Kristof and I worked on making connected cars “Restful” and idempotent, and JavaScript &amp; JSON made that happen for us; there just wasn’t a way to do this with functional programming.</p>

<p>As good as Clojure was we couldn’t use it where we wanted and felt like it was a vast chasm to cross for the reach that we desired to become a reality.</p>

<p>What we didn’t know then is that two future members of our team where actively solving this problem.</p>

<p>Mike Fikes built <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby" title="Goby" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goby</a>, a hybrid iOS app technology using ClojureScript and Objective-C and released it into the App Store. I understand that Facebook’s Lee Byron saw this, and it probably inspired Facebook towards going in this direction. Coincidently, David Nolen was asked by Facebook to speak at the React.JS conference around the same time. This led to both Mike and David being granted access to the React Native Github repository, which was closed to the public as it was still alpha.  Subsequently, Mike became the first person to get <a href="https://twitter.com/mfikes/status/573918846890938368?lang=en" title="ClojureScript working with React Native" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript working with React Native.</a></p>

<p>Separately &amp; together Mike and David worked on projects such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/" title="Om" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Om</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mfikes/ambly" title="Ambly" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ambly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/replete-repl/replete-ios" title="Replete" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replete</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/planck-repl/planck" title="Planck" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planck</a></li>
<li>and of course the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript" title="ClojureScript" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript</a> compiler itself</li>
</ul>

<p>They blazed a trail that we now take for granted.</p>

<p>We came into Vouch with a long-held belief of consuming technology where no competitive advantage was needed and where differentiation is not a critical factor; this allows us to move quickly without us needing to become experts in commodity technologies.</p>
<p>Therefore we stand on the shoulders of many industry giants. Examples of this would be <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel" title="Figwheel" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figwheel</a>, created by Bruce Hauman, which has revolutionized the way we build UI, and Blockchain, and provided a way to create absolute trust.  To make our platform work with these great technologies, we needed flexibility and modularity for our technology.</p>

<p>Our approach has always been to use the right tool for the right job, first and foremost, it just so happens that that has been ClojureScript.</p>

<h2>Attracting World-Class Talent.</h2>

<p>We started Vouch with a core team, myself, Ray and Kristof, who had worked together for many years before Vouch.  We quickly came to a point where we needed to expand the development team with skilled engineers who shared our vision and passion for building the company we wanted to create.</p>

<p>A company’s product vision, culture, and outcomes are not the only considerations for attracting world-class engineers to join a team; technology choices are just as critical, which has been one of my maxims for success over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Great people want to work on great teams using great technologies, to build great products.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While our team shares a common interest in Clojure/ClojureScript, more importantly, we all wanted to work within a great team, using great technologies, to build great products.</p>

<p>The team is growing and attracting seriously world-class talent faster than we can onboard them.  It might just be the best problem I have ever had to solve for. Recently Mike commented, <em>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could build a team that could make all the tools we wanted to use to develop our products?”,</em> I could not have agreed more.</p>

<h2>Community.</h2>

<p>The Vouch team began getting deeper into the  Clojure community by first attending and then speaking at conferences. Ray started to host the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a>  podcast, which led to an introduction and later joining of Mike Fikes to the Vouch team.  Mike then introduced David Nolen who subsequently joined the team.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is here to stay, loved by the team and obviously, we have David and Mike who are the lead committers of the language and compiler respectively.  Ray hosts the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/defn" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a> podcast and also started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UxEQuBvfLJgWR5tk_XIXA" title="Apropos" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apropos</a>. Our team speaks publicly and regularly at ClojureScript or related conferences. We invest in this language, we craft solutions using its strengths, we speak publicly about it, we educate people about it and most of all, we care for it.</p>

<h2>So are we actually betting the company on ClojureScript?</h2>

<p>In just 18 months with a small but highly skilled team, we have been able to conceive of, prototype, design, build and implement a breakthrough product that we believe will fundamentally alter the way that people, devices, software and processes interact digitally based on improving trust between those parties. I can honestly say that ClojureScript has been a substantial contributing factor to making this possible and in many ways, our product has become a poster child for the language.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is one of the most valuable tools available to us, and we use it where it makes sense to do so.  I’m not sure if we even consider this as a bet, but if it is, then it’s the safest bet we will ever make.</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>

<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

Therefore, the only sensible bet is to believe in God. This has come to be known as <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-pascals-wager-is-eminently-modern" target="_blank">Pascal’s wager</a>.</p><p>It has a surprising number of applications beyond concerns for a comfortable afterlife. There are many things for which the value of believing something or not can be seen as a cost-versus-likely-benefit wager,&nbsp;often without regard to the actual truth of the matter. Since science does not profess to have a final truth, and in many areas freely admits its incomplete knowledge, Pascal’s wager can provide a useful method of deciding between two alternatives.</p><blockquote><p>All drugs and treatments have side effects, but vaccines in general have the fewest.</p> </blockquote><p>For example, it seems that a significant percentage of the population is suspicious of science, or so we are told. We often hear that some large number, approaching or exceeding half of Americans, do not believe in evolution. This seems remarkable on the face of it because there is no viable scientific opposition to evolution and it is widely accepted by biologists and other life scientists as being fundamental to understanding biology—from genetics to medicine.<br></p><p>What we are not often told is that most of those who answer negatively about believing in evolution nonetheless understand evolution—or at least the basics of it. They are not stupid, ignorant, or uninformed. They have simply made a Pascalian wager. What benefit, we might ask, is derived from believing in evolution rather than a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/how-to-weed-creationism-out-of-schools" target="_blank">divine creation</a>? Unless you are a professional biologist, it is hard to see how this would affect your everyday life. On the other hand, professing a belief in Darwinian evolution over the biblical narrative will likely ostracize you from family, friends, co-workers, your church community—in short most of your social infrastructure. Place your bets.</p><p>Can we apply any of this to decisions over the current controversy surrounding vaccination—and in particular the newly arrived COVID-19 vaccine?</p><p>There are certainly reasons to be concerned about being vaccinated, and it would be a gross over-simplification to consider anyone who expresses reticence about taking a vaccine, this new vaccine in particular, as being just plain dumb or scientifically illiterate or gullible. They need be none of these things and still may be suspicious of the vaccine.<br></p><p>One issue is safety. The vaccine, any vaccine, is designed to mobilize your immune system, essentially to fool it into believing that there is an invading virus present and to mount an immune response. That way it will be ready when the real invasion comes, if it comes. This seems pretty sensible and preferable to going to war with an opponent you know nothing about. But still, it is fooling around with Mother Nature and some people are uneasy about that. Although it must be pointed out that the virus is not at all shy about fooling around with your immune system and many other parts of you, so letting it have its way is not good policy, either.</p><p>What about a vaccine made of genes? This vaccine is being produced by what is being touted as a new method using RNA—genes. While it is true that for entirely economic reasons, this is the first vaccine to be produced in this way, the method is not really new and the science that makes it possible has been developing over the last 40 years. So it’s not so radical as the press makes it seem.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is true that this method uses RNA, genetic material, to make the vaccine. We hear a lot about gene modification and the potential dangers associated with it. Why then am I going to allow RNA, genes, to be injected into me? The first thing to realize is that this is exactly what the virus does—so whether you get a vaccine or an infection, you are getting genes injected into you. The virus RNA encodes around 12 functional genes (by comparison humans and other mammals have around 25,000 genes). The virus only contains the genes to make a new virus—it does not have any of the capabilities of a normal cell to actually turn those genes into the proteins that make up the complete virus. It hijacks your cells to do this—and that’s how it sickens you, by forcing your cells to make new viruses instead of what they should be doing.</p><blockquote><p>Vaccines have fewer side effects than virtually any other drug you wouldn’t even think twice about taking.</p> </blockquote><p>Now the new vaccines have taken just one of those genes—the one that directs the production of the now infamous spike protein that appears on the surface of a normal virus—and injects just that one gene into your muscle cells, which then make that one single protein. Your immune system comes along and sees that weird protein and makes antibodies to it. These same antibodies will now recognize the spike protein on the surface of any viral particles that invade your body. We have effectively turned the virus into its own enemy.</p><p>The viral RNA that you are getting will decompose over a few days because RNA is not a stable molecule (that, by the way, is why the vaccine needs to be kept frozen) and it will no longer exist in your body. It could only become a permanent part of your genome if it were a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule—and even the chances of that happening would be chemically remote. So regardless of how it sounds, this may actually be the safest sort of vaccine to use. In the future it is likely that all vaccines will be made this way.</p><p><span>T</span>hen, of course, there is the issue of who is running this whole vaccine program—the government and the pharmaceutical industry. These are the guys who brought you opioid addiction, death by Vioxx, soaring drug prices, the worst health-care system in the developed world, regulations where you don’t need them and none where you do—am I really going to trust this cast of so-called “inept villains,” as some believe, to dictate my personal health choices? Do we know for sure that the claims of efficacy are real or just made up to sell some worthless procedure? It would not be the first time. (I would not, on the other hand, worry about Bill Gates having a chip inserted into you along with the vaccine—if you use any social media, navigational tools, or purchase anything online, then Bill Gates already knows more about you than he will get from any injectable chip. So that train has left the station.)</p><p>All this and a few lesser issues are worth a pause, for sure. But we must also look on the positive side of the ledger. Why trust science? Modern medicine and the science behind it has eliminated or dramatically lessened such scourges as smallpox, polio, cholera, chicken pox, measles, rabies, and dozens of other killer pathogens that had previously wiped out enormous numbers of people, in some cases significant parts of entire generations. Don’t we depend on science for much of the comfort and safety of our everyday lives? Isn’t science the way we heat our homes, drive to work, fly around the world, have dependable food? Yes, there is the bomb—but there is also anesthesia.<br></p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>When it comes to viruses, the only tool we have to fight them is vaccination. The only tool. Antibiotics are for bacteria, a completely different sort of creature. Sanitation beyond personal hand-washing is ineffective. Vaccines trick the immune system into recognizing the virus earlier than it would otherwise and protect normal cells from invasion by the virus. Tricking the immune system is understandably problematic for people who believe that their body knows best if it’s just kept healthy. This virus, as we have seen from the array of infected people that includes apparently healthy folks, unfortunately does not subscribe to that belief.</p><p>By a similar sort of reasoning, some people make the plausible error of calculating that the vaccine is 95 percent effective but the survival rate is 99 percent, so why not just let my natural resistance take care of this? Indeed, that might not be unreasonable thinking if we were talking about the common cold, but this virus has shown itself to be a tricky character, and we are not yet able to predict who gets a serious case and who a mild one. With those sorts of stakes, you shouldn’t wager on either of those numbers because they have nothing to do with&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;as an individual. Like flipping a coin, there is only a 1 percent chance of it coming up heads 6 times in a row. But if it has come up heads 5 times in a row, the probability of it coming up heads on the next flip is…still 50/50.&nbsp;</p><p>An even larger unknown is whether there may be long-term effects associated with SARS-Cov-2, as is the case for many viruses. The 1918 influenza virus has been linked to a subsequent two-three fold increase in Parkinson’s disease by a mechanism we still don’t understand. The virus that gives children chicken pox will hide out in a person’s body for 40 years or more, and then emerge as a painful, sometimes debilitating, case of shingles. The 99 percent survivability rate of this virus is meaningless if, 20 years from now, it causes some devastating pulmonary or brain disease.</p><p>The main upside to vaccines is that because they use your already existing defense system, they are surprisingly safe. Safer than antibiotics, which have numerous side effects, because they are not part of our normal make up and are …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Protobuf needs no introduction, but this post argues that you shouldn’t use it for telemetry.
The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating.
Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. 
The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the <em>wire-format</em> itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.</p>

<h2 id="protobuf-java-is-a-little-heavy">Protobuf-java is a little heavy</h2>

<p>A few months ago I needed to become familiar with the Protobuf wire-format for a proof of concept.
The motivation for digging in to the wire-format, rather than just using <code>protobuf-java</code>, was the dimensions of the library, which I would need to bundle in an agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> <span>-c</span> %s protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar
1672950

<span>$ </span>jar <span>-tf</span> protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar | <span>grep</span> <span>'.class'</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
669
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just depending on the library adds 1.6MB and nearly 700 classes before you even generate your own message classes.
Since the deployment in question was an agent which can’t assume the presence of <code>protobuf-java</code> at runtime, there is no way to avoid bundling the extra 1.6MB.
Since the aforementioned agent implements <code>ClassLoader</code> isolation to avoid interfering with application class loading, even if <code>protobuf-java</code> <em>is</em> present at runtime, the classes would need to be loaded again by an isolated <code>ClassLoader</code>.</p>

<p>A tracer only needs to <em>produce</em> messages, so not all of those 669 classes (which doesn’t include your own generated classes) will get loaded, but a lot of them do.
Having since implemented library-neutral Protobuf serialisation in Datadog’s <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java">sketches-java</a>, I have a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java/blob/master/src/jmh/java/com/datadoghq/sketch/ddsketch/benchmarks/Serialize.java">point of comparison</a> to show how many classes get loaded in a write-only context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@OutputTimeUnit</span><span>(</span><span>TimeUnit</span><span>.</span><span>MICROSECONDS</span><span>)</span>
<span>@BenchmarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>Mode</span><span>.</span><span>AverageTime</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Serialize</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BuiltSketchState</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>serialize</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sketch</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>().</span><span>array</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>toProto</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>DDSketchProtoBinding</span><span>.</span><span>toProto</span><span>(</span><span>sketch</span><span>).</span><span>toByteArray</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since I mention a Datadog library and am a Datadog employee, I make clear that none of the opinions presented in this post or elsewhere on this blog represent those of my employer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each method produces identical bytes, and the purpose of the benchmark above is to compare speeds.
One of the methods relies on a single class consisting of fewer than 150 lines of code, including white-space, whereas the other depends on a large library.
For the record, the hand-written method <code>serialize</code> above is roughly 10x faster than using <code>protobuf-java</code>, but it’s not the point of this post. 
By running the benchmark for a single warmup iteration each, with the argument <code>-jvmArgsPrepend "-verbose:class"</code>, the classes which are loaded are logged, which I captured in separate files.
276 more classes are loaded when using <code>protobuf-java</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> serialize.log 
1400 serialize.log
<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> to_proto.log 
1676 to_proto.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you work at a large organisation which has entirely embraced Protobuf, I would not suggest worrying about 1.6MB or a few hundred loaded classes; these costs quickly amortise as you use the library for more features.
However, your resource budget for a diagnostic agent which tells you what your application is doing and how it’s performing should be tiny, and I’m not sure <code>protobuf-java</code> can be made to fit in to it, given the isolation constraints for agents outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="length-delimiters-are-costly-to-produce">Length delimiters are costly to produce</h2>

<p>This meant that I needed to write my own (which is a lot easier than it sounds if you haven’t done this sort of thing before) so I had to read the only documentation there is on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding</a>.
I couldn’t get the formatter I had written based on my first reading of this document to produce valid protobuf because I had skim-read the section on embedded messages, and because it includes a design decision that would never have occurred to me.
When I went back and read it again I was surprised to find that embedded messages are length-prefixed, but the length prefix is varint encoded, which means you don’t know how many bytes you need for the length until you’ve done the serialisation, and it’s recursive.</p>

<p>Length prefixes aren’t unusual in binary formats: BSON documents are prefixed by their sizes in bytes, meaning sub-documents need to be serialised recursively before their lengths can be written.
BSON makes this easy by not compressing the document length so you just leave 4 bytes for the length and come back and fill it in when popping document contexts (<a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/shrinking-bson-documents">it can add up to a significant portion of your database though</a>).
Msgpack, for example, <em>does</em> apply prefix compression of embedded element lengths (e.g. maps and arrays) but the length is an element count, not a number of bytes, which makes streaming serialisation a lot easier to do.</p>

<p>Protobuf does both, and, consequently, there’s no way to produce nested Protobuf messages without doing something relatively expensive.
You must either maintain a stack and copy contents from frame to frame as they are popped, or pre-compute serialised lengths of nested elements recursively; it isn’t possible to simply write serialised output sequentially to a stream as it is with other formats. 
I abandoned the proof of concept when I found that a streaming zero-allocation msgpack codec I had written was around 6x faster than either <code>protobuf-java</code> or a handwritten Protobuf codec for messages with nesting.
Since I couldn’t remove the nesting in the messages I needed to produce, I blamed the wire-format and moved on.</p>

<p>People who actually know Protobuf already know this (it’s literally written in the encoding manual), and understand the benefits which arise from this cost elsewhere (e.g. implementing partial deserialisation is easy, easy to skip over sections of the message), but lots of people don’t seem to understand the cost model the wire-format imposes.
If they did, there would probably be a lot less nesting in Protobuf as used in the wild.</p>

<p>This more or less concludes my argument against using Protobuf for telemetry: if you find for yourself that producing Protobuf messages is costly, it’s not even a case of a third party library making the wrong trade-offs for your application; it’s the wire-format itself at fault.
If you want to ship telemetry data out of an application and aim to minimise the impact on the application, even if you implement your own zero-allocation, micro-optimised codec, you shouldn’t choose Protobuf.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to segue into describing the wire-format for Protobuf 3, filling in a couple of the gaps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">Google’s encoding document</a>, but read the official document if you want to write your own.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-wire-format">Notes on the wire format</h2>

<p>Protobuf’s wire format is really simple: it’s just a list of tagged key-value pairs. 
Since readers have a schema to refer to, ambiguity is permissible and advantageous.
The logical structure of a Protobuf message is as below, with each tag followed by some bytes associated with the tag.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tag1:value1, tag3:value2, tag2:value3, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is a pseudo-Backus-Naur form of the wire format.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>body 	         ::= 	tagged_value*
tagged_value     ::=    tag value
tag              ::=    varint((field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type)
wire_type        ::=    VARINT | FIXED_64 | LENGTH_DELIMITED | GROUP_BEGIN | GROUP_END | FIXED_32
VARINT           ::=    0
FIXED_64         ::=    1
LENGTH_DELIMITED ::=    2
GROUP_BEGIN      ::=    3 (deprecated)
GROUP_END        ::=    4 (deprecated)
FIXED_32         ::=    5
value            ::=    varint | fixed_64 | length_delimited | fixed_32
fixed_64         ::=    double | long
length_delimited ::=    varint(N) byte{N}
fixed_32         ::=    float | int
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each data item has a tag, which contains the field number (as defined in the .proto file) and one of the four wire types still in use in Protobuf 3.
The tag is constructed by shifting the field number left by three bits and combining with the wire type, and then <em>varint-encoded</em> so it takes up less space.
Since there are only three bits for the wire type, there can only ever be eight wire types, and two have already been wasted on group begin and end markers (I don’t know the story behind these).
Given that <code>FIXED_32=5</code> with only two possible wire types left, I imagine that there were some tense meetings before deciding to add it.</p>

<p>The terminology above is my own, but notice that there are no terms like <code>repeated</code>, <code>oneof</code>, or <code>message</code>.
This is because they don’t exist at this level. 
<code>message</code> is just a length delimiter followed by some more protobuf, preceded by a <code>LENGTH_DELIMITED</code> tag; the schema has the necessary information to read the raw bytes.
<code>repeated</code> fields come in two kinds: packed and not packed. 
Packed <code>repeated</code> fields are indistinguishable from a <code>message</code> or a <code>string</code> on the wire.
<code>repeated</code> fields which aren’t packed are a list of tag-values with the same field number and the element type in each tag, and they don’t need to be contiguous within the message.
Incidentally, writers aren’t obliged not to repeat non-<code>repeated</code> fields, and as there is nothing to distinguish these fields over the wire, readers are obliged to take the <em>last value</em> for a non-<code>repeated</code> field (which makes some of the partial deserialisers I’ve seen illegal).</p>

<p><code>FIXED_32</code> corresponds to proto types <code>float</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>sfixed32</code>, whereas <code>FIXED_64</code> corresponds to <code>double</code>, <code>fixed64</code>, and <code>sfixed64</code>.
All other integers, which includes booleans, are <em>varint</em> encoded, which has the basic effect of removing leading zeros in order to save space.
Starting with the least significant bits, seven bits are taken at a time from the integer until no bits remain, and all but the last byte have their most significant bit set.
This allows the parser to detect the end of an integer by looking for a byte with the MSB unset. 
Whilst this saves space, it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, I work from home. This means my MacBook is constantly connected to the charger. For Lithium-Ion batteries, it's not healthy to remain charged at 100% all the time. I first noticed that there's a problem when my trackpad wasn't clicking properly anymore. Upon inspection with a ruler, I noticed that the keyboard was curved because the battery had swollen. To replace the swollen battery, the entire Topcase had to be replaced.</p>
<p>To avoid this from happening again, I started looking for a way to control the charging behavior of my MacBook.</p>
<p>In Mac OS Catalina 10.15.5, Apple has introduced a new feature called <code>Battery Health</code>. It is found under <code>System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver</code>. Apple describes the feature as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may reduce your battery's maximum charge when in this mode. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage-reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does that mean exactly? The description in the System Preferences is a bit clearer:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>According to this message, OS X will start reducing the maximum charge of the battery when it ages, to extend its lifespan. In my tests, it drained the battery a bit after being plugged in for a while and then recharged it back to 100%. Since my battery health is still high, it didn't reduce the maximum charge even after being plugged in for multiple days.</p>
<p>This wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to control the maximum charge level myself before the battery was degraded. Lenovo and Tesla are both offering such a feature out of the box, Apple doesn't. Luckily there's a free tool that allows you to take control over the maximum charge level.</p>
<p> <strong>AlDente</strong> gives you the possibility to set a maximum charge level for your MacBook. The tool itself writes this value to the SMC of your MacBook. Most likely it's just using the same feature OS X is using, just more explicitly.</p>

<h2>How to install AlDente</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlDente's Github Page</a> and download the latest release. Then unzip the archive and move <code>AlDente.app</code> to your Applications folder.</p>
<p>Upon opening, you'll probably get a message like <code>AlDente cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>. To work around this, right-click on the application and click <code>Open</code>:</p>

<p>When you start AlDente for the first time, it will ask you to install its helper tool. This is required for AlDente to be able to write the SMC value as root.</p>
<p>Once the app is running, set the value to the maximum you desire. I would recommend a value between <strong>60 and 80 percent</strong> - I chose 70 percent as my sweet spot.</p>
<p>After that, you need to reboot to ensure the value is taken into account. If your battery is currently above your threshold, you'll have to unplug your MacBook, drain it below the threshold and then plug it back in. Once your defined maximum is reached, it will stop charging and display <code>Not Charging</code>.</p>

<h2>Compatible MacBooks</h2>
<p>This should work on every Intel MacBook running Catalina or higher. It is currently <strong>NOT</strong> supported on ARM-based MacBooks. I have successfully tested it on a <strong>2018 MacBook Pro 15"</strong> and a <strong>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</strong>. Based on information from the Github page, the following hardware is also confirmed working:</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 MacBook Pro 13" with 4 TB3 ports</li>
<li>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Pro 13" without TouchBar</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Air 13"</li>
<li>2013 MacBook Pro 13"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uninstalling AlDente</h2>
<p>To uninstall <code>AlDente</code>, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the maximum battery charge to 100%</li>
<li>Exit the application</li>
<li>Move the app to the trash</li>
<li>Remove the helper tool with the commands below</li>
<li>Reboot your MacBook</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove the helper tool, run the following commands in the Terminal:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.davidwernhart.Helper
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.davidwernhart.Helper.plist</code></pre></div>
<p><br>This should do the trick. If you want to be thorough, you can also <a href="https://nicam.dev/support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reset the SMC</a> after uninstalling it.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>
      Instead of simple dots, I wanted the list bullets of the index of <a href="https://blog.steren.fr&quot;/">my blog</a> to be the date at which articles were written. It turns out HTML+CSS can do that easily.
    <br>
      Here is how I created a list with custom bullets, taking their value from an HTML attribute.
    </p>

    <p>The HTML markup of my index page, note the <code>year="2020"</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;ol class="pages"&gt;
  &lt;li year="2020"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/my-article/"&gt;My article of 2020&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>And the CSS magic. we customize the bullet with <code>::marker</code> and read the HTML attribute with <code>attr()</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>.pages {
    padding-inline-start: 6ch;
  }

  .pages li::marker {
    content: attr(year) " - ";
  }</code></pre>

    <p>Here is how it displays:</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>The idea of this post is to introduce and discuss several interesting research programs from the past decade. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">research program</a> (or programme) refers to a common thread of research that shares similar assumptions, methodology, etc. The list below contains a variety of research programs: some on topics that have broad appeal e.g. <a href="#machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">explainable machine learning</a> and <a href="#the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">mental disorder</a>; others moved the direction of entire industries e.g. advances in <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">computer vision</a> and <a href="#blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>; and others still are more niche areas that I happen to be deeply interested in e.g. <a href="#topological-learning-theory">topological learning theory</a>, <a href="#privacy-attacks-on-machine-learning-models">privacy attacks on ML models</a>, and <a href="#the-graph-theoretic-approach-to-epistemic-justification">graph-theoretic approaches to epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, a list of this variety can never be complete and is surely biased by what I happen to be reading. If I’ve missed something interesting that you enjoy, let me know at <a href="mailto:brettcmullins@gmail.com">brettcmullins@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="image-recognition-and-object-detection">Image Recognition and Object Detection</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is difficult for me to begin this list without first talking about the area that most affected my professional career, led to (or at least accelerated) a boom in data science, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history">potentially thawed an AI winter</a>. During the 2010s, <a href="https://bmk.sh/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/">deep learning made enormous progress</a> in heuristics and applications. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a> in particular, a good starting point is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a> in 2012 which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> architecture to substantially surpass existing benchmarks for image recognition - the task of assigning a label such as <em>cat</em>, <em>dog</em>, or <em>tree</em> to an image - on the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a>. Over the next few years, improvements would continue with architectures such as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c">VGG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNet</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">Inception</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>With progress being made with recognition, other tasks such as object detection - finding and labeling objects (sometimes multiple objects) within images - became more feasible. One approach to object detection introduced in 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524">Regional CNNs (or R-CNNs)</a> combined a model that first produced promising bounding boxes then utilized the newly developed recognition models (starting with AlexNet) to classify or label the regions in the bounding boxes. Over the next few years, progress in this direction was realized with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Fast R-CNN</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Faster R-CNN</a>. These frameworks not only employed better recognition models and found better bounding boxes, but they integrated the model components together so that they could be more efficiently trained or tailored to one’s application. <a href="https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4">Here is an excellent overview</a> of these models with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>Accompanying these new techniques and improvements was a large amount of software - with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffe_(software)">Caffe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)">Torch</a> at first then the more user friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras">Keras</a> - allowing anyone to implement these models for their use cases. It’s also worth mentioning the proliferation of online courses such as <a href="https://fast.ai/">fast.ai’s</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> that facilitated getting potential users up to speed to test out and deploy these tools.</p>

<h2 id="topological-learning-theory">Topological Learning Theory</h2>
<hr>

<p>Topological Learning Theory is the mathematical study of the learnability/solvability of hypotheses/problems that is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">theory of computation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">descriptive set theory</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference">classical statistics</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory">statistical learning theory</a>). The idea of learning theory is to analyze the learnability of hypotheses as one incrementally receives information about the true state of the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3858127/pexels-photo-3858127.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" width="200" height="350"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#1.1">classic example</a> is to consider an ornithologist observing the color of ravens as, say, black or not. With each raven observed, the ornithologist gains information which rules out some hypotheses but is consistent with others. By coding a black raven as 1 and other ravens as 0, we can mathematically represent possible observation histories as infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, i.e. points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space">Cantor space</a>. The crux of this approach is that the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_11/Lecture_Notes/dst_lecture_notes_2011_lec_2.pdf">topology on the Cantor space and other such spaces</a> naturally <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/kelly/learnreview.pdf">encodes the idea of information accumulation</a>. By considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy">descriptive complexity of hypotheses</a>, identifying a hypothesis with the set of sequences that make it true, we can say things about the learnability of the hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis “all ravens are black” is the set containing the single sequence of all 1s. We say that this hypothesis is falsifiable since if there is a non-black raven our ornithologist will eventually observe it; however, it is verifiable not in finite time but in the limit since the hypothesis is never conclusively true after any finite number of observations. This corresponds to the topological notion of properly being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%CF%83_set">$F_{\sigma}$ or $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/kevin-kelly.html">Kevin Kelly’s</a> 1996 <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-logic-of-reliable-inquiry-9780195091953?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Logic of Reliable Inquiry</em></a> has been an authoritative text on formal learning theory in the Cantor space and other <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Polish+space">Polish spaces</a>. Advances in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computable+analysis">computable analysis</a> beginning in the early 2000s have enabled the extension of these classical formal learning theory results to a more general topological setting throughout the 2010s. The paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540109001631?via%3Dihub"><em>Topological Properties of Concept Spaces</em></a> from 2010 is the first to connect these computable analysis results to learning theory. By 2015, a pair of papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07518"><em>On the Solvability of Inductive Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/TARK2015-proceedings.pdf#page=119"><em>Theory Choice, Theory Change, and Inductive Truth-Conduciveness</em></a> - both presented at the <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/tark15.html">TARK 2015 conference</a> - provide complete topological characterizations of learnability/solvability in the limit as well as connections to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-belief-revision/">belief revision theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham’s Razor</a> in this more general topological setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">The Disordered Mind Theory of Mental Illness</h2>
<hr>

<p>In a series of articles and books over the past decade, the philosopher <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/george-graham">George Graham</a> develops a theory of mental disorder with the following qualities: 1. is non-reductionist with respect to the mind and the brain; 2. is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a>; and 3. coheres with the experiences of patients and clinicians. Graham’s theory holds that mental illness is distinct from somatic/bodily illness though may co-occur or otherwise be bound up with so-called <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07609-001">broken brains</a>. A helpful analogy for what is meant here by “the mental” or “the mind” is to view the brain as computer hardware, whereas the mind is software. On this picture, the mind and the brain are surely not independent; a hardware issue may impede the computation of some software. However, one may have bugs in one’s software - “gumming up the works” to use a common phrase of Graham - on perfectly functioning hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978036732/9780367322328.jpg" width="200" height="280"></p>

<p>This theory of mental disorder is developed in Graham’s text on mental illness in the context of the philosophy of mind: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Disordered-Mind/Graham/p/book/9780367322328"><em>The Disordered Mind</em></a>. A follow-up book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-abraham-dilemma-9780198728658?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Abraham Dilemma</em></a>, refines this theory for the case of delusion, religious delusion in particular (I discuss <em>The Abraham Dilemma</em> in greater detail in my <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/top-books-2020/#the-abraham-dilemma-a-divine-delusion">Top Books in 2020</a>). Graham’s latest book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/hearing-voices-and-other-matters-of-the-mind-9780190091149?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind</em></a> explores the unique properties and challenges of mental disorders in the presence of religious content. The disordered mind theory <a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-disordered-mind-an-introduction-to-philosophy-of-mind-and-mental-illness/">is not without its detractors</a> who hold that Graham goes too far in arguing that one need not situate and commit to positions in the philosophy of mind to reject the complete reduction of mental illness to neuroscience.</p>

<p>I took George Graham’s seminar on Philosophy and Mental Illness in 2014 at <a href="https://philosophy.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> and had several interesting chats with him about the metaphysics and definability of mental disorders.</p>

<hr>

<p>The boom in data science and widespread use of machine learning models during the past decade was accelerated by innovations in model architectures as well as tools and software to train and deploy these models. In addition to the <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">progress with neural networks and deep learning</a>, algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost">XGBoost</a> allowed users to achieve state-of-the-art classification and regression performance without much effort. XGBoost in particular became so prevalent in both industry and ML competitions - as had logistic regression and other GLMs in the past - that it was not unreasonable for some to wonder whether or not <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d">we should just use XGBoost all the time</a>.</p>

<p>For all that these models gained in performance, they lost ground in being able to provide answers to questions from stakeholders, developers, and so forth when things went wrong as to why a model’s prediction was so far off or why does the computer vision model <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">think a banana is a toaster</a>. Two approaches were offered as a solution (three if you count “Who cares?! Let’s do nothing!”): interpretability and explanations. The former offers constraints on model building such as limiting the number of features used and restricting to linear models so that the model is sufficiently simple to allow the developer/user to reliably predict the model’s behavior with a reasonable amount of effort. The latter is a set of methods for generating reasons for a model’s behavior for arbitrarily complex models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490"><em>The Mythos of Model Interpretability</em></a> is an early effort to disentangle these terms and map the landscape for understanding models. Also see <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_blackboxes/">my attempt here</a> as well as Christoph Molnar’s ever-evolving text <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a>.</p>

<p><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://bcmullins.github.io/images/blog/best_articles_2018/anchor.png"></p>

<p>The approach that I find the most compelling stems from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME paper</a>. LIME (or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) is a method of generating an interpretable, i.e. linear, approximation of a model in the neighborhood of a given point in the feature space. This new model is then used to generate explanations by virtue of its interpretability. A second approach for classifiers called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a> - both are developed by the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/group.html">same research group at UW</a> that also developed XGBoost - produces a simple region of the feature space (a rectangle) where the model’s prediction holds with high probability for a given point. This region or anchor acts as a sort of sufficiency condition for classification. The image to the right illustrates these ideas with the dotted line being a local linear approximation and the …</p></div></div>

    <p>Google AI recently released a paper, <em>Rethinking Attention with Performers</em>
<a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>, which introduces <em>Performer</em>, a Transformer
architecture which estimates the full-rank-attention mechanism using orthogonal
random features to approximate the softmax kernel with linear space and time
complexity. In this post we will investigate how this works, and how it is
useful for the machine learning community.</p>

<h2 id="the-kernel-trick">The Kernel Trick</h2>

<p>Before we talk about Attention, it is important to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method#Mathematics:_the_kernel_trick">kernel
trick</a>.
Gregory Gundersen gives a great explanation on his
<a href="http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/12/10/kernel-trick/">blog</a>, but we will go over a
brief summary here. This section is not completely necessary for understanding
<em>Performers</em>, but might provide some helpful context.</p>

<p>Say we have some data $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/circles.png" alt="circles"></p>

<p>We can see that this data is not linearly separable, i.e. if we wanted to fit a
logistic regression or linear support vector machine (SVM) to the data we
wouldn’t be able to. How do we get around this? We can map the data into a
higher dimension, say $\mathbb{R}^3$, using a function 
$\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^3$:</p><p>

\[\varphi \left(\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} \right)
 = \begin{bmatrix} x_1^2 \\ x_2^2 \\ \sqrt{2}x_1 x_2 \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>This function $\varphi$ is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel">polynomial
kernel</a> of degree $d=2$. If we
apply it to our data, $x$, we can visualize that it becomes linearly separable:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/poly_circles.png" alt="poly circles"></p>

<p>Now we can recall the expression for fitting a linear SVM:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j})\]

</p><p>Don’t worry if this expression is unfamiliar, just note that we are computing a
dot product between two samples $\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j}$, and repeating
this process many times.
If we want to use our kernel function $\varphi$ so that the data is linearly seperable,
we can simple wrap each $x_n$ with $\varphi$ to map it into a higher dimension:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)})\]

</p><p>Now we could stop here, but we can make this more efficient. What we have so far
requires computing $\varphi(x_n)$, $N$ times, and the dot-product
$\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)$, $N^2$ times, which could start becoming very
computationally expensive, especially with kernel functions that map to very
high dimensions. How do we get around this? This is where the <strong>kernel trick</strong> comes
in. Suppose we had a function $K : \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$
where:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>If we can find a $K$ that performs this operation in a lower dimensional space,
we can save potentially great amounts of compute. For the polynomial kernel
$\varphi$ defined above, finding $K$ is fairly straight forward (derivation is
left as an exercise to the reader):</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i^\top x_j)^2 = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>We are now doing the dot-product in lower dimensional space, but we will get the
same result as performing the dot-product after the projection. This means we
can rewrite our linear SVM expression one more time:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j \textcolor{blue}{K(x_i, x_j)}\]

</p><p>Now instead of doing a dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we are doing it in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. This might not make much of an impact in terms of computational
cost in this case, but it can make a much bigger difference with more complex
kernel functions and higher dimensional data. Next, we will see how <strong>Random
Fourier Features</strong> can reduce the computational cost of some kernel functions <em>even more</em>.</p>

<h2 id="random-fourier-features">Random Fourier Features</h2>

<p>In <em>Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines</em> <a href="#rahimi2007random">(Rahimi &amp; Recht, 2007)</a>
(which won the NIPS “Test of Time” award in 2017, ten years after it was
published), they set out to approximate $K$ using a randomized feature map 
$z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p>Specifically, they prove theoretically that the Gaussian or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel">RBF
kernel</a>:</p><p>

\[K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(-\gamma \lVert x_i - x_j \rVert^2)\]

</p><p>Can be approximated by sampling $z$ from the Fourier transformation. Concretely,
one way we can write this as is:</p><p>

\[z_\omega(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_ R(0, I) $ is sampled from a spherical Gaussian.
With this approximation, the dot-product no longer needs to be performed in
$\mathbb{R}^L$ space, it can now be performed in $\mathbb{R}^R$ space, where
$R \ll L$. How is this useful? <strong>Using Random Fourier Features, we can
approximate any function $K$ that can be written in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$.</strong></p>

<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://teddykoker.com/2020/02/nlp-from-scratch-annotated-attention/">previous blog post</a>, we went over
the <em>self-attention</em> mechanism, an how it was introduced for language
translation. Nowadays, most language models use <em>scaled-dot-product attention</em> as
defined in the <em>Transformers</em> paper <a href="#vaswani2017attention">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</a>:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) =
\text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right) V\]

</p><p>Where $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$, $L$ is the sequence length, and $d$
is some hidden dimension. We can expand the $\text{softmax}$ and rewrite
the expression as the following:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = D^{-1}AV, \quad
A = \exp(QK^\top/\sqrt{d}), \quad
D = \text{diag}(A 1_L)\]

</p><p>Where $1_L$ is a vector of ones of length $L$. In Python this looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>attention</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>):</span>
    <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>q</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>q</span> <span>@</span> <span>k</span><span>.</span><span>T</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>**</span> <span>-</span><span>0.5</span><span>))</span>
    <span>d_inv</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>diag</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>@</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ones</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>d_inv</span> <span>@</span> <span>a</span> <span>@</span> <span>v</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This $\text{Attention}$ method has some limitations however; if we
examine the attention matrix, $A$, we will realize it is of shape $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, meaning that any operation performed with $A$ will have a time
and space complexity that grows <strong>quadratically</strong> with respect to the sequence
length $L$. This puts a limitation on the maximum sequence length that can be
used with the Transformer, which means they are not usable for many tasks that
may require much longer sequence lengths, such as dialog, protein sequences, and
images.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, many have developed their own “X-former” to
reduce this complexity, and this is becoming a growing area of research; for a
full survey see <a href="#tay2020efficient">(Tay et al., 2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performer">Performer</h2>

<h3 id="softmax-kernel">Softmax Kernel</h3>

<p>The <em>Performer</em> <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>  seeks to reduce the
complexity of Attention using random Fourier features. Using the equation above,
we can factor out the normalization component, $\sqrt{d}$, in the
computation of $A$:</p><p>

\[A = \exp \left(
\frac{Q}{\sqrt[4]{d}}
\left( \frac{K}{\sqrt[4]{d}} \right)^\top
\right)\]

</p><p>As we continue, we will assume that this normalization is applied beforehand, so
we can rewrite as simply:</p><p>

\[A = \exp(QK^\top)\]

</p><p>Now lets say we define a softmax kernel, $K_\text{softmax} : \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ as:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(x_i^\top x_j)\]

</p><p>Using this softmax kernel, we can rewrite the computation of any element within
$A$:</p><p>

\[A(i, j) = K_\text{softmax}(q_i^\top,k_j^\top)\]

</p><p>Where $q_i$, $k_j$, represent the $i^\text{th}$,
$j^\text{th}$ row vector in $Q$, $K$, respectively.</p>

<p>Since the attention matrix is now written as the output of a kernel function $K_\text{softmax}$,
we could potentially approximate it at a <strong>lower dimensionality</strong> as we did for the Gaussian kernel above
feature mapping $z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K_{softmax}(x_i, x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p><em>Note: <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a> uses $\varphi$ to denote this random
feature mapping, I am using $z$ for consistency.</em> Working from the definition of
the Gaussian kernel function, we can derive $K_\text{softmax}$
in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) =
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_i \rVert^2}{2} \right)
K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j)
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_j \rVert^2}{2} \right)\]

</p><p>See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for full derivation. With this derivation, we can
come up with our random feature mapping $z_\omega$ that approximates
the $K_\text{softmax}$ kernel using the Random Fourier features approximation of
the Gaussian kernel:</p><p>

\[z_\omega^\text{sin/cos}(x) = 
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x \rVert^2}{2} \right)
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where, again, $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_R(0, I)$ is sampled from a spherical
Gaussian. <strong>Now, instead of our attention matrix $A$ being of size $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, it is only of size $\mathbb{R}^{R \times L}$, with the sum of each
row approximating that of it’s full-rank counterpart.</strong></p>

<p>This looks quite complex at this point, but we can now write the full
approximated attention mechanism, $\widehat{\text{Attention}}(Q, K, V)$, in Python like so:</p>

<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies that law enforcement may use at protests and other public gathering to spying on people exercising their fundamental rights. Learn how to spot the surveillance so you can advocate effectively for the policies necessary to protect your rights and bring transparency to the police surveillance.</p>

<p>If you attend a protest, demonstration or any mass gathering in a public space, the police are probably surveilling you. Whether it’s sophisticated facial recognition, ubiquitous video recording, or the instant analysis of our biometric data, law enforcement agencies are following closely behind their counterparts in the military and intelligence services in acquiring privacy-invasive technologies, from automated license plate readers to body-worn cameras to drones and more.  In this talk, Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies in use:
<br>	• Where to look for these devices
<br>	• How these technologies look
<br>	• How these technologies function
<br>	• How they are used by police
<br>	• What kind of data they collect
<br>	• Where to learn more about them
<br>Knowledge is power. Knowing what technologies are in use can help you understand the threats to your privacy and security, as well as tools to advocate for limits on police use of surveillance that may chill people’s rights to express themselves on public issues.  Just as analog surveillance historically has been used as a tool for oppression, policymakers and the public must understand the threat posed by emerging technologies to successfully defend human rights in the digital age. </p>

<p>This talk will be about FPMON, a browser extension that shows you where, when and which browser fingerprinting method is applied against you. You can use it to test your favorite websites and check your own services for 3rd-party fingerprinting scripts. It can also be used to test various browser privacy tools.</p>

<p>Tracking users is a ubiquitous practice in the web today. User activity is recorded on a large scale and analyzed by various actors to create personalized products, forecast future behavior, and prevent online fraud. While so far HTTP cookies have been the weapon of choice, new and more pervasive techniques such as browser fingerprinting are gaining traction. Hence, in this talk, we describe how users can be empowered against fingerprinting by showing them when, how, and who is tracking them using JavaScript fingerprinting. To this end, we conduct a systematic analysis of various fingerprinting tools. Based on this analysis, we design and develop FPMON: a light-weight and comprehensive fingerprinting monitor that measures and rates JavaScript fingerprinting activity on any given website in real-time. Using FPMON, we evaluate the 10k most popular websites to i) study the pervasiveness of JavaScript fingerprinting; ii) review the latest fingerprinting countermeasures; and iii) identify the major networks that foster the use of fingerprinting. Our evaluations reveal that i) fingerprinters are present on many popular websites with sensitive contents (finance, news, NGOs, health, etc.); ii) they run without user consent and subvert current privacy regulations; and iii) most countermeasures can not sufficiently protect users.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=473">‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’</a> by Donald Knuth from 2001. Recommended reading if you like reading about how a world-renowned computer scientist wrote a book about how he wrote a book that deals with another book! Sounds recursive 😏</p>



<p>That last book is of course the bible and the book Knuth wrote about it is <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=1">‘3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated ‘</a> — published in 1991. And in 1999 Knuth gave <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">a series of lectures at MIT</a> <em>‘on the general subject of relations between faith and science’.</em> In these lectures he explains how he went about writing this book and the thought process involved. So the lectures make for an enjoyable deep dive on creating such a book and how Knuth’s brain works, paired with discussions and insights on religion and things like eternity and finiteness.</p>



<p>And it is this series of lectures that are bundled together in ‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’ — almost verbatim. But, the lectures have also always been available as audio files (sadly no visuals) on <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">Knuth’s homepage</a>. And I listened to those a few years back, and as I read this book I was reminded that I had created a RSS feed for these files, <strong>effectively creating a Knuth podcast!</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml"><img loading="lazy" src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.jpeg 1550w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>This is a later picture of Donald Knuth and not from the 1999 lectures. I added the text, of course in the <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern">only possible font</a>.<br>(I have no copyright on this picture and couldn’t find out who did actually. Feel free to drop me a line if I can accredit you, or if you want it changed.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I mostly created the file for myself to have the convenience of listening to the lectures in a podcast player. But I have also dropped the link to the XML file <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21967785">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19688748">there</a> over the years, and I noticed 607 <strong>unique</strong> IP addresses hit this link this month alone! There are only six lectures and one panel discussion and never any new content, so I am not sure what these numbers mean, if they mean anything at all. </p>



<p>But I also remembered I had never blogged about this, until now. So without further ado here is the link: </p>



<p><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml">https://j11g.com/knuth.xml</a></p>



<p>You can add this to your favorite podcast player. I have added the feed to Overcast myself so <a href="https://piks.nl/upload/upload/_pn_2020-12-29_11-02-22.png">it looks like this</a> which is nice.</p>



<p>Having the audiofiles available in a podcast player enables you to track progress, speed up/down parts and have an <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/1223317202478211076">enhanced</a> audio experience.</p>



<p>I do remember writing an email (<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">no hyphen</a>) to Knuth’s office and I received a nice reply that they thought it was <em>‘a great idea’</em>, and they were actually also thinking of starting their own podcast ‘<em>based on these materials’</em>. However I haven’t found any link to this yet, so for now it is just this.</p>



<p>If you are more into video, here is a great conversation Donald Knuth had with Lex Fridman last year. Published exactly a year ago to this day. The video is not embeddable but  you can click the image to go there. Recommended.</p>

<![CDATA[Psychological Triggers Used in Growth Hacking]]>

<br/>
December 30, 2020 | https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The triggers discussed in this post are powerful levers to influence peoples decision making processes. Never ever abuse this knowledge. Apply it in ethical ways and call out unethical usage when you spot it in the wild.</p>
<p>Your Landing Page is finally live and the metrics are promising but your conversion rates are still a little bit behind? It seems like there's some interest in your product but for some reason people aren't convinced enough to click that call-to-action.</p>
<p>Maybe you're running an ecommerce store and sales are great. But aren't there any tweaks you can apply to increase your sales even further?</p>
<p>Sometimes all that's necessary is a little nudge. In this blog post we'll examine what that nudge might be. How you can drive more attention towards action-taking rather than closing the browser tab and moving on. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Human needs</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is by no means a scientific write-up. If you're interested in the fascinating topic of Psychology I'd encourage you to pick up some legit literature such as "Thinking Fast and Slow" or to connect with an expert who majored in Psychology.</p>
<p>Before jumping right into the triggers, let's take a step back and understand why knowing the basics of human psychology is such an important and fascinating skill to possess.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything we do on a day-to-day is somehow influenced by our unconscious, the part of our being we cannot directly control. One of the many sources of information that has formed and still informs our unconscious is the basics of human behavior and desires. At the core, humans are very social beings. Forming tribes helped us survive and thrive in uncertain times. It's important for us to show that we're worthy being part of the tribe. Being an outsider by taking unapproved actions put oneself at huge risks and disadvantages. Risks that usually translated into pain and death. As it turned out, it made a whole lot of sense to play by the rules and adhere to the consensus.</p>
<p>Times have changed and nowadays there's a lot less risk involved when making decisions. However the tribal thinking is still deeply rooted in ourselves and therefore influences the actions we take.</p>
<p>Do you study reviews before buying products online? Do you browse through the comments on a YouTube video? Both of those actions are driven by the fact that we want to see what our peers are thinking and how they might think about us when we buy the item in question or like the videos content.</p>
<h2>The Triggers</h2>
<p>Now that we learned more about basic human needs and what drives us, it's time to take a deep dive into the different Psychological Triggers you can use to tap into those needs and nudge your visitors to take certain actions.</p>
<h3>1. Me vs. You</h3>
<p>To some extent, everyone is an egoist. While that might sound harsh it's a reality that people are obsessed with themselves. Knowing this puts you at a huge advantage because you can articulate your copywriting in a way that speaks directly to your users "self".</p>
<p>Don't talk about your company, the achievements and prizes you won. Don't write a wall of text outlining every single feature your product offers. Your company is in the business since the late 90s? Your app has a "dark mode"? That's all great but <strong>nobody really cares</strong>!</p>
<p>What matters are the benefits your users will experience when using your product. What are they dreaming about? What pain does your product address? How does your product help them live a better life? That's all that matters.</p>
<p>Update your copywriting to talk directly to your users rather than about you. Paint a picture of their dream and how your product helps them turn that dream into a reality.</p>
<h3>2. Making Progress</h3>
<p>There are only 9 pages left to complete the chapter in your favorite book? You only have to collect one more item to reach the next level in your favorite video game?</p>
<p>People love to make progress. It just feels good to take a project all the way from 0% to 100%. Even better if the progress is visualized and you can see the progress bar increasing with every little step of the way.</p>
<p>Use this love for progress in your products and services. Do you have a time-consuming onboarding process? Break it up into individual pieces and show a progress bar at the top of the page which updates as your users fill out the forms. Are you looking for more Newsletter sign ups? Display a "50% done" progress bar at the top of your Newsletter Form and call out that your visitor is "almost there".</p>
<p>Whenever you're looking for more commitment from your users, break the task down into individual pieces and add some information which makes it clear as to what the current status is and what is necessary to make progress.</p>
<h3>3. Time</h3>
<p>Time is one of the resources which cannot be created. Time will move on, no matter what you do. Given this, everyone values their time more than anything else.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways you can work with the "Time trigger".</p>
<p>The first one being to call out how much your product will help your users save time. Do you automate a time-consuming process? Do the math and clearly show your users how much time they'll save when they use your app. Time they can spend with their significant other or kids (you want to call that out as well).</p>
<p>Another usage of the "Time trigger" can often be found in conjunction with scarcity. "25% for the next 24 hours", "Registrations only open today". Those are the phrases you'll usually find on ecommerce stores or online course websites. You can do the same and offer time-bound discounts. If you do so, please make sure that your offer is legit. Use time and scarcity in a dishonest way and you'll immediately lose trust.</p>
<h3>4. Comparing and Contrasting</h3>
<p>The "Basic Plan" is 99 USD while the "Pro Plan" which has significantly more features is only 129 USD? Most people would pick the "Pro Plan" given that it has more features to offer. Even if those features will never be used. Looking at it through the lens of logic it doesn't really make sense to go with the "Pro Plan" if the "Basic Plan" would be more than enough in terms of value delivered.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it's not about what the product is, it's about what it stands next to. You can use this fact to steer the decision making process in the direction of your liking. Make it easy for your users to compare and contrast different offerings. Even if you don't plan to sell a cheaper option, offer it anyway and put it next to the one which is slightly more expensive but more feature rich. You'd be amazed to see that most of your users will go with the more expensive option even if they'll never user all the features it offers.</p>
<h3>5. Fear</h3>
<p>A huge major driving force which is ingrained in everyone of us is fear. Fear comes in many different forms. We're fearful of failure, bad things happening to our loved ones and the inevitable death.</p>
<p>Another form of fear is the "fear of missing out" a.k.a FOMO. Always being in the known gives us huge advantages and an edge over our competition. Missing out on a major new trend or business opportunity could have detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>You can trigger the "fear of missing out" by subtly talking about the possibility of missing out on a huge opportunity when passing on your offering.</p>
<p>A prime example which shows this in action are travel booking websites. Remember that "12 people have visited this listing in the last 6 hours" notification on the hotel website. You don't want to be the person who misses out on this great deal!</p>
<h3>6. Social Proof</h3>
<p>As we already learned, us humans are social animals. Being social doesn't only mean that we like to socialize with each other, it also means that we tend to mimic and "copy" one another to be more likeable and therefore accepted in our peer group.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy something but you're not sure which option to go with? It might be a good idea to study the testimonials, reviews and ratings to make a more informed decision. The new Todo-app you just discovered looks quite compelling but why bother given that you're already using the stock Todo-app on your phone? As it turns out, at least a handful of Fortune 500 companies and Silicon Valley juggernauts are using it in their day-to-day so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>You want to be a part of your tribe so naturally you're looking at what your peers are doing. This is what "Social Proof" is all about. Showing that you're about to make the right decision because peers in your tribe did the same.</p>
<p>Do you already have happy customers using your app? Take some time to conduct some interviews and translate those into testimonials you can put on your Landing Page. Maybe you have some large enterprises using your product. Write some Case Studies to show what value your product offers. There are entire software applications you can use to display social proof widgets on your homepage or ecommerce store ("Someone in New York bought this item 2 hours ago").</p>
<h3>7. Acting logical</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to believe that all the decisions she makes are entirely driven by logic. As it turns out this is not true most of the time. You and I buy products based on emotion rather than logic. Just pay close attention to the advertisements you see every day. Almost every single one speaks in the language of emotions rather than logic.</p>
<p>But once the decision has been made and the purchase is done we tend to justify our actions based on logic. "I bought the car because there was a discount and a friend of mine knows the car dealership owner.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am pretty much a knowledge addict.</p>
<p>I use Twitter, RSS, and numerous other mediums of information — from Telegram channels to standalone blogs.</p>
<p>Out of a thousand articles a hundred gets skimmed through. A few dozens make it to my "Read Later" list, and only a fraction I find worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>These worthy ones end up in <a href="https://drobinin.com/newsletter/">my weekly newsletter, the Tuesday Triage</a>, where I comment on the most intriguing articles I've read and share facts I learnt over the week.</p>
<p>Some of those trivia are not trivial at all, so I decided to condense this <em>crème de la crème of the Internet</em> in a subjective list of the best ones in no particular order.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="solresol"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol">Solresol</a> <a href="#solresol">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people know about the esperanto, an artificially created language. Way less people are aware of Solresol, another artificial language, built upon the musical grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your health good? - Redofafa?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the countryside this year? - Fadoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the theatre tonight? - Soldoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Sol-resol.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="logbook"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbook</a> <a href="#logbook">¶</a></h4>
<p>As developers we work with logs a lot. And the logs are stored in logbooks (or at least they were). What's the ethymology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how come a chip log was used to estimate a ship's speed? In the absence of GPS and without any visible clues about the speed of a ship in the open water, sailors started to throw wooden pieces with a tied strope (hence the definition of knots as nautical miles per hour!) into water and then measure the relative speed against such logs, hence the name.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="popcorn-in-the-1800s"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn#Consumption">Popcorn in the 1800s</a> <a href="#popcorn-in-the-1800s">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't surprise me when I think about this as a dish, and yet I'd probably never come up with that on my own.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="danakil-depression"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danakil_Depression">Danakil Depression</a> <a href="#danakil-depression">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Danakil Depression is the northern part of the Afar Triangle or Afar Depression in Ethiopia, a geological depression that has resulted from the divergence of three tectonic plates in the Horn of Africa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The year is 1974. The American National Standards Institute introduces safety code and requirements for dry martinis, and boy-oh-boy are they good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p><em>Gibson.</em><br>
An unpardonable form of perversion. See onion soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test Methods</p>
<p>[...] In testing, the taster shall watch for lightness of color, absence of sediment, a delicate aroma that effectively combines the scent of the juniper with the herbal infusion in the vermouth, a taste that is both sharp and clean with a faint body, and a light delicate aftertaste.</p>

<h4 id="by-the-bye"><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/57078/by-the-bye-etymology-and-usage">By the bye</a> <a href="#by-the-bye">¶</a></h4>
<p>This example left me, to put it succinctly, flabbergasted for a brief moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>by the by or by the bye : INCIDENTALLY [defined as "by way of interjection or digression : by the way"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if it will help me to up the game of interrupting folks in conversations.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pie-barm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">Pie Barm</a> <a href="#pie-barm">¶</a></h4>
<p>Watch after my hands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ferment a liquid (beer, wine, or stock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take the foam from the top of the liquid (this is called <strong>barm</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use this foam to leaven a bread roll, and then put something inside it (now this is called a <strong>barm cake</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we do all of that in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, we most likely would put a pie as a filling (they also host the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-46620294/world-pie-eating-champion-crowned-in-wigan">World Pie Eating Championship</a>, so no surprise). And here it is, the pie barm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wigan, a whole savoury pie is served in a barm cake, known locally as a "Wigan Kebab".</p>

<h4 id="two-spaces-after-period"><a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/">Two spaces after period</a> <a href="#two-spaces-after-period">¶</a></h4>
<p>Back then people had to put two spaces after punctuation marks as typewriters had monospaced typesetting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why: Back when we used typewriters, every character was given the exact same amount of space on the page. That meant the letter i was given the same amount of space as the letter m, even though it clearly didn’t need it. This is called monospaced typesetting and it’s, well, spacey. We needed that extra space between sentences to make it easier to see the beginning of new sentences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days quite a few still do that; usually one can easily assume they've learnt to type not on a computer.</p>
<p>Rarely, one encounters someone like me, with a typewriter next to the keyboard, and just thinks I am stupid and don't know thine grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="erstwhile"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile">erstwhile</a> <a href="#erstwhile">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a beautiful word I unearthed recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverb erstwhile has been part of English since the 16th century, but it is formed from two words that are much older. It comes from the Old English words ær, meaning "early", and hwīl, which has much the same meaning as the modern word while. (The English word ere, meaning "before," is also descendant of ær.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as a synonim to "former", e.g "erstwhile enemies".</p>

<h4 id="children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail"><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-children-sent-through-mail-180959372/">Children used to be sent through the Mail</a> <a href="#children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am just surprised that this practice was eventually banned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia. According to Lynch, Baby James was just shy of the 11-pound weight limit for packages sent via Parcel Post, and his “delivery” cost his parents only 15 cents in postage (although they did insure him for $50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postage was cheaper than train tickets back then (and still is, actually), so I can't really blame the parents.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ek-number"><a href="https://digg.com/2018/how-different-countries-laugh-online">ek number</a> <a href="#ek-number">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I realize that speaking in one (two, three, ...) languages means there are corners of the Internet and/or world you can't appreciate, in the first place because you can't understand them.</p>
<p>So while knowing both English and Russian is usually more than enough to find an answer to almost any question, I still miss the jewels like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ek number," which loosely translates to "I rate this number one" — the "ek" itself means "one" in Hindi — is commonly used as an affirmative response to a joke. If you find something to be funny, you could always type "haha" or "hehe" in India, but you can also signal your enjoyment by responding "ek number."</p>

<h4 id="remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips"><a href="http://www.dandelionchocolate.com/2020/06/18/remy-chocolate-chip/">Remy Labesque and chocolate chips</a> <a href="#remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips">¶</a></h4>
<p>Chocolate chips have a water drop's shape because it's easier to make that way. It's harder to use though.</p>
<p>Remy Labesque, one of Tesla's designers, helped Dandelion Chocolate to invent a machine to make ideal chocolate chips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of a typical store-bought chocolate chip is an arbitrary result of the industrial manufacturing process used to make it. As you might expect, a drop of molten chocolate is deposited onto a flat surface and left to cool. Chocolate chip taste varies widely by brand, but the shape of the chips does not.</p>
<p>The shape of our chip is faceted: The edges of a Dandelion Chocolate chip taper to thin-as-we could-make-’em without compromising structure. This is because the thermal mass of a thin piece of chocolate melts more quickly on the palate. So when you put a Dandelion chip on your tongue, the thin, chiseled edges warm-to-melt nearly instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 lb of these chips costs 30$, not bad.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ogden's-basic-english"><a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/">Ogden's Basic English</a> <a href="#ogden's-basic-english">¶</a></h4>
<p>Apparently removing all redundancies, synonims, etc from the English language leaves us only with 850 words or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this simplified language Basic English, the developer is Charles K. Ogden, and was released in 1930 with the book: Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar. He founded the Orthological Institute to develop the tools for teaching Basic English. His most famous associate, I.A. Richards, led the effort in the Orient, which uses the techniques to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting bit is, that change doesn't affect the grammar, so one could learn only 850 words and yet converse in English by using its grammar to its full extent.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="brick-pencil"><a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Brick pencil</a> <a href="#brick-pencil">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>, one of the people behind the creation of a computer mouse, and then graphical interfaces, argued about interfaces in his paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: a Conceptual Framework" in 1962 and to proof his point came up with a brick pencil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/images/augment-3906/fig2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>(and now users complain that they have to click a button twice; such a shame)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cosmic-latte"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte">Cosmic Latte</a> <a href="#cosmic-latte">¶</a></h4>
<p>Wikipedia sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cosmic latte is the average colour of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those keen on putting this into their apps, here is the colour: #FFF8E7.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="7-up's-history"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up#History">7-UP's history</a> <a href="#7-up's-history">¶</a></h4>
<p>In my childhood I used to love 7-UP a lot, mostly because it was nearly transparent hence felt less poisonous comparing to other sodas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably if I were to drink it until 1948 it'd be my favourite drink anyway, but not because of its (lack of) colour.</p>
<p>Also all myths about its name are hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, making it acidic on the pH scale and similar to other drinks of this type. [...]<br>
The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this one makes the most sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Britvic also claims that the name is a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.jthoenes.net/personal-retrospectives/">previous articles</a>&nbsp;I wrote, that when doing your very own Personal Retrospective, it has to be in your personal way. But you may have asked yourself how it can work for you. To give you some ideas, I’ll share the approaches of three different people: Linda Rising, Ilias Bartolini and myself.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/iStock_000021086344XSmall-300x199.jpg" alt="article-image"></p>

<p>A retrospective has to be “tailor made” as Derby and Larsen [<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dlret/agile-retrospectives">1</a>] point out. This is in my opinion even more important for personal retrospectives. They need to fit to your thinking, your needs and your timetable. However, it is good to start with something - and over time adapt it to your own needs. I have done this, and probably everyone doing personal retrospectives is doing it.</p>

<p>So here are three approaches you can derive and mix and match from.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Write, Re-Write and Read Retrospective Notes - Linda Rising</h2>

<p>For Linda Rising[<a href="http://www.lindarising.org/">2</a>], a well-known retrospective facilitator,&nbsp;personal retrospectives are an important tool, to know about herself. She writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The cognitive psychologists tell us that it’s difficult, perhaps impossible, to&nbsp;really know ourselves and why we make the decisions in our lives. Our only&nbsp;hope, it seems to me, is to use some of the same techniques that we use&nbsp;to discover what teams have done well, what they might think about doing
differently, and what still puzzles them :-)!</p></blockquote>

<p>After finishing an activity she thinks she might do again, she will think about that activity and note her thoughts on paper. She usually does this right after finishing the activity while traveling.&nbsp;When she arrives at home, she will type the notes and safe them into a folder called <em>“Retrospective”.</em></p>

<p>__Before she will start doing a similar activity, she will read though the retrospective notes to prepare for it. She noticed, “that&nbsp;many of the lessons learned become internalized over time,&nbsp;but there are always surprises - things we have completely forgotten”.</p>

<p>On activities Linda shares with her husband - like traveling or going to a music workshop - he is joining in to the retrospective. On the way home, they talk about their experience and Linda takes notes of it. Arrived at home, she will send him an e-mail to give him the opportunity to add his comments. When they do a similar activity again, they’ll read the retrospective notes together.</p>

<p>All this writing, re-writing and reading is not without a purpose.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cognitive scientists tell us that writing is important so I always write or&nbsp;sketch first and then type to save. Going through the comments twice also&nbsp;helps with learning – and that’s what it’s all about :-)!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Shared Feedback MindMap - Ilias Bartolini</h2>

<p>Ilias Bartolini[<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/">3</a>], my colleague and&nbsp;coach at ThoughtWorks University[<a href="http://join.thoughtworks.com/graduates">4</a>],&nbsp;has an approach centered around a mind map. He started with his self-review in the beginning of 2012, with a small mind map. He collected the data of what happened in 2011 both for work and life related aspects. The mind map grew and evolved over a couple of weeks - having the mind map always open on his laptop and capturing any important thought, when it came to Ilias' mind.</p>

<p>An important part of this mind map is the feedback Ilias received from friends and colleagues. But then he moved one step further: He shared the result of his personal retrospectives with the people who gave him feedback. Seeing their feedback was&nbsp;recognised encouraged them to give more feedback to Ilias. They supported him in his efforts to change himself and gave input how he can implement the feedback they gave.</p>

<p>In his blog series about his approach to self-reviews ([<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/01/30/a-feedback-based-review-why-part1/">5</a>], [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/01/31/a-feedback-based-review-how-part2/">6</a>], [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/02/02/a-feedback-based-personal-review-you-part3/">7</a>] and [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/02/03/a-feedback-based-personal-review-us-part4">8</a>]), Ilias tells us, that this approach helped him to create an&nbsp;epiphany of what happened in his year 2011. Doing the self-review gave him self-confidence and helped him to improve his effectiveness. Most of it, because he started to understand what really matters at his work and at his life.</p>

<p>He internalized this approach so much, that he is constantly applying it. Recently, he put parts of his mind map onto a whiteboard and asked his colleagues to give their comments to it. Here is what he got:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF20581.jpg"><img src="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF20581.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Currently Ilias is&nbsp;perpetually&nbsp;changing his feedback mind map. When he receives new feedback, he will update the mind map. This is his way, to keep track in which areas he needs to work on himself. But more important, it gives him confidence by clearly documenting what he already has&nbsp;archived.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find going back to the mind map summary very useful in many more situations!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Building on top of Retrospective Practices - my own approach</h2>

<p>In 2008 I listen to the excellent Software Radio Episode 105
“Retrospective with Linda Rising”[<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2008/07/episode-105-retrospectives-with-linda-rising/">9</a>]. I was excited about potential
retrospectives could unveil inside a team. But at this time, I was a
student and had no team were a retrospective could be hold. However,
in the beginning of the episode, Linda told that she believed,
everyone should have a retrospective of their own. It sunk
into my brain and stayed there unused for a while.</p>

<p>In mid 2009 I graduated and got my first programming job. I started to
work, moved to a new city and met new people. All was going as
planned. But I was not clear about what my next goal in life would be.
Up until this point, my whole life was working towards this very
point. But what to do next?</p>

<p>This became clear to me shortly before christmas, as I told
it to my father. Telling it someone, made something explicit to
myself. But I suppose it has been in me quite a bit earlier.
Consequently, I decided to do a year-end retrospective for 2009.</p>

<p>I bought some nice food, drinks paper and coloured crayons and blocked
4 hours in my calendar on a Sunday afternoon. Then I created a
timetable of the retrospective practices I wanted to do</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a timeline of the year 2009 and then make your feeling towards the&nbsp;events visible with colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make notes and later write an essay about: ‘What works well’, ‘what to&nbsp;do differently’, ‘What did I learn and what puzzles me’</p></li>
<li><p>Make a mindmap of the result of the retrospective.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I executed the plan - and was very delighted with the outcome. It
really helped me to see things in my life, I did not notice before. On
this day, I started to understand more about myself - and I did set
goals for myself and selected action items to reach these
goals.</p>

<p>One action item was to make personal retrospectives a ritual every
three month. Six month later, during one of these
quarter-retrospectives, I decided to do a heartbeat retrospective
every week. I have adapted the way I do retrospectives and the scheme
of having them since. I’ll write about this in a different article.</p>

<h2>There are more possibilities</h2>

<p>There are&nbsp;hundreds&nbsp;of more ways to do personal&nbsp;retrospectives. I’ve talked to someone, who travels home by train for one hour every day. Instead of reading or listening she spends the time reflecting about her day - having a retrospective every day.</p>

<p>Aisley Nies[<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Personal-Retrospectives">9</a>] takes some time around her birthday every year and travels somewhere. She gets “away from everything” and spends some time thinking about herself.</p>

<p>You can also read the retrospective reports from Aimee Daniells [<a href="http://sermoa.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/aimees-2011-retrospective-a-year-in-review/">10</a>] and Mark Neeham [<a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/01/03/my-software-development-journey-2011/">11</a>] on their blogs. This gives you a hint, how they did their own personal retrospectives for the year 2011.</p>

<h2>What about you?</h2>

<p>Have you started or scheduled your own personal retrospectives?&nbsp;How will you make personal retrospectives work for yourself? What hinders you to start?</p>

<p>Please leave a comment or blog about it and drop me a link. I’m very&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in the different approaches.</p>

<p><em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> has given rise to a new generation of chess enthusiasts. <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/"><em>How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</em></a>’s traffic quadrupled between October and November 2020, and Lichess traffic <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">jumped 10%</a> in that same span. To all the new and reengaged chess players, welcome!</p>
<p>As part of this surge of interest, many new players have sent me questions and comments on openings. What opening do I choose? Is the reason I lose because I don’t want to memorize as many openings as my opponents? What do you think about [insert opening here]?</p>
<p>Here’s my thesis:</p>
<p><em>The best opening for rapid chess improvement is the one that gets you to a comfortable middlegame position with as little work as possible<sup>1</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article lays out specific, concrete openings that I’ve selected for you. They require minimal study, work against a variety of responses from your opponent, and naturally flow to comfortable middlegame positions. These are well-established, sound openings that my students have seen success with, and there are multiple openings you can choose from to suit your own chess preferences and tastes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that you understand the basic opening principles of developing your pieces, controlling the center, getting your king safe (usually via castling), and connecting the rooks. <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/opening-principles">Chess.com’s interactive primer</a> looks good if you’re not familiar with them or need a refresher. It’s also helpful to be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this post is designed to help you improve without a coach, I’m taking on a few students to coach within this structure to help accelerate their improvement. If that’s something you’re interested in, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ef9ffebeafff3def9ffebeafff3f0ffecebf2ffb0fdf1f3">gautam[at]gautamnarula.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Openings for White</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, I quickly recommended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">The London System</a> and moved on without elaborating much further. I’m going to go a little more in-depth about the London here, as well as offer other options (including a 1.e4 option!) for players who don’t enjoy the types of positions that emerge from the London.</p>
<p><strong><u>Opening for 1. d4 players: The London System or the Colle-Zukertort</u></strong></p>
<p>The London System features the moves 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. Bf4, 4. e3, followed by c3, Bd3, Nbd2 and O-O in the appropriate order depending on the opponent’s moves (Diagram 1). It has been <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1813667">deployed</a> by none other than World Champion Magnus Carlsen! It’s so difficult for Black to stop you from achieving this basic setup that it’s not necessary to write out sample lines like I do for the e4 opening below.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 1: </strong>The ideal London System setup.</p>
<p>A cousin of the London system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_System">Colle</a>, where the pawn is pushed to e3 before the c1 bishop has moved, blocking it in. The <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1025949">Colle-Zukertort</a> is an improvement on the Colle where that bishop is fianchettoed on the queenside, and can lead to some more interesting positions than the London in my experience (Diagram 2).</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 2: </strong>The ideal Colle-Zukertort setup. Notice that compared to the London System, the f4 bishop is now on b2 and the c3 pawn push has been replaced with the b3 pawn push.</p>
<p>One example Colle-Zukertort line:</p>

<p>Some ideas for White here: placing a rook on c1 and pushing for central expansion with c2-c4, or placing a knight on e5 followed by a f2-f4 push and a potential kingside attack.</p>
<p><b><u>Opening for 1. e4 players: The King’s Indian Attack</u></b></p>
<p>1. e4 openings are inherently more difficult to play than d4 openings<sup>3</sup>, so we’ll have to spend a little more time learning my pick, the King’s Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA has a storied history, with <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008365">many stunning victories coming from a young Bobby Fischer</a> in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. It’s basically the King’s Indian Defense (which is, more or less, my recommendation as Black) with colors reversed, and the extra tempo from playing as White gives you the flexibility to play it against just about anything.</p>
<p>The KIA setup involves the moves e4, d3, Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, typically resulting in the structure in Diagram 3.<span><!-- [if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p><b>Diagram 3:</b> Standard KIA setup.</p>
<p>White’s king is castled and safe, and White exerts control of the center with the two pawns and knights. White’s main plan is a well-timed e4-e5 pawn push, accompanied with gaining space and potentially aiming for a kingside attack (those acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Closed_Sicilian">Closed Sicilian</a> will find these kinds of positions familiar). The main challenge is to figure out how to develop the c1 bishop efficiently.</p>
<p>Below are a few sample lines of what you might face:</p>
<p><b>1…e5 (King’s Pawn Game)</b></p>

<p><b>1…c5 <strong>(Sicilian Defense)</strong></b></p>

<p><strong>1…e6 (French Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…d5 (Scandinavian Defense)</strong></p>
<p>The Scandinavian used to be a great surprise opening and rare enough that in years past I wouldn’t have included it here, but thanks to the valiant efforts of IM John Bartholomew and #teamscandi it’s become pretty popular at the amateur level (and I’ve been recommending a Scandi variant to my students for over a decade as well, so naturally my massive influence has popularized it and shifted the frontiers of chess at both the amateur and professional levels). Unfortunately, you can’t go into a standard KIA structure (1. e4 d5 2. d3 dxe4 3.dxe4 Qxe1+ 4. Kxe1 and clearly this is a very different kind of game).</p>
<p>So instead, my suggestion is to exchange the pawns and bring the knight to c3 followed by the KIA style fianchetto.</p>
<p> You can do the same against 3…Qd6, which I recommend for Black below. White has a flexible and comfortable position and aim to exert more central control with Rf1-e1 and potentially maneuvering one of the knights to e4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Opening for 1. c4 Players: Read a Book</strong></span></p>
<p>I said it in How to Get Good at Chess, Fast and I’ll say it again: you’re on your own. Being a hipster has its costs. Truth hurts! I’ve heard good things about <a href="https://amzn.to/38xREcp">Starting Out: The English</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Openings for Black</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, for Black I recommended a kingside fianchetto setup involving the moves Nf6, g6, d6, Bg7, and O-O (Diagram 4). I’ll elaborate on that here. I also offer an alternative option, the Qd6 Scandinavian + …g6 Slav, for those who prefer to contest for central control right away rather than let White immediately build up a center.</p>
<p><strong><u>Kingside Fianchetto</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Diagram 4: </strong>The basic kingside fianchetto structure.</p>
<p>The idea behind this structure is its flexibility. You can strike in the center with …e5 and …Nc6, potentially following up with a kingside attack. You can play more on the queenside with …Nbd7 and …c5, potentially transposing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence">Sicilian</a> line.</p>
<p>Experienced players might point out that this could lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defense">King’s Indian Defense</a> (KID) or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_defense">Pirc Defense</a>, which turn out to be rather complicated openings. This is true, but you can play both these openings with little theoretical knowledge up to the 1600 level and still be fine. The main idea you need to be aware of is avoiding getting overrun in the center with a well timed …e5 or …c5 push if white is building up a central pawn phalanx. Here are a few sample lines which show this idea.</p>
<p>The King’s Indian Defense:</p>
 <p><span>Notice Black plays 4…d6 rather than castling first, makes it more uncomfortable for white to kick the knight around with 5. e5 (5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Nxd1 Ne4 is much more comfortable for Black). Black also plays 6…e5 to strike back at the center. If White plays 7.d5, Black has the logical move 7… Nbd7 with the goal of trying to secure the c5 square for the knight.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the main line of the KID, and I included it here so you can see the ideas in action – White has the option of building up a strong center against the fianchetto system<sup>2</sup> and Black <em>must</em> counterstrike in the center to avoid an uncomfortable and inferior position. On the flipside, White has to watch out for the fianchettoed g7 bishop – many games are decided by tactics against a rook on a1 or a knight on c3. </span></p>
<p>For e4, we have the Pirc Defense:</p>
<p> Similar ideas here: strike back at the center ..c5 or …e5 at the appropriate moment. A related idea is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_(chess)">Hedgehog structure</a>, which is also surprisingly resilient.</p>
<p>You may also want to review opposite side castling attacks, which could happen if White decides to castle queenside instead. These games are a lot of fun but can get a bit crazy!</p>
<p><strong><u>The g6 Slav + Qd6 Scandinavian</u></strong></p>
<p>Some of my student’s have seen great results with kingside fianchetto structures, but I’ll admit these structures can result in games that are a bit intense. This is a quieter alternative that’s still easy to learn and leads to interesting positions.</p>
<p>Against d4, my recommendation is the g6 Slav (my engine tells me this is called the Schlechter Variation), which almost always will go 1…d5 2…c6 3….Nf7 4…g6, typically with …Bg7 and …O-O to follow <strong>(Diagram 5)</strong></p>

<p>A variant of this plan is for White is to pressure d5 with Qb3 and Bg5 to force Black to play e6 and lock in the c8 bishop:</p>

<p>Black gets a flexible position and, by not committing a pawn to e6 early like in other similar openings (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense">Semi-Slav</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence">French</a>), leaves the possibility open in non-Qb3 variations for developing the c8 bishop to a good square and only then playing e6 to support the d5 focal point in the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against e4, my recommendation is the Qd6 Scandinavian, which begins with 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 (Diagram 6).</p>

<p>The Qd6 Scandinavian can look a bit… odd if you’ve never seen it before.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

    <div>
    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>
    If you're a blogger or anyone who makes things to read on the web, you have a problem. While there are people with the energy and ability to read long pieces, there are often people stuck using phones with resolutions not well suited to reading, or people who lack the attention span to read something longer than a page. Frankly, I have found myself as both of these people due to my reading habits. So how can you expand your audience to people in these predicaments? I'd suggest using NewSprint on your site. NewSprint has a twofold advantage. The former advantage is that it is better for your eyes by advancing text for you so you don't have to move your eyes and by having a large font that can fill the page, as it only needs to display one word at a time. The latter advantage is that because you no longer have to move your eyes or strain to make out words, you can read much faster than you would otherwise. These advantages can make content more welcoming to smaller screens and shorter attention spans, two demographics which are highly represented. Here are some features of NewSprint:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://example.com/">links</a>, which are commonplace in most blogs.</li>
        <li>custom output location(passed in the second argument, if you wish to remove the NewSprint popup via dom manipulation)</li>
        <li>custom css(which can be passed into the nsprint function as a link in the third argument)</li>
        <li>adaptable reading, by utilizing the mozilla readability library</li>
        <li>low filesize, the dropin buttons are only 440 bytes, 246 bytes and 213 bytes(in descending order), the main program is only 3.4k, with a 2.1k stylesheet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You're likely wondering now, how do I implement this? I've prepared some examples with instructions on how to implement them, ranging from simplest to most advanced.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>1) Drop-in with auto-adapt:</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the simplest solution, the drop-in button. With this, all you need to do is include the following code in your site:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script'),c=a.createElement('script');c.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mozilla/readability/Readability.js';b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';c.type='text/javascript';b.onload=a.head.appendChild(c);c.onload=function(){nsprint((new Readability(document.cloneNode(!0))).parse().textContent)};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_aa.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>2) Drop-in with custom text:</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the (second) simplest solution, the drop-in button, with specified text. This method has higher accuracy than the prior model, and is still accessible to people who only work in html:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script');b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';b.onload=function(){nsprint(a.getElementsByClassName('sprtxt'))};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_ct.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>3) Drop-in with plaintext:</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the third solution, the drop-in button, with plaintext from a variable. This method is perhaps the best, however it is third because it requires basic javascript knowledge, additionally, links are in markdown format:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;script&gt;
    var preDefinedText = "changeme [links](https://example.com)";
    &lt;/script&gt;
    
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script');b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';b.onload=function(){nsprint(preDefinedText)};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_pt.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>4) Raw Source:</h2>
    <p>
    The final option is just to take a look at the raw source, which is listed on github:
    </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/JakeTrock/newSprint"><h2>source</h2></a>

And happily, a lot of educators and curious players are sharing our passion. Since our <a href="https://luden.io/" rel="noopener">first released games</a>, we talk to teachers, parents, and therapists on a regular basis. Learning more and more about their needs we understood that we want to find a field where educational video games can serve as a vital daily tool, not as yet another extra material.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png" width="4000" height="2250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>First versions of logos for Rewire</figcaption></figure><p id="149d">Several educators approached us at different times, suggesting that we should develop a game for players with learning differences. This is when we’ve teamed up with a clinical psychologist friend of ours and started drafting what later became <a href="https://rewire.education/" rel="noopener">Rewire.Education</a> — an interactive course for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and related disabilities.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/846/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png" width="423" height="298" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/846/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png 423w" sizes="423px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Number of lessons conducted every week since September 2018</figcaption></figure><p id="18a1">This project took us onto a 2-years journey and resulted in a bunch of researches, a dragon, thousands of lessons, a couple of VR games, a browser adventure, an app for certified specialists, and finally a simulation game about emotions and communication that we’re working on right now (and you are invited to play the early friends-and-family version of the game — <a href="https://ludenio.substack.com/about" rel="noopener">sign up here</a>).</p><p id="8ccc">At the beginning none of us knew much about autism. We did know, however, that autistic learners have troubles generalizing social skills and maintaining attention during classes, so VR was a good option to start with. It was also kinda personal: our previous educational VR games received lots of positive feedback, but they were one-time tools, and we wanted to create an educational game that could be applied on a regular basis.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Distraction-free room made in Unreal Engine 4 for Oculus Go VR headset</figcaption></figure><p id="1345">Our therapist friend had little experience of working with autistic people, but she did help us connect to a private school York, which specialized in working with learners with ASD. Shortly before approaching them, we assembled a prototype of a <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">sorting exercise in VR</a> using Unreal Engine 4 made by Epic Games and Oculus Go headset, which was pretty much as far as our understanding of education for autistic people went at the moment.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1848/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg" width="924" height="577" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Presenting the very first version at the educational conference in Atlanta, GA</figcaption></figure><p id="168f">It quickly turned out, however, that there was nothing about sorting exercises in real life, that could be improved with virtual reality. On the other hand, educators were struggling with generalization of skills in the context of social situations, such as going to a mall or visiting a dentist. They suggested that we should start by developing an exercise for establishing and maintaining eye contact. But by the time we finished working on this exercise, the school had stopped answering our emails, so we didn’t have a chance to test it in action. Perhaps they didn’t see any use for what we were doing in their work, but we’ve decided to not give up and move on.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7680/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c36a">A new exciting page of Rewire’s history began when we brought <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">this prototype</a> to “Our Sunny World”, one of the biggest educational institutions for people with autism and related disorders in Russia. Since we were in the same city, it was possible for us to iterate together on a regular basis, and the specialists from “Our Sunny World” quickly proved very interested in experimenting with the new media, and full of ideas.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>You can download ABA VR here <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635</a></figcaption></figure><p id="4bd7">We were attending about 5–10 classes per week, assisting the therapists while they were helping their learners interact with an Oculus Go headset. Through the summer of 2019, we have developed together several new exercises for our VR simulation, directly based on the tools that therapists were using in their work. Our hypothesis was that virtual reality would cut off all possible distractions, while simultaneously making it easier for a learner to go through trials and errors, due to the “playful” and “unreal” nature of the process. In other words, we supposed that the children would be less discouraged by their mistakes if they happened in VR.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/46/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ae30">These experiments brought us to many interesting results and little breakthroughs (you can read about it in detail <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/rewire-education-3-stories-from-teachers-who-made-video-games-for-autistic-students-63783dfd7fc">here</a>). One particularly interesting case occurred later in winter 2020 when we conducted a 2-months long <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/vr-experiment-children-with-asd-spatial-category-training-f05aa51da142">experiment</a> in trying to learn new skills using VR simulation.

Through the fall of 2019 we have been <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/rewire-vr-lessons-open-mind-school-experience-b284efe293c9">showing</a> Rewire.Education to many teachers and therapists in the US, and our work did not exactly turn to be a silver bullet for them. VR headsets were not too easy to handle for an average teacher, nor they were affordable and ubiquitous. VR part of Rewire required a very enthusiastic and progressive educator to persuade their superiors to adapt to their school. Needless to say, such educators are a very rare breed. Besides, when it came to social situations, there already existed an amazing project called <a href="https://floreotech.com/" rel="noopener">Floreo</a>, which offers out of the box VR solutions for iPads and iPhones. We sincerely recommend it to anyone interested in applying VR to autism education.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif" width="480" height="270" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif 480w" sizes="480px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b92d">But the thing we were really after was an understanding of where we could apply our expertise in video games to help the educators improve the lives of people with ASD. The answer to this riddle was looming in front of us, but we were unable to grasp it just yet. At the same time, we were experimenting with VR, another educator from “Our Sunny World” came up with an idea of a cooperative game that would help explain the importance of cooperation with other people.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ceb8">This is how we created <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/ta/481537" rel="noopener"><strong>Rewire Teamwork Adventure</strong></a>, a little browser story about two heroes, joining their effort on a quest to defeat an evil dragon. While working on this game, we were also very much inspired by the work of our friends and <a href="https://gametogrow.org/" rel="noopener">Game to Grow</a>, who are adapting D&amp;D tabletop RPG system for therapy and teaching communication.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2018/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif" width="1009" height="570" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e782">We have <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/teamwork-adventure-game-for-children-with-asd-48739db1318c">playtested</a> Teamwork Adventure with some autistic children under 10 years old and saw very interesting happenings in the process. All that brought us to the general idea, that the direction in which we should be heading is <em>communication</em>. But before we headed this way, we had stumbled upon a very peculiar side quest.</p><p id="47cf">By December 2019, we have spent many hours talking to educators who work with autistic students. We have mostly been focusing on specialists working in the field of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), as this approach was scientifically proven to be effective and its methods were structured enough for our IT brains to comprehend.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="294a">While talking to many ABA professionals, we have noticed that virtually all of them were struggling with flashcards. These cards were piled up in the cabinets, they would occupy the whole trunk of one therapist’s car, and therapists would spend hours each week, searching for, printing, laminating, sorting, and resorting those cards. After researching, we have found that there were some digital flashcards apps and services on the market, but nothing specifically tailored for the needs of ABA therapists, so we decided to fix that. This is how we’ve created an app with a rather straightforward name: <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener"><strong>ABA Cards</strong></a>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="127c">Our biggest fear was to develop yet another gimmick app, so we have been trying to talk to as many ABA therapists as we could reach and ask them to test the prototype. Needless to say, that teachers are an incredibly busy bunch, so most of them didn’t have time for a call, but we’ve managed to reach several dozens of respondents. Once again, the ABA department in “Our Sunny World” helped us with their feedback, along with many other local ABA centers and therapists.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3576/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png" width="1788" height="1556" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c25d">This way, <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener">ABA Cards</a> effectively included exercises that therapists have specifically asked us to design for their work. For our first prototype, we have developed a selection of lessons based on the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_Behavior_Milestones_Assessment_and_Placement_Program" rel="noopener">VB-Mapp</a> ABA protocol. After another round of interviews, we have added an option to create custom cards and make lessons out of them, along with an advanced data collection tool, based on the therapists’ checklists. We’ve also topped it with remote lessons feature, as by this time it was March 2020, and the infamous COVID-19 lockdown was upon us, and many educators were struggling, not being able to meet their learners face to face, as they usually do. Due to the same circumstances, we’ve made the app free for the period of pandemic.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2848/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png" width="1424" height="1236" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8fb4">After releasing the app in Google Play and AppStore we have <a href="https://youtu.be/STdtG-N2Tjs" rel="noopener">presented</a> it, along with Rewire’s whole story, at <a href="https://www.abainternational.org/welcome.aspx" rel="noopener">ABAI</a> annual conference and went on collecting the feedback, and upgrading the app. Again, our learnings were peculiar, but not too impressive. Less than 10% of users would refer to remote lessons, and overall retention was about 5% by the 30th day. The feedback that we were gathering through Google Forms questionnaire, suggested that we should add more content to the app. We did exactly that, allowing educators to share their decks of cards with colleagues and adding several more popular ABA techniques to the app.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Our talk from ABAI 46th annual convention, 2020</figcaption></figure><p id="2d64">Unfortunately, that didn’t influence retention too much, although by fall 2020 we’ve achieved a number of 3500 lessons per week in <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener">ABA Cards</a>. The funny moment here is that <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener">ABA Cards</a> is growing by itself and 1–2 times a month absolutely unexpectedly for us 100+ therapists singing up in a couple of hours because of someone from their Facebook community start using the app.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3456/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg" width="1728" height="1550" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*KDKmLS7RedkYz55grMpj6A.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>This message was sent by one of the non-verbal kids on the spectrum who demonstrated amazing progress during lessons with Rewire.</figcaption></figure><p id="c3c9">Perhaps, partly it was due to the overall rhythm of the medium: educators, …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py36 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>82</span><span> seconds

✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py39 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>461</span><span> seconds
</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2
interpreter open, right?</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># Convert the characters in the hostname to hexadecimal.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>hostname </span><span>= </span><span>"node.example.com"

</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># Convert the "IP address" to text.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>address </span><span>= </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(hostname)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>str</span><span>(address)
</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;

</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># Compare the results and see they're equal.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>hostname_as_hexadecimal </span><span>== </span><span>address_without_colons
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:
    </span><span>self._check_packed_address(address, </span><span>16</span><span>)
    </span><span>bvs </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_bytes_to_byte_vals(address)
    self</span><span>._ip </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_int_from_byte_vals(bvs, </span><span>'big'</span><span>)
    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3><p>Newsletter directories sole purpose is to help people find the best newsletters to read in any category they're interested in. Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter. The more eyes your newsletter is in front of the more you'll grow.</p><h3 id="passive-growth">Passive Growth</h3><p>One of the most interesting benefits of submitting your newsletter to a directory is the passive growth you'll receive. Do the work of submitting your newsletter once, get passive subscribe growth forever. Every weekly you'll slowly grow from this channel without needing to think twice.</p><p>Nick Frost from <a href="https://www.newsletters.co/">Newsletters.co</a> and <a href="https://inboxstash.com/">InboxStash</a> says to expect about 10-20 new subscribers the first week you submit to a newsletter directory. Also a newsletter directories authority grows, growth picks up for all newsletters.

<p>Wasmino is an Arduino core fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. It allows you to compile your Arduino sketch to WebAssembly and run it in a browser, all using the Arduino IDE.</p>



<h2>Showcase</h2>



<p>This is the off-the-shelf “Fade” example in the Arduino IDE.</p>


<pre title="">/*
  Fade

  This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite()
  function.

  The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're
  using, be sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins
  are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

  This example code is in the public domain.

  http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade
*/

int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // set the brightness of pin 9:
  analogWrite(led, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness &lt;= 0 || brightness &gt;= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
  delay(30);
}
</pre>


<p>You can see it compiled to WASM and running here:</p>



<p>(<strong>Click the “Run” button</strong> and the LED should start to animate)</p>



<p><a href="https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D">https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D</a></p>



<h2>Setting it up</h2>



<p>Disclaimer: The toolchain is only tested on Windows (x86-64) and Linux (x86-64), and probably will work for MacOS. It 100% won’t work on 32bit systems since some dependencies (WASI and Binaryen) are 64bit only.</p>



<p>You’ll need your Arduino IDE installed first.</p>



<p>Go to File -&gt; Preferences, and add <a href="https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json">https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json</a> to “Additional Boards Manager URLs”.</p>

<p>Install “Wasmino Virtual Boards” in Tools -&gt; Board -&gt; Board Manager. Select Wasmino as as target board.</p>



<p>Write some Arduino code, click upload, and an URL will be generated for you. (If you are uploading for the first time, it will ask you to login to your GitHub account. It uses GitHub Gist for saving the compiled WASM binary. The login times out in 60 seconds.)</p>

<p>Paste that URL into your browser and use the UI to add LEDs or toggle switches. The URL will automatically update as you make changes. You can then copy the resulting URL in the browser and share it with other people.</p>



<h2>Caveats</h2>



<p>The Wasmino should be viewed as having an infinitely fast CPU, and operations other than <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code> do not take any CPU time. Calling time functions <code>micros</code> and <code>millis</code> should reflect this. IO can only happen during sleep, therefore you cannot do</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {} // this will hang the browser tab
</pre>


<p>and should do this instead</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {
    delay(50);
}
</pre>


<p>Having a infinitely fast CPU also means that interrupts will only happen during <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code>. It is still good practice to use <code>noInterrupts</code> and <code>interrupts</code> to protect critical sections if you plan to use your code on real hardware.</p>



<p>Other caveats exist such as the lack of <code>BUILTIN_LED</code> macro since Wasmino, being virtual, doesn’t have a built-in LED.</p>

        <section>
            <div><p>I'm <em>still in the game</em>, so join me as I explore the highlights of a second year of independent business and creating Open Source software. I'll share my top blog posts by views, top interviews, books that have influenced me and a little about each project I maintain. At the end of the post I'll talk about what 2021 has in store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a lot of help this year, so I want to thank all my company's customers, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">my GitHub Sponsors</a>, and everyone who contributed or helped to share.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mostpopularblogpostsof2020">Most popular blog posts of 2020</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've focused on developing the OpenFaaS and inlets brands, and I've also experimented with Medium's Partner Program. These are the four blogs where you would have seen me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfaas.com/blog">openfaas.com/blog</a> - OpenFaaS tutorials and news</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog">inlets.dev/blog</a> - case-studies, tutorials and news on inlets</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">blog.alexellis.io</a> - my original blog for experiments, technical writing, tutorials that don't fit with one of the other brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexellisuk">medium.com/@alexellisuk</a> - blog posts that I think can be monetized</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been encouraging to see my posts trending on Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter, along with being included in newsletters like <a href="https://kubeweekly.io/">KubeWeekly</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/">cron.weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the most popular blog posts from the year ranked by views:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/five-years-of-raspberry-pi-clusters-77e56e547875">Five years of Raspberry Pi Clusters (2020)</a> (Medium.com)</li>
<li><a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/then-he-asked-me-is-kubernetes-right-for-us-78695ee35289">Then he asked me “Is Kubernetes right for us?” (2020)</a> (Medium.com)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/">Golang basics - writing unit tests (2017)</a> (alexellis.io)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/">Will it cluster? k3s on your Raspberry Pi (2019)</a> (alexellis.io)</li>
</ul>
<p>From openfaas/inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/puppeteer-scraping/">Web scraping that just works with OpenFaaS with Puppeteer (2020)</a> (OpenFaaS.com)</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/12/15/multi-cluster-monitoring.html">How to monitor multi-cloud Kubernetes with Prometheus and Grafana (2020)</a> (inlets.dev)</li>
</ul>
<p>I now have hundreds of blog posts going back several years, so it's difficult to read too much into the numbers, as it depends on how much traffic the site gets and where it has trended. A post on Hacker News could get 15k views overnight, and another more impactful post could get a steady stream of 3k per day from organic searches.</p>
<p>This year I've mainly focused on use-cases, and on capturing the imagination. In 2021, you'll see more of the same along with more guest posts on the blogs.</p>
<h2 id="bestinterviewsfeatures">Best interviews / features</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/readme">GitHub's readme program</a>, I was invited to write a feature-length piece on independent business and Open Source development</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readme/alex-ellis">Balancing open source sacrifice and success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you a deeper perspective on what it's like to be on the hook for a large OSS project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/craigbox?lang=en">Craig Box</a> from Google reached out to me and asked me: "Why aren't you working for a FAANG company for 350K USD / year"?</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Craig had sketched out a brief history of my career in a Google Doc, and we were recording a podcast with his co-host</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Kubernetes Podcast #116 - Independent Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how a developer at a payroll company became a Docker Captain, caused a stir with a prototype, and quit his job to create an independent software business.</p>
<h2 id="influentialreads">Influential reads</h2>
<p>I've read a number of books this year that have had an influence on me. I can't say that I finished them all, but I did get something from each that has helped me with my journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf">Don't just roll the dice</a> - a short guide to software pricing by Neil Davidson - this book taught me about the "pricing curve" - and how once a price rises above 0USD (think open source), you lose part of your potential market. There is a sweet spot on the curve. It also taught me about "price anchoring" - where a similar product becomes the way people expect your offering to be priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoCFpb">Before The Exit: Thought Experiments For Entrepreneurs by Dan Andrews</a> - this book showed me that a product or project gives a platform and outlet, that once taken away can leave a void. It also challenged the idea that selling a business is the only successful outcome. And that receiving a windfall of cash, isn't necessarily as fulfilling as we would hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38H5okY">The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients by David A. Fields</a> - the main learning in this book is that success is found not in selling what you think you are able to, but in finding what pain a customer might have, and offering a solution that could help. Likewise, they need to sense urgency and enough pain to buy the solution. It also has to be simple enough to make sense to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example of this would be Tailwind UI - a series of HTML and CSS snippets built by a designer and marketed to developers. Most backend developers are hopeless at making things look nice on a webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oaFQU5">The Visual MBA by Jason Barron</a> - having spent so much of my life giving all of the value I was creating away for free, this book helped me understand a framework for testing business ideas and iterating on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, from a business and sustainability perspective, Open Source software fails its creators and only benefits its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoG0Vd">Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a> - the premise of this book was enough for me to stop and question things. When you're responsible for picking what you're working on, then asking Why? becomes even more important. Why did I start OpenFaaS? Why am I still working on it?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a why and challenging it over time could save us all a lot of wasted time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common theme in all of these books was that customers buy ways to reduce and remove pain. It needn't be a 10x improvement, but it should be an obvious solution, and they need to have a sense urgency about fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I would also say that I've become more aware of "Indie Hackers" - these are solo developers who come up with what's usually a very trivial idea, but execute on it hard. One example that caught my attention was a service that just <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">makes banner images for blog posts</a>. That was it. That was the product. From the outside, it looks like a simple idea that is easily copied, but by pressing in, he is now earning 8k USD per month from a platform, which I imagine costs very little to run.</p>
<p>When I compare this to my journey with OpenFaaS, and consider that its <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">recurring revenue on GitHub Sponsors</a> is only around 500 USD / mo, from one end-user company, it makes me question the ideology of Open Source Software.</p>
<h2 id="projecthighlights">Project highlights</h2>
<h3 id="inletscloudnativetunnels">inlets - Cloud Native tunnels</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>inlets was created to make tunnels something we could self-host, to get away from the limitations of SaaS products, and to integrate deeply with VMs, containers and Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year I launched a landing page and blog for <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a>. To begin with it was just a few pieces of Tailwind UI tied together that showed pricing and features. It was a starting-point, but then over time it's evolved and now even has its own blog with guest posts.</p>
<p>Highlights for inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inlets blog launched - the first post was about my inlets presentation on <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/08/advanced-cloud-patterns.html">"Advanced cloud patterns" at cert-manager's community day</a>. Since then I've seen several guest posts and an uptick in visits to the domain because of SEO and social sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business customers - inlets PRO has seen lots of customer interest over the year, and had its first business customers. I've got used to qualifying leads, following-up on free trials and more used to rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a>/<a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> providers - both gained new cloud providers like Hetzner, Azure and Vultr. I couldn't have done this without the support of the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/tag/0.7.0">inlets OSS + PRO syntax</a> - both were quite different and are now almost identical to help with adoption and to make it more intuitive for new users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal customers - some customers feel the price is fair, others expect it to be free. This is just the pricing curve doing its thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most personal customers are choosing inlets PRO to enable their local development, self-hosting needs or to get <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/self-hosting-kubernetes-on-your-raspberry-pi/">Ingress into their homelabs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It only takes a few seconds to create a tunnel server with inletsctl, but next year, if there's enough interest then I may look into building a managed inlets service.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="openfaasserverlessfunctionsmadesimple">OpenFaaS - Serverless Functions Made Simple</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My top highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> adoption and reception</li>
<li>Writing <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introduction-to-serverless-linuxfoundation/">Introduction to Serverless Kubernetes for the LinuxFoundation</a></li>
<li>Going fully multi-arch for all OpenFaaS projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/">Moving the templates to multi-arch with buildx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/birthday-invite/">Celebrating the 4th Birthday with the community</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For OpenFaaS my highlight would be <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>. faasd was initially an experiment to see if <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> would make a good back-end for functions instead of Kubernetes. By removing the support for clusters which have natural latency through their event-drive nature, things like cold-starts got so rapid, that they stopped existing. The cost to run OpenFaaS dropped from "a Kubernetes cluster" to a 3 EUR / mo VPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're still only scratching the surface of what faasd will mean for the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You end up with something that costs less than cloud functions, and has a much better developer experience, with the ability to "scale-up" into Kubernetes in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnZJXI377ak">Meet faasd. Look Ma’ No Kubernetes!</a> - a 10 minute video overview of the use-case, the differences, and how people are using it in production already.</li>
</ul>
<p>See it in action in this community blog post: <a href="https://myedes.io/stripe-serverless-webhook-faasd/">Tracking Stripe Payments with Slack and faasd</a></p>
<h3 id="arkadeportablekubernetesmarketplace">arkade - portable Kubernetes marketplace</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a></li>
</ul>
<p>arkade now has 40 apps that you can install with one command, and dozens of CLIs that you can install much quicker than using brew or apt-get. This year I've seen around half a dozen projects copy the approach arkade uses to fetch binaries, so I think we're on to something there.</p>
<p>Its real value comes in compounding - when you need several CLIs or Apps for a tutorial or cluster, the speed-up in getting something deployed is huge.</p>
<p>Want self-hosted OpenFaaS, with a public IP and TLS certificate, but running on your laptop, with KinD?</p>
<pre><code># Get your CLIs
arkade get kind
arkade get kubectl
arkade get faas-cli

# Create that cluster
kind create cluster

# Deploy inlets-operator to get a public IP for your IngressController
arkade install inlets-operator \
  --token-file $HOME/digitalocean-token \
  --region lon1 \
  --license-from …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

<![CDATA[Virtualize Your Network on FreeBSD with VNET]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<div>
<h2><strong>FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.</strong></h2>



<p>VIMAGE was first presented in the Paper <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/zec-vimage/">“Implementing a Clonable Network Stack in the FreeBSD Kernel” by Macro Zec in 2003</a> and VIMAGE code appeared first in FreeBSD 8.0, however it wasn’t until FreeBSD 12.0 that VIMAGE was built into FreeBSD GENERIC kernels and it is a bit of an overlooked feature.</p>



<p>If you have used jails before you might wonder what more VNET jails offer or why you would want to migrate from using localhost-based networking. VNET jails give each jail its own isolated copy of the network stack. They get everything from the IP layer up, creating a network stack that is entirely its own, almost anything you could do with a distinct host you can do with a jail and VNET.</p>



<p>VNET network stacks can be given interfaces from the host and once an interface has been delegated into a VNET jail it disappears from the view of the host, becoming only visible in the jail. FreeBSD offers the epair interface that acts as a virtual Ethernet cable. Give one end of an epair to a VNET jail and keep the other end in the host and you have a way to network between the host and the jail or even between multiple jails. Unlike normal jail networking a VNET jail is able to fully use the interface and once given the correct permissions it can perform packet captures and traces as if it were a full host.</p>



<p>VNET allows jails to be closer to full virtual machines with much less overhead and they offer the ability to test networking in isolation with a very similar environment to the jail host.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET with a jail</strong></h4>



<p>The best way to experiment with VNET is to create some test jails and play with their networks. With VNET it is easy and cheap to create a new separate network that will not interfere with the hosts configuration.</p>



<p>First to demonstrate the power the VNET provides we will create a simple jail that only isolates networking from the host. If we run the following three commands on a FreeBSD system we can create a simple jail:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=emptyjail persist vnet
    host # jexec emptyjail /bin/sh
    emptyjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
    options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
    groups: lo

<p>The important flags to the jail command here are <em>persist</em> and <em>vnet</em>, <em>persist</em> keeps the jail around even though nothing is running inside of it, <em>vnet</em> creates the jail with its own VIMAGE network stack.</p>



<p>The jail we have created contains a loop back interface (lo0) but cannot see any of the interfaces from the host, it has been isolated at the network and process level. Because we do not specify a new root to use for the jails file system, it can see everything on the host file system as before, this can be really handy when you are developing and running tests that take advantage of VNET.</p>



<p>For our jail to be useful we need to be able to access network interfaces, VNET jails can be given any interface and once given to a jail they vanish from the view of the host network stack. When we want to network between the host and the jail we can use an epair(4) device. epair devices are a pair of Ethernet-like interfaces connected back to back, sort of like an emulated patch cable. Each side is denoted with a letter, they come as an ‘a’ and a ‘b’ part. If we create an epair and move one half into the jail, once it is configured we can communicate from the host to the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # ja    host # ifconfig epair create
    epair0a
    host # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384

            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0a
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair

            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>This time when we create our jail we delegate one half of the epair to it. We need to configure the interface in the jail and on the host. Once we have the interfaces configured we can communicate between the host and jail (Note: when you delegate an interface to a jail all the configuration will be erased. You must configure the interface once it is inside the jail).</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=networkjail persist vnet vnet.interface=epair0b 
    host # jexec networkjail /bin/sh

    networkjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    networkjail # ifconfig epair0b inet 192.0.2.2/24 up     
    networkjail # exit

    host # ifconfig epair0a inet 192.0.2.1/24 up
    host # ping 192.0.2.2

</code></pre>



<p>Python3 is installed on the host and as our jail doesn’t isolate the file system, all installed software is also available to the jail. We can use the http server built in to python3 to demonstrate a simple network service running inside the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # jexec networkjail sh -c "cd /usr/src; python3 -m http.server" 
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>



<p>With this a web browser on the host machine can be pointed at 192.0.2.2:8000 and we can browse around the structure of the FreeBSD source tree that lives in /usr/src. We can run any service that will run on a FreeBSD host from within this VNET jail. The difference here between older jail networking is that we can do anything with the epair that we could do with a real network interface such as place add it to a bridge.</p>



<p>When we remove networkjail the half of the epair that was delegated is returned to the host:</p>



<pre><code>    host # ifconfig epair0b
    ifconfig: interface epair0b does not exist
    host # jls -v
       JID  Hostname                      Path
            Name                          State
            CPUSetID
            IP Address(es)
         1                                /
            networkjail                   ACTIVE
            3
    host # jail -r networkjail
    host # ifconfig epair0b
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>When we destroy either half of the epair both halves will be removed from the system, even if the side delegated to a jail.</p>



<p>VNET offers a facility for local testing with a network segment that is very similar to a real network. It is possible to perform any action from the host as you would on a non-virtual network interface such as adding it to a bridge or firewalling.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET to isolate networks</strong></h4>



<p>We are not limited to using virtual interfaces when using VNET, but are able to delegate any interface on the host into the VNET. VNET opens up the opportunity to isolate out chunks of networks allowing us to build complex topologies such as soft routers and firewalls.</p>



<p>We can also use the isolation offered by VNET to offer services from a host on a particular interface that might be undesirable or destructive or if the address space that a piece of equipment uses clashes with the network that the host is on.</p>



<p>On this development machine we have network interfaces on two different networks, one is in the development environment and the other lives in the sandbox testing environment. Never can packets go between the two. The sandbox testing network is where virtual machines live, normally these bhyve machines are configured with a tap interface and they join the network via a bridge interface on the host. VNET allows us to do the same thing, but with jails.</p>



<p>Before we start we need to load the kernel modules for epair and bridge on the host, they normally load automatically on the host when you try to use them, but the jail is unable to do this.</p>



<pre><code>    host # kldload if_epair if_bridge</code></pre>



<p>VNET also allows us to give a physical network interface on the development host to a jail and from that jail create further sub VNET jails that are isolated from the hosts network:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=isojail persist vnet vnet.interface=em0 children.max=1</code></pre>

This resource object will be in use very often, computing it from scratch each time will be a huge waste, this can cause our service to be significantly underutilized for no good reason.</p><blockquote><p>This may resemble the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singelton pattern </a>object initializing in a multi-threaded environment (this is a question that is often used in job interviews) –  which one of the threads will load the resource and only once.</p></blockquote><p>When creating the resource object one may check if the static member is not initialized and initialize the member if needed moving on thinking he just successfully cleared this issue.</p><p>Let’s review the following scenario: the service is highly in use in our server, it gets hits in a ratio of 5/sec, the init resource function will run for ~ 5 sec’. The first request comes in and fires the async  ‘getInstance’ function since it is an async request the event loop will now stop the function execution and resume once the async function has been resolved – in our example after 5 seconds.</p><h3><span id="The_resource_code"></span>The resource code<span></span></h3><pre><code>export class Resource {
  static instance;

 constructor(... args) {
  }

  static async getInstance() {
    if (!Resource.instance){ Resource.instance =
      await ResourceFactory.getInstance();}
    else {
      console.log('no need to init resource we have it')
    }
    return Resource.instance;
  }
}

export class ResourceFactory {
  static getInstance(){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=&gt;{
      console.log('init resource')
      setTimeout(()=&gt;{
        console.log('resolving resource');
        resolve(true)
      },5000);
    })
  }
}
</code></pre><p>We can now simulate this scenario  from a user perspective</p><pre><code>let i = 0;
const intervalId = setInterval(async () =&gt; {
  const resource = await Resource.getInstance();
  console.log('resource is init');
  if (i === 50) clearInterval(intervalId);
  i++;

}, 200);
</code></pre><pre><code>init resource
init resource
init resource
init resource
resolving resource
resource is init
no need to init resource we have it
resource is init
resolving resource
resource is init
no need to init resource we have it
resource is init
resolving resource
resource is init
.......</code></pre><p>The output of the function will clearly indicate that we are initing the resource much more than the desired once. Heres the problem, during this 5 sec of initialization we will receive approximately 25 requests, Each of those times the if statement will have a false evaluation and a new request will fire summing up to more then 25 times. after at least 5 sec from the beginning, we will finally receive an instance and the if statement will finally evaluate to false as we desired, still, we have many new init request in the pipeline that we do not need anymore</p><p>Conclusion: a simple if statement examining the resource is inited or not is just not good enough, we need to create some sort of lock mechanism so we can ensure a single init of our resource (again the multithreaded singleton problem).</p><h3><span id="The_JS_lock_%E2%80%93_first_try"></span>The JS lock – first try<span></span></h3><p>Our goal is to create a general-purpose lock so we can reuse it. There are a few ways we can create the requested lock let’s examine the following</p><p>Our lock will be initialized with the number of users that can enter the critical section – in our case we set it to only one.</p><p>Now that we have a lock we will need to block the critical section, we will pass to the lock a callback function that will run our initialization unit.</p><p>The lock will examine how many requests are currently in the critical section if noon it will just let your callback function run, else it will queue your callback until the current user will release it. Once it has been released it the lock will fetch the first callback in the queue and run it.</p><p>Since the callback will run in a different context, be aware to make sure you bind all of your code or use an arrow function to maintain your current context (this).</p><pre><code>class Lock {
  counter: number; // how many can enter the critical section at once
  waiters: any[];

  constructor(counter) {
    this.counter = counter; // how many users can use the resource at one, set 1 for regular lock
    this.waiters = []; // all the callback that are waiting to use the resource
  }

  hold(cb: Function) {
    if (this.counter &gt; 0) { // there is no one waiting for the resource
      this.counter--; // update the resource is in usage
      cb();  // fire the requested callback
    } else {
      this.waiters.push(cb); // the resource is in usage you need to wait for it
    }
  }

  release() { // some one just release the resource - pop the next user who is waiting and fire it
    if (this.waiters.length &gt; 0) { // some one released the lock - so we need to see who is waiting and fire it
      const cb = this.waiters.pop(); // get the latest request for the lock
      // select the relevant one
      // process.nextTick(cb); // if you are on node
      setTimeout(() =&gt; cb, 0); // if you are in the browser
    } else {
      this.counter++;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Ok now let’s integrate it to solve our issue, the only thing we need to remember is once we enter the lock we need to verify again that the resource is not initialized since once we entered the lock after an unknown time the resource may or may not have been initialized – so we need to validate it again (this is known as the double if in the singleton pattern<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="example (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton-double-checked-locking" target="_blank"> example</a>).</p><pre><code>class Lock {

We can do better. We can try and move the “promise” code to the lock and just await on the lock – much cleaner.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.talkinghightech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pexels-photo-101808.jpeg" alt="The JS Lock" width="529" height="342" title="You are probably not initializing your resource objects correctly ( JS lock ). 2"><figcaption>The JS Lock</figcaption></figure><h3><span id="The_JS_Lock_%E2%80%93_Refactored"></span>The JS Lock – Refactored<span></span></h3><pre><code>class Lock {

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

<p>Pay no attention to all those nasty left-wing allegations about how military contractors collude and conspire with the Pentagon to warp our economy, impoverish our citizens, pervert our national goals, and foment needless bloody wars that slaughter millions in order to fatten corporate profits. The truth is actually much worse than you could ever imagine—as this <a href="https://www.claritypress.com/product/understanding-the-war-industry/">chilling new book</a> by Christian Sorensen makes startlingly clear.</p>



<p>Rather than simply having what President Dwight Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex, we actually have a military-industrial-<em>congressional</em> complex, with a media and academic adjunct. </p>



<blockquote><p>The network of overseas military bases extends to remote regions of the world, which were traditionally the domain of other imperial powers. </p></blockquote>

<p>Since the creation of AFRICOM in 2007, for example, the U.S. military has obtained an outpost in Mali, drone bases in Niger, Djibouti, the Seychelles and Kenya, National Security Agency (NSA) facilities in Ethiopia, and flies drones over war-ravaged Libya and Somalia.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is today one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, having been exempted from the 1998 Kyoto protocol and Paris climate change agreement (when the U.S. was abiding by it). There are also now at least 39,000 contaminated military sites across the U.S. and growing numbers of species threatened with extinction and people sickened by the toxic residues of American weapons systems.</p>



<p>In 2018, the top-five war corporations made more than $16 billion at a time when 500,000 Americans were homeless on an average every day. To sustain their obscene profits, they spend millions lobbying Capitol Hill and divvy out millions in campaign contributions to Congress. In 2012 alone, war corporations gave around $30 million and $25.5 million in 2014.</p>



<blockquote><p>Much of this money has gone to appropriation and armed services committees, which rubber stamp gargantuan military budgets that amount to more than the total of the next ten countries combined.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island’s Jack Reed (D), characteristically took money from General Dynamics, Raytheon, Textron, Apollo Global Management (a private equity firm heavy into war industry) and large investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, and used his position to help Textron win a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-textron-bombs-idUSBRE97J0ZF20130820">U.S. contract</a>&nbsp;valued at $641 million to build 1,300 cluster bombs for Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>James Inhofe, Oklahoma’s Republican climate-change denying Senator who has headed the committee under Donald Trump, has taken donations from Boeing, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Huntington-Ingalls, and Orbital TK, along with over $338,000 in the last five years from the oil and gas industry, which profits significantly from overseas military intervention and huge military budgets that Inhofe has always championed.</p>

<p>Besides a corrupted Congress, the military-industrial complex is sustained by the revolving door of Generals who transition from high-ranking military posts to the executive boards of defense contractors where they lobby for ever higher military budgets. James Mattis characteristically went from Commander of the U.S. Central Command to a member of the board of General Dynamics, where he swore before Congress that reduced military spending was a threat to U.S. national security, to appointment in January 2017 as Secretary of Defense, where he oversaw increases in weapons sales and the U.S. war budget. Other high-ranking officials, like former CIA Director John Brennan, have found lucrative jobs peddling new wars on television or in think tanks financed by military corporations.</p>







<p>Sorensen writes that, after pumping the War on Terror for trillions in military spending, the war industry is now “returning to targeting Russia and China through ‘Great Power competition.’” This has “given the Pentagon an excuse to deploy more corporatized troops, mercenaries and goods and services right up to Russia’s borders, while Pentagon leadership has stylized such a permanent war footing as conducive to peace.”</p>



<blockquote><p>The U.S. Executive Branch has meanwhile come to take on the function of an international arms peddler.</p></blockquote>



<p>On any given day, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages 14,000 open foreign military sales cases with 185 countries. The latter include some of the most oppressive on the planet like Israel, which systematically oppresses the Palestinians, using weapons manufactured by Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Motorola and Northrop Grumman, and Saudi Arabia, which has used hardware from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to pulverize Yemen.</p>



<p>From May 2015 through March 2016, American war corporations sold over $30 billion worth of goods and services also to anti-democratic Gulf allies such as the United Arab Emirates, which waged the dirty war in Yemen by proxy and was known for the brutal suppression of dissenting groups. In the Southern Hemisphere, U.S. military and corporate action yielded devastating costs in countries like Honduras and Colombia, where aerial defoliation programs have poisoned the landscape and paramilitary death squads have terrorized trade union activists and supporters of the left-wing Fuerzas Armada Revolucionario de Colombia (FARC) whose principal platform is to redistribute land and wealth.</p>

<p>By law, the U.S. is not allowed to sell weapons to regimes that come to power through coup d’états. However, the war industry successfully lobbied the government not to recognize blatant coups, like that in Egypt in 2013 and Ukraine in 2014. The war industry at the same time does everything in its power to sustain conflicts like in the Koreas, where it profits from an endless military standoff.</p>

<p>It is also in the process of provoking new ones through the Asia Pivot policy that has resulted in the military encirclement of China, promotion of NATO expansion towards Russia’s borders, and deployment of missile technology in Poland and Romania aimed directly at Russia. The inauguration of a $1.74 trillion nuclear modernization effort could ultimately lead humanity down the road to apocalypse.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of Sorensen’s contributions is to show how the war industry sustains a progressive veneer by stressing its “green initiatives” and the diversity of its workforce.</p></blockquote>



<p>John Brennan’s tenure as CIA Director from 2013 to 2017 was marked by his extending new opportunities for African Americans, and many CEOs are now women, like Marilyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin who was voted as “Forbes” most powerful woman in business for three years in a row. Hewson’s feminism, however, does not go very far if we consider her praise for the Saudi regime, which systematically persecutes women, or support for wars which kill women and children, and destroy families.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Pentagon—which Sorensen rightfully calls the “War Department”—failed an audit of more than 2.7 trillion dollars in assets. The accounting firms carrying out the audit concluded that the Pentagon’s financial records were “riddled with so many bookkeeping deficiencies, irregularities and errors that a reliable audit was simply impossible.”</p>



<p>Franklin “Chuck” Spinney, a former Pentagon employee, pointed out a pertinent accounting trick where the Pentagon routinely overestimates inflation rates for weapons systems and does not return the excess funds to the Treasury when actual inflation rates turn out to be lower. Tricks like this result in surplus slush funds which are used to fund shady covert military operations in places like sub-Saharan Africa, whose mineral wealth multi-national corporations covet.</p>



<p>The Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965) once stated that “we live in an era of the scientific savage, where all the wisdom of science, mathematics and physics are used for the purpose of assassination.” These remarks were made before the popularization of the drone, one of the war industry’s favorite products, which has been used to kill at least 8,000 people.</p>

<p>A good first step toward challenging the power of the war industry would be a program of peace education that would create a broader awareness of its harmful activities among the U.S. electorate. Unfortunately, the American educational system has been corrupted and conditions kids from a young age to go along with the status quo. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests forced the removal of military-related research from major universities, but such research returned with a vengeance starting with the budgetary cutbacks of the 1980s and then as part of the War on Terror. Professors now compete with one another for grants that …</p></div></div>

<p>Sometimes secondhand books can come into our possession in ways that make it quite clear they need us to read them.</p>
<p>Such was the case with&nbsp;<em>Le fascisme italien</em>&nbsp;by Pierre Milza and Serge Berstein, (1) which reached me by means of a random sequence of events including a friend moving flat, an unexpected traffic jam and a small public park on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint and, as I am about to explain in more detail, helped me to see a number of crucial issues more clearly.</p>
<p>Firstly, it confirmed that, despite constant claims to the contrary, fascism was not at all anti-capitalist, but extremely pro-capitalist.</p>
<p>Secondly, it presented interesting parallels with the Coronavirus-linked totalitarian mindset so dominant in 2020, which I am calling ‘newnormalism’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it sparked some wider reflection on my part about the participation of most of the left in this 21st century authoritarianism and how that relates to my own anti-fascist position.</p>
<p><strong>FASCISM AND CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p>It is well known, I think, that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, began his political career on the left and, when he started building a movement immediately after the First World War, the initial programme that attracted support was left-wing, with anarchist influences.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Milza-and-Berstein-543x900.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="552"></figure>
</div>
<p>However, as Milza and Berstein make abundantly clear, this prototype fascism was quickly and drastically ditched as Mussolini realised the only way he was going to gain the power he craved was with the support of capitalists and big landowners.</p>
<p>Much much later, at the end of the Second World War, in a desperate last-ditch attempt to rally the Italian people behind them in the face of defeat, the hardcore fascist Saló republic rediscovered their socialist side, but it was all hopelessly too late.</p>
<p>Having lived through the fascist&nbsp;<em>ventennio</em>&nbsp;(20 years), the population were not going to fall for any more redwashing attempts or superficial anti-bourgeois posturing. They had seen clearly that fascism in power defended the interests of Capital, rather than the people.</p>
<p>The authors trace this story back to 1910, when the Italian Nationalist Association was founded with “the support of certain business circles, in particular that of heavy industry”, (2) who had a very obvious direct vestes interest in promoting the nationalist call for Italian participation in the approaching war in Europe.</p>
<p>It was Mussolini’s sudden support for Italy going to war (on the Allied side), that led to him being thrown out of the socialist party, the PSI, splitting from others on the left. This left him ideally placed to benefit from capitalist funding, though it is not clear whether his conversion to the war cause was actually motivated by this consideration.</p>
<p>It is known that Mussolini received money from the French government and from pro-war businessmen like Filippo Naldi.</p>
<p>The first fascist general assembly in 1919 took place in a hall in Milan lent by a group of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascism benefited greatly from the ruling classes’ fear of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Italy, with post-war waves of strikes and a rural movement which reclaimed land from rich property owners.</p>
<p>Explain the authors: “The fear born in the world of the country landowners as a result of the land occupation movement greatly outlived the phenomenon itself and helped pushed them into the arms of fascism, through fear of a challenge to property rights”. (3)</p>
<p>Business organisations such as&nbsp;<em>Confagricoltura</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Confindustria</em>&nbsp;were set up to defend capitalism. Fascism was happy to win favour by providing them with foot soldiers, squadristi, who physically attacked trade unionists and leftists in a wave of “preventative counter-revolution”. (4)</p>
<p>This, say Milza and Berstein, represented fascism’s big break and funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascists started receiving the support of local authorities, the army and the police in their fight against leftist ‘subversion’. They were the system’s emergency weapon against the threat of revolution.</p>
<p>“Prefects, magistrates and officers of the Carabinieri, let the fascists carry on and assure them of impunity. The moment that the State started to crumble, the bourgeoisie, so frightened by the popular uprising of 1919-20, lent their support to fascism’s reactionary violence”. (5)</p>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/squadristi.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Fascist squadristi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In November 1920, for instance, violent fascist squads descended on Bologna, where the radical left had gained control of the local council. There were nine deaths and more than 100 injuries.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the next couple of years, they smashed up trade union and co-operative HQs and attacked working-class districts, wielding clubs and revolvers to force strikers back to work.</p>
<p>By now the fascists had stopped pretending to be left-wing and were openly singing the praises of capitalism and economic liberalism. (6)</p>
<blockquote><p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Mussolini himself set before the future party a manfesto which no longer owed anything to the leftist tendencies of 1919. In the economic realm it was absolute liberalism, with the State indulging in no intervention or nationalisation, or any fiscal measures deemed ‘populist’. On the political and social side, a strong State was to be created, capable of imposing the ban on strikes in the public sector”. (7)</p>
<p>This was authoritarian capitalism, meant to please “the big money interests from whom Mussolini was now seeking political and financial backing”. (8)</p>
<p>As the future dictator said himself: “We are liberal economically, but we will never be so politically”. (9) This was a question of sacrificing political liberalism in the interests of economic liberalism, aka capitalism. (10) (<em>For more on the little-appreciated similarities between fascism and liberalism, see&nbsp;<a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/articles/liberalism-the-two-faced-tyranny-of-wealth/">this article</a>&nbsp;on the orgrad website</em>)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/mussolini-rally2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></figure>
<p>Once the fascists were in power, the clamp-down on opposition was ruthless. Strikes were banned and workers found themselves defenceless against their bosses.</p>
<p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class. When finance minister Alberto De Stefani reformed the tax system in 1923 this “was above all to the profit of the rich”. (11)</p>
<p>He offered tax breaks for foreign investors, did away with the “red tape” of bodies controlling food prices and rents, ended state funding for co-operatives and halted land reforms which threatened the interests of rich landowners.</p>
<p>After 1925, in the face of economic crisis, the pure economic liberalism of the Manchester School went out of the window, in favour of state intervention.</p>
<p>But this was intervention in the interests of business and Capital, not in the interests of the Italian people whom fascism mendaciously claimed to represent!</p>
<p>‘Development’ was at the forefront of fascist plans, as is the case with all industrial capitalists. More land was cultivated and an infrastructure of roads, new towns and industrial estates was built.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Turin-Milan-autostrada.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>“A vast programme of public works was undertaken, carried out by private firms, who were offered lucrative contracts by the State. Electrification of the rail system began, with the construction of tunnels on the Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence lines. A massive roadbuilding programme was entrusted to ANAS (Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade), created in 1928, which oversaw the showcase construction of big toll motorways, the first in Europe”. (12)</p>
<p>This was nothing other than a bailing-out of the capitalist economy by the pro-business fascist state, for which the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the public.</p>
<p>Ring any bells in 2020?</p>
<p>Banks were also treated to fascist largesse, notably BCI, saved by the Italian state with a massive influx of money.</p>
<p>Note the authors: “There was neither socialisation nor nationalisation. The State became capitalist; it guaranteed the property of most of the shareholders and their future dividends. The only socialisation was that of the losses, assumed by the public purse”. (13)</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Istituto-Mobiliare-Italiano.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>In 1931, Mussolini even set up a body,&nbsp;<em>L’Istituto mobiliare italiano</em>, with the role of helping businesses in financial trouble, declaring that this was “a means of energetically driving the Italian economy towards its corporative phase, which is to say a system which fundamentally respects private property and initiative, but ties them tightly to the State, which alone can protect, control and nourish them”. (14)</p>
<p>But the emphasis was very much on the big businesses and financiers allied with the fascist regime. Economic crisis saw numerous small and medium-sized firms go to the wall or gobbled up by big companies, as the fascist state aided this concentration of wealth into ever-fewer hands. (15)</p>
<p>“As for the working classes,” add Milza and Berstein, “they paid the price for this alliance, with unemployment, reduced wages and higher cost of living”. (16)</p>
<p>Fascist corporatism, with its officially-approved phoney trade unions, was supposed to bring together workers and bosses in the interests of the nation, but did nothing of the sort: “It allowed big industry and financial groups to use the State’s arbitration and power of coercion to reinforce their positions and impose their law on their employees”. (17)</p>
<p>“Far from being destroyed by fascism as the first proto-fascist manifesto suggested, Italian capitalism found in it a defender which managed to save it from revolution or collapse and went on to reinforce its structures and its means of action”. (18)</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that the bankers of J.P. Morgan boosted the fascist regime with a $100m loan between 1925 and 1927 (19) or that Winston Churchill praised, during a 1927 visit, Mussolini’s success in defending Italy from what he termed international subversion. He meant the radical left. (20)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bucatini is a kind of pasta that's thicker than average and has a hole in the middle. This stunning display of culinary-architectural brilliance allows it to carry 200% of the pasta sauce load of your average spaghetti, making it popular among enthusiasts.	</p><p>Also, it's super hard to find in the United States right now. Apparently this is because somebody has a beef with one of the primary importers / producers of bucatini in the US, La Cello, and brought their product to the attention of the FDA for violating an iron content regulation.</p><p>Their bucatini contained 2.1 milligrams of iron too little to be considered a macaroni (yes, macaroni, that's what we food heathens in the United States call it). The horror! Think of the children!</p><p>I bring this to your attention because these facts are <em>shockingly</em> uninteresting and boring. If I had to memorize them in history class, I would have undoubtedly have gotten an F minus on the quiz.</p><p>And yet these facts are stuck in my head like white on rice, despite how profoundly little they matter to me.</p><p>The cool thing is, I can tell you why.</p><p>I can also tell you why this post has been sitting on the front page of Hacker News all day (a tech news site, need I remind you, not a food channel).</p><p>Hint: it's the same reason.</p><p>The top comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25566652">the Hacker News discussion for this post</a> explains it succinctly:</p><blockquote>The writing style is awesome, I literally laughed out loud. – sam_goody</blockquote><p>In short, the article's voice is hilarious.</p><p>It's witty, endearing, authentic, relatable – so much so that it had the power to make me remember something totally inconsequential simply because of how it was presented.</p><p>If you don't believe me, <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html">see for yourself</a> –&nbsp;I'll bet you read to the very end of the article (or at least you would have, if I didn't put this disclaimer – now you probably won't just because I postulated that you might – at least, I wouldn't if I were you).</p><p>If you want something to be remembered, say it in a memorable way. Mostly, humor does the trick (unless you're writing an obituary).</p><p>My personal takeaway is that I should take less pains to normalize my writing. I should be more comfortable with exposing my internal monologue to the cold hard air of the judgemental world. I think it just might help me to become a better writer.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this article set the tone within the first few sentences:</p><blockquote>Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini.</blockquote><p>There aren't any humor jump-scares going on here, no sir. The author makes it clear what kind of article you're about to... experience, from the very beginning. This makes it easy for the boring people possessing sticks of poor internal alignment to bail, leaving only the easily-amused and the <em>very</em> bored still reading.</p><p>Finally, as with all things, I think writing humor well is something that only comes with intentional practice. I'm deciding to give it a shot here in this blog, partly because writing can be super boring if I'm not amusing myself with wordplay, but mainly because I want to get better at writing compelling things.</p><p>So, um, sorry in advance.</p></section></div>]]>

            A Siren with pixel coordinates together with a time coordinate can be used to parameterize a video.
            Here, Siren is directly supervised with the ground-truth pixel values, and parameterizes video significantly

        <hr>
        <p>
            We can recover an SDF from a pointcloud and surface normals by solving the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=eikonal+equation&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Eikonal
            equation</a>,
            a first-order boundary value problem. SIREN can recover a room-scale scene given only its pointcloud
            and surface normals, accurately reproducing fine detail, in less than an hour of training.
            In contrast to recent work on combining voxel grids with neural implicit representations,
            this stores the full scene in the weights of a single, 5-layer neural network, with no 2D or 3D
            convolutions, and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Zoom in to compare fine detail!
            <b>Note that these SDFs are not supervised with ground-truth SDF / occupancy values, but rather, are the
            result of solving the above Eikonal boundary value problem. This is a significantly harder task,
            which requires supervision in the gradient domain (see paper). As a result, architectures whose gradients
            are not well-behaved perform worse than SIREN.</b>

                    We identify a key relationship between generalization across implicit neural representations and meta-
                    learning, and propose to leverage gradient-based meta-learning for learning priors over deep signed distance
                    functions. This allows us to reconstruct SDFs an order of magnitude faster than the auto-decoder framework,
                    with no loss in performance!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>So I've been using the Github flow for some years now from both the maintainer side and contributor side to open source projects. I've also been using the email workflow for git from both sides for about a year now. Using email for git sounded quite horrible before I actually started using it. Now I prefer it so I thought I would document my experience here.</p><h2 id="the-github-flow">The Github flow</h2><p>This isn't strictly for Github, it's the flow many developers are accustomed to:</p><ol><li>Fork the project repo</li><li>Make a change on your fork</li><li>Create a pull request from a branch on your fork to the main repository</li><li>Get comments on the pull request</li><li>Force-push to the same branch to update the state of the pull request</li><li>Somebody clicks merge</li></ol><p>Basically the same flow is also used on Gitlab and the other smaller git hosting services. This flow works reasonably well. It gets slightly more annoying after the first pull request because you actually have to keep your own local branch up to date.</p><p>In theory this also gives some nice discoverability of people working on the project by looking at the forks of the project. In practice this is a bunch of outdated copies of the project by people who have mistaken the fork button for a like button.</p><p>From a maintainer point of view this flow also works alright, unless your project starts to grow. For example when postmarketOS was still on Github we ran into the issue that the merge button isn't really useful. Once you have a reasonable volume of &nbsp;pull requests the branches of those pull requests get outdated quickly meaning they have to be rebased before merging or every change will have an extra merge commit in the history. </p><p>In the postmarketOS case it was decided that merge commits are extra noise in the git history we'd like to avoid so we'd need to rebase things, and to properly rebase we have to do it from the command line because Github can't deal at all with conflicts. Rebasing from the command line also gives a lot more flexibility with squashing and having a nice commit message. </p><p>The only reason that merge button was used on Github was because Github can't seem to mark the pull request as merged if it isn't done by the button. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>The all-knowing button from Github</figcaption></figure><p>The old workflow documentation postmarketOS had when Github was used can be read in the wiki history: <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441">https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441</a></p><p>Now we've moved to Gitlab we're basically dealing with the same issue, we have to mess with the commits before merging so we're always force-pushing to the git fork of the author of the pull request (which they have to enable on the merge request, if they don't we first have to tell them to enable that checkbox) and then finally merge them with the button in the web UI so Gitlab doesn't lose track of what happened.</p><h2 id="the-git-send-email-flow">The git-send-email flow</h2><p>The flow for pull requests in github isn't the original way to make pull requests. Since git was originally written for the development of the Linux kernel it has been designed with the workflow of the kernel in mind. The kernel uses mailing lists.</p><p>[insert image of horrified developers here]</p><p>The first patch I emailed was with the assistence of <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">https://git-send-email.io/</a>, I needed to learn how to use the email flow because at the time I was working on my very first kernel patch. This was quite a daunting task involing triple-checking everything against the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html">patch submission documentation</a> for Linux which describes the easy 16 step process.</p><p>Then after the final step the email gets sent out and you wait... for response emails.</p><p>Since then I've made contributions to projects hosted on Sourcehut, which also uses the email workflow, and now I also maintain some projects on this platform. For example <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/megapixels">Megapixels</a>.</p><p>This is the workflow for submitting a patch to a project using the email flow:</p><ol><li>Clone the repository locally</li><li>Make your changes on your local checkout</li><li>Run <code>git send-email</code> with a ref pointing to one or a range of commits</li><li>Get comments as response to the patch as emails, mirrored on the webpage of the mailing list</li><li>Fix up your previous mistakes, run <code>git send-email</code> again with the <code>-v2</code> argument to send an updated version</li><li>The maintainer applies the patch from the email.</li></ol><p>As a maintainer getting the patches like this is quite nice since unless there's a conflict you don't have to merge branches or rebase things, the patches is just ... a patch, it only has the changes from the author, not the full git history.</p><p>Also, one thing to note about the process above is that, except for receiving the feedback, it will never touch your mail client. Git does SMTP itself and make sure the emails you send out are up-to-spec so maintainers can apply the changes directly by feeding the email into <code>git am</code></p><p>If your main complaint is that email is horrible to work with, the issue is most likely not email, it's probably your mail client.</p><p>One of the other main issues with the email workflow is that you can't just see the full state of the "pull request" because there's no nice pull request page to see what's happening. This is one of the main reasons I like the mailing lists on Sourcehut, the patch view fixes most of the visibility issues, for example this simple patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382">https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382</a></p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>The overview of a patch submitted to a Sourcehut mailing list</figcaption></figure><p>There you see the patch description in the first block, which is in this case didn't have any extra text added in the <code>git send-email</code> stage, so it only shows a summary of the changes in this patch.</p><p>Below that is the actual patch, with the subject of the patch as header and then showing the full commit message below that if there were more lines and then the full diff. This patch can also be exported directly as a .patch file using the link right of the subject.</p><p>Finally, below the diff is a comment from Eyal who applied this patch to the development branch and thanked the author; the mailing list will generate a nice threaded view here if there's more discussion.</p><p>The block on the right will show the status of the patch, <code>APPLIED</code> in this case and gives some extra tools to get a copy of the full patchset that can be applied using <code>git am</code></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I personally prefer the e-mail workflow now, it saves me from keeping branches/forks up to date as with this workflow only diffs are sent around. Also after working in Gitlab for most of the things I do on postmarketOS I really like how quickly sourcehut pages load and that I just can get all info from the patch without clicking on tabs to switch between comments, diffs and commit messages with loading times in between.</p><p>Also one nice improvement is that instead of doing half the maintainer flow in the browser by clicking things and half by patching stuff up in my local git branch and force pushing that, it just lets me do everything in the shell and then just send an email back telling the author their patch got merged.</p><p>All together people are most likely already used to having all the comments and info emailed to them as notifications, it's just that in the gitlab/hub case it will send you a link to continue on their website and in the sourcehut/email flow case the email is everything you need to continue without ever opening the browser.</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 28th, President Donald Trump signed into law an omnibus spending bill allocating $1.4 trillion in federal funding for the 2021 fiscal year. Covering everything from pandemic-relief provisions to defense spending, the massive bill also contains the FY 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, which codifies U.S. covert and clandestine operations and defines requirements for reporting to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since it was first presented by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in June, this year’s Intelligence Authorization Act has been of unusual interest thanks to an included provision titled “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In this inclusion, the committee offered intriguing support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence” and requested the production of an unclassified report detailing the analysis of UFOs, or as The Pentagon now terms them, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the recent passing of the Omnibus, seemingly the clock is ticking and The Pentagon’s UAP Task Force now has 180 days to provide the Senate Intelligence Committee with their unclassified report detailing The Pentagon’s current investigations into UFOs. However, easily overlooked, the provision is not law and there is still no guarantee that a comprehensive, “all-source” UAP report will end up seeing the light of day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_18471" width="1170" height="878" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Md7zIXWiTw?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The newly enacted Intelligence Authorization Act incorporates the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report language calling for an unclassified, all-source report on the UAP phenomenon. This was accomplished in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the bill,” says Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and former staff Director of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee, who played an integral role in the development of the legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Consequently, it’s now fair to say that the request for an unclassified report on the UAP phenomenon enjoys the support of both parties in both Houses of Congress,” Mellon told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email. “Assuming the Executive Branch honors this important request, the nation will at long last have an objective basis for assessing the validity of the issue and its national security implications. This is an extraordinary and long overdue opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Origins for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s UAP report request can be traced back to December 2017, when the&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New York Times&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">published an article</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;revealing a secretive study within the Pentagon known as The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Coinciding with the article’s publication were the “unofficial” release of three videos captured by the Navy in 2004 and 2015, which showed indistinctive airborne objects claimed to be UAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April 2020, the Department of Defense officially released the three videos, acknowledging in a statement from the Secretary of Defense’s Office that aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified.” In mid-August, the Pentagon formally acknowledged they had established a task force looking into UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_75296" width="1170" height="658" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHunx8BocSI?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office stated, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">authority for the Task Force was approved</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most vocal advocates for a serious investigation into UFO sightings in recent months has been Luis Elizondo, the former Director of the National Programs Special Management Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, who headed up the Pentagon’s AATIP program. In the fall of 2017, Elizondo resigned from the DoD, citing what he felt was a lack of serious attention being placed on the UAP issue. Elizondo would subsequently go to work for the To the Stars Academy, a UFO-centric organization founded by musician Tom DeLonge.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I believe this is a tremendous step forward in that our representatives are taking this topic seriously,” Elizondo told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email, speaking about the approval of the recent Intelligence Authorization Act.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While this news may be exciting for many UFO/UAP enthusiasts, the UAP report provision is not binding law, so there is no guarantee the public will be provided any comprehensive information on UAP. Additionally, if the <a href="https://thedebrief.org/fast-movers-and-transmedium-vehicles-the-pentagons-uap-task-force/">UAP Task Force deems certain information classified</a>, the legislative branch does not have the authority to declassify that information in order to make it publicly available. With a new executive administration taking office in less than a month, it may ultimately come down to the significance the Biden administration, and new presidential appointees place on the UAP issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We must remain diligent in order to ensure any report submitted to Congress is done to the level and expectations of the committee members,” Elizondo said, “and not simply a whitewash to satisfy yet another Congressional requirement.”</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-39751" data-id="39751"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Christopher Mellon remains cautious but optimistic. “The challenge now will be getting the myriad DoD and I.C.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m hopeful the new Administration will rigorously execute its oversight prerogatives because the concerns of the public and numerous U.S. military personnel have been ignored by a complacent national security bureaucracy for far too long,” Mellon said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As 2021 approaches, <a href="https://thedebrief.org/leaked-photo-surfaces-of-purported-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-leaked-ufo-photo/">the UAP issue is more visible than ever.</a> Despite this, the level of accessibility of information included with the Task Force’s forthcoming report remains to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This report, when submitted, will serve as a litmus to determine how seriously the Pentagon takes this topic,” Elizondo said, “and even more so, the authority and the will of the Congress.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Let me remind the Pentagon,” Elizondo added, “that the world is watching and will judge them on their actions.”</span></p>

<h3>[ 2020-December-28 12:49 ]</h3>
<p>When designing applications that store critical data, it is to important to ensure the data will be durable, so it is accessible after a failure. To better understand the guarantees provided by modern systems, I previously wrote about the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">durability guarantees provided by the NVMe disk interface</a>, and by <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">Linux file APIs</a>. In this article, I will describe what I know about durable writes available on cloud infrastructure. In particular, I will look at AWS and Google Cloud, since I know them the best. After reading their documentation carefully, my cloud storage durability recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instance storage can be lost when the machine is restarted by the cloud provider. I would only call it durable if the application is replicated across more than one zone. Don't bother replicating across machines in one zone, since your data will be lost when the whole zone fails at once.</li>
<li>A network disk in one zone is like a physical server: on rare occasions data will be lost (e.g. 1 out of 100k disks/year). This is probably sufficient for many applications. However, you should take periodic snapshots, since they are easy to set up. In case of a rare failure, you can restore from the last snapshot. With snapshots, this is good enough for most applications.</li>
<li>Network disk replicated across zones should be highly available and durable. This is sufficient for mission critical applications with high availability requirements (e.g. 99.999% or greater availability).</li>
<li>Instance storage replicated across zones can be highly available and durable, but you should be careful due to the risk of correlated failure (e.g. accidentally turning off all instances), or misconfigurations leading to everything running in one zone, or not being correctly replicated.</li>
<li>Object storage is basically as durable as a storage system gets.</li>
<li>All important applications need backups, even applications using object storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, if you have data that really matters, it should be replicated across zones and also backed up periodically. One interesting note is that it is impossible for an external customer to test if the cloud storage options correctly implement the durability they claim to provide. This means we can only really judge based on documentation, observed performance, and experience reports. Now let's look at the available options in more detail.</p>


<h2>Instance storage (AWS)/Local disk (GCP)</h2>

<p>The lowest-level storage option available in the cloud is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/amazon-ec2-instance-storage.html">EC2 Instance Storage with AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd">Local SSD with GCP</a>. This is effectively part of a disk that is directly attached to the physical machine running the VM. This should provide the highest performance, since there is no network and fewer devices between your application and the storage medium. However, it also provides the worst durability. Both cloud providers document that applications should be extremely careful when using instance storage. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/durability-and-availability-4.html">AWS says "local instance store volumes are not intended to be used as durable disk storage"</a>. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd">Google says "Local SSDs are suitable only for temporary storage such as caches, processing space, or low value data"</a>. Let's ignore these warnings, and pretend we write an application that uses only a single instance storage disk. How durable is our data (assuming we use the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">correct Linux file APIs</a>)? <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/durability-and-availability-4.html">AWS's documentation states</a> that if there is any issue with the host, such as a power failure or an unscheduled reboot, your data will be lost. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#data_persistence">Google's documentation has a more precise list</a> but is roughly equivalent. The biggest difference is that Google attempts to use live migration to move your VM to another host for scheduled maintenence, and they clearly document that "If the host system experiences a host error, and the underlying drive does not recover within 60 minutes, Compute Engine does not attempt to preserve the data on your local SSD".</p>

<p>In short, local instance storage is lower durability than a single physical disk in a physical server. Not only will your data be lost if the disk fails, but your data will also be lost for any other issue that causes the cloud provider to turn off that machine, such applying a security patch. It also is not clear if your data will survive the machine losing power. AWS's documentation suggests reboots will always lose data, but Google's suggests it might, if it comes back within 60 minutes. In either case, I would not trust instance storage with the only copy of my data.</p>

<p>What about a replicated application using instance storage? <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/usage-patterns-4.html">AWS's documentation suggests this is a great idea</a>: "instance store volumes backed by SSD [...] are ideally suited for many high-performance database workloads [...] like Cassandra and MongoDB, clustered databases, and online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. [...] applications using instance storage for persistent data generally provide data durability through replication". In my opinion, if you want to rely on replicated instance storage, it <strong>must</strong> be replicated across different zones. If your data is stored on multiple instance storage disks in one zone, then all of them will be lost if that zone loses power, catches fire, or someone accidentally triggers the fire suppression system. From the history of major public cloud providers, single zone failures are relatively likely (e.g. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/09/04/aws_power_outage_data_loss/">AWS us-east-1 power issue on 2019-08-31</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/4372T8/">AWS Sydney region issue on 2016-06-05</a>, <a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/15056">GCP europe-west1-b on 2015-08-13</a>). On the other hand, multiple zone failures are exceptionally rare, so it should be possible to build highly available and very durable systems by replicating between zones. I am a bit nervous about the a mistake or misconfiguration taking down all instances and entirely losing all data, so I think backups are critical.</p>


<h2>Network storage (AWS EBS/GCP Persistent Disk)</h2>

<p>Cloud providers provide "disks" where the data is actually stored on multiple physical devices across the network. The providers call these disks durable. AWS in particular says "EBS volumes are designed for an annual failure rate (AFR) of between 0.1 and 0.2 percent [...] This AFR makes EBS volumes 20 times more reliable than typical commodity disk drives, which fail with an AFR of around 4 percent." Google does not publish their design targets, but similarly claims "Persistent disks have built-in redundancy to protect your data against equipment failure". Google also provides regional persistent disk, that automatically replicates across zones to survive single zone failures.</p>

<p>In my opinion, application data is safer in a cloud network disk than on a single physical disk. There is more than one disk involved, so it will survive the occasional "random" disk failure. However, they are not perfect. In particular, single zone failures that cause a large number of physical machines to fail at once do happen. During these incidents, customers have permanently lost disks. I personally like to think of an application with data on network storage to be roughly the same durability as a physical server with RAID. It will survive many failures, but data will be lost on rare occasions. Both AWS and Google recommend that customers take periodic disk snapshots, so disks can be restored in case of failure. These disk snapshots are fast, easy and cheap, so I highly recommend doing this for any disks with important data. Just remember to test restoring the snapshots periodically, to make sure you know how to do it, and that they actually work.</p>

<p>The next level of durability is to store application data on multiple network disks in different zones. These applications should be highly durable, since a failure would have to occur across multiple disks in multiple zones. Cloud providers design zones to fail independently, so this should be an exceptionally rare event. This is an excellent configuration for applications that need the highest availability and durability.</p>


<h2>Do you need to use forced disk writes with cloud network disks?</h2>

<p>An interesting question is if applications need to use forced disk writes with cloud network disks to get durable writes. That is, if the does not send a FUA write or cache flush (see <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">my article about the NVMe interface</a>), will writes survive if the host machine or the entire zone loses power? Unfortunately, only the cloud providers can really answer this question. However, from the information I have found, it appears that both AWS and GCP disks only acknowledge writes after replication when the writes are considered durable. I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18980193">found a comment from an AWS engineer that claims</a> "All writes to EBS are durability recorded to nonvolatile storage before the write is acknowledged to the operating system running in the EC2 instance [...] explicit FUA / flush / barriers are not required for data durability". This means writes will survive both the host failing and the entire zone losing power. I have not been able to find similar information for GCP persistent disk, but testing with FUA writes and cache flushes shows that they appear to have nearly zero impact on throughput or latency, so I suspect it is the same. This means that applications could get away with <code>O_DIRECT</code> writes only, and FUA writes and cache flushes are probably unnecessary. However, since there is nearly no performance impact, you might as well use <code>O_DSYNC</code> or <code>fdatasync</code> anyway, since then your application will work correctly on other disks. My guess is that Amazon and Google implement this with the equivalent of battery-backed RAM, just like hardware RAID disk controllers often do.</p>


<h2>Object storage (S3/GCS)</h2>

<p>The object storage systems (AWS S3, GCP GCS) provide very ambitious durability claims. They store data in multiple zones, and claim they will only lose some astronomically small fraction of objects. This type of storage is basically as good as it gets in terms of durability guarantees. However, these impressive claims do nothing to protect you from bugs, mistakes, or bad actors. If your primary data storage is in one of these systems, you should still …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Kotlin’s data classes are cool. They are the recommended way of replacing POJOs
and it is usually recommended to use them with <code>val</code>s so the classes are
immutable.</p>
<p>They come with a handy <code>copy()</code> method that “clones” the data class, which can
also be parameterized with any named argument, so the new object has all the
fields of the original class + the overridden fields. So far so good.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-kotlins-copy-work-under-the-hood">How does Kotlin’s copy() work under the hood?</h3>
<p>The way this is implemented in the bytecode is by adding two methods that do all
the heavy-lifting. e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>// shared.kt 
data class Shared(
  val st: String = "some string"
)
</code></pre><p>If we inspect the bytecode of this class we see something like:</p>
<pre><code>$ javap -l Shared.class # I'm trimming irrelevant stuff

...
  public final Shared copy(java.lang.String, boolean, long);
    descriptor: (Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_FINAL
    Code:
      stack=6, locals=5, args_size=4
         0: new           #2                  // class Shared
         3: dup
         4: aload_1
         5: iload_2
         6: lload_3
         7: invokespecial #35                 // Method "&lt;init&gt;":(Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)V
        10: areturn

...

  public static Shared copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, int, java.lang.Object);
    descriptor: (LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC
.... truncated
</code></pre><p>We see here two different copy methods. One is a member method that receives all
parameters necessary to create a copy of a data class. Not sure why this one is
necessary since it basically just calls the constructor of the data class.</p>
<p>In this particular example, it loads the string (<code>aload1</code> to load the first
parameter, i.e. the String), the boolean (<code>iload2</code>), and the long (<code>lload3</code>) and
calls the constructor (<code>invokespecial ... &lt;init&gt;</code>) of the class with that, and
returns that reference (<code>aretrun</code>).</p>
<p><code>copy$default</code> seems to be the one method calling the <code>copy()</code> method. It has a
more interesting signature: it receives the instance being copied (the first
param), followed by all the fields of the data class, followed by an <code>int</code>, and
then a weird <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s first see the bytecode for something using the copy method:</p>
<pre><code>// some.kt
fun doSomething(arg: Shared) {
    println(arg.copy(st = "new-value", l = 10L))
}
</code></pre><p>The bytecode for the code above:</p>
<pre><code>javap -c SomeKt.class 
Compiled from "some.kt"
public final class SomeKt {
  public static final void doSomething(Shared);
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: ldc           #9                  // String arg
       3: invokestatic  #15                 // Method kotlin/jvm/internal/Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter:(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;)V
       6: aload_0
       7: ldc           #17                 // String new-value
       9: iconst_0
      10: ldc2_w        #18                 // long 10l
      13: iconst_2
      14: aconst_null
      15: invokestatic  #25                 // Method Shared.copy$default:(LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
      18: astore_1
      19: iconst_0
      20: istore_2
      21: getstatic     #31                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      24: aload_1
      25: invokevirtual #37                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
      28: return
}
</code></pre><p>The fun part starts at instruction 6: the arguments for the <code>copy$default</code>
method are prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>6 aload_0</code>: loads the instance of <code>Shared</code> to be copied (first parameter for <code>copy$default()</code>)</li>
<li><code>7: ldc</code> this loads the “new-value” constant</li>
<li><code>9: iconst_0</code> loads the boolean</li>
<li><code>10: ldc2_w</code> loads the long param</li>
<li><code>13 iconst_2</code> loads a mysterious int. More on this later.</li>
<li><code>aconst_null</code> passes null as last parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with this information, the <code>copy$default</code> method is responsible for
figuring out which fields it has to copy from the original object and which ones
it needs to override. My guess here is that it uses the int as a mask to infer
this… let’s see if that’s the case. This is the bytecode for the
<code>copy$default</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>  public static Shared copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, int, java.lang.Object);
    descriptor: (LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC
    Code:
      stack=5, locals=7, args_size=6
         0: iload         5
         2: iconst_1
         3: iand
         4: ifeq          12
         7: aload_0
         8: getfield      #11                 // Field st:Ljava/lang/String;
        11: astore_1
        12: iload         5
        14: iconst_2
        15: iand
        16: ifeq          24
        19: aload_0
        20: getfield      #19                 // Field b:Z
        23: istore_2
        24: iload         5
        26: iconst_4
        27: iand
        28: ifeq          36
        31: aload_0
        32: getfield      #25                 // Field l:J
        35: lstore_3
        36: aload_0
        37: aload_1
        38: iload_2
        39: lload_3
        40: invokevirtual #47                 // Method copy:(Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)LShared;
        43: areturn

</code></pre><p>The fun starts right at the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0: iload 5</code> we are loading that interesting <code>int</code> into the operand stack</li>
<li><code>2: iconst_1</code>  then we load the constant <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>3: iand</code> then we <code>AND</code> those 2 integers. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iand">The result is is push into the operand stack.</a></li>
<li><code>4: ifeq 12</code> means that if the result of the previous step is == 0, then we
jump to instruction 12. Otherwise, we execute the following instruction.
<ul>
<li>When the <code>ifeq</code> does not succeed we replace the parameter (in
this case the first String) with whatever is inside the original object
(<code>aload_0</code> to load the object, <code>getfield</code> to get the String field,
<code>astore_1</code> to replace the method parameter with that value).</li>
<li>Otherwise, it means we need to use whatever value provided as argument to
<code>copy$default</code>, i.e. we will override that field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Same deal for the other two parameters. And then:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>36: aload_0</code> and then <code>aload_1</code>, <code>iload_2</code>, <code>lload_3</code> are used to load the
parameters (or the values we replaced before) into the operand stack so they
can be passed to the <code>copy()</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is not 100% clear, this is what the code would look like if in Java:</p>
<pre><code>public static Shared copy$default(Shared original, String s, boolean b, long l, int mask, Object x) {
    if (mask &amp; 1 == 0) s = original.st;
    if (mask &amp; 2 == 0) b = original.b;
    if (mask &amp; 4 == 0) l = original.l;
    return copy(s, b, l);
}
</code></pre><p>From this, we can infer that this <code>mask</code> int is hardcoded into the bytecode for
calls of <code>.copy()</code>. In the example above, where we are overriding the first and
third fields of the class it passed the number 2 (<code>iconst_2</code>). In binary <code>010</code>,
which when used in the <code>copy$default</code> means exactly that: override the first and
third parameter, but reuse the middle one.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting that the extra <code>Object</code> parameter has no apparent use.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>Ok, so this was fun, but what’s the point. Why is this bad?</p>
<p>This is pretty nice, but I found it can cause issues sometimes. Imagine the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data class lives in library A, v1</li>
<li>Library B uses A-v1 and also calls the <code>copy</code> method.</li>
<li>App X uses both libraries A-v1 and B.</li>
<li>All of them with a different release cadence, and potentially the
responsibility of different teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good. Now imaging we update the data class in library A and add a new field:</p>
<pre><code>data class Shared(
  val st: String? = "some string",
  val b: Boolean = false,
  val l: Long = 0L,
  val extra: String? = null
)
</code></pre><p>This might seem like a safe change. We added a new field, but it should not
interfere with any usage of this class. It is in theory backward compatible.</p>
<p>Say we now release library A v2 with this change. And App X upgrades to this new
version. App compiles and releases fine, except that you get a nasty surprise at
runtime:</p>
<pre><code> java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'Shared.copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, java.lang.String, int, java.lang.Object)'
</code></pre><p>Ooops. Library B’s bytecode still relies on the old signature of library A v1,
and so it fails to invoke that method.</p>
<p>This sucks because technically the class should be compatible. In fact, updating
to library A v2 in library B should compile fine (the bytecode will change to
include the new signature).</p>
<p>In fact, if this was done in old good Java without anything fancy it would have
just worked, i.e. assuming the <code>copy</code> feature is implemented manually like this:</p>
<pre><code>// some.java
void doSomething(Shared arg) {
  Shared copy = new Shared();
  copy.st = "new-value";
  copy.b = arg.b;
  copy.l = arg.l;
  System.out.println(arg);
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, the verbose, naive, explicit, ugly Java version would not break
production as Kotlin did.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Just be careful when using <code>.copy()</code> especially when the data class is going to
be shared in a library.</p>
<p>This is nothing new (breaking prod because of incompatible library versions),
except that it sucks that the change is technically backward compatible.</p>
<p>Fancy language features are not magic and can come with nasty surprises.</p>

</ul>

<p>In 2019 I did my undergraduate thesis on the home-made ionic diodes that I've previously blogged about, with the hope of finding a way that some form of homemade (low-technology) ionic amplifying device could be devised.  I didn't succeed, but I found out about a whole pile of cool stuff.</p>

<p>For those not familiar: if you can make certain types of amplifying device (eg inverters) then you are most of the way to making devices that can do any computation.  Traditional IC technologies, like the many families of <span>CMOS, </span>are very performative but are a completely unapproachable technology for most students and experimenters ($$$$$+). You simply can't "make your own IC at home" -- the closest I have seen are people making some individual transistors (after lots of effort, investment in chemicals and furnaces).  You can also solder off-the-shelf parts onto a <span>PCB </span>to make an "IC", but this provides minimal educational value for actual IC development and has a wildly different list of tradeoffs.</p>

<p>The devices I looked at have absolutely garbage performance (speeds in single-digit Hz at best, lifetime in minutes) but also had some mild promises of achieving transistor-like functionality.  I still have hope that someone will devise a method of making home-technology ionic integrated circuits, but I never cracked the grail of transistor-like devices.</p>


<h2>Thesis download </h2>

<p><a href="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/Hales%20-%20Thesis%20B%20submission%202019%20(signatureremoved).pdf">My full thesis <span>PDF</span></a> goes into great detail of a variety of topics and experiments.  In this blog post I'm just going to summarise some more of the interesting things and show pretty pictures.</p>

<p>If any links to <span>PDF</span>s or other resources die (especially the 1920's magazines): please tell me, I have backup copies of everything.</p>

<p>There are lots of errors and informalities in my thesis, my passion isn't in formal writing and I'm a one man band.  Nonetheless I will appreciate it if you take the time to read my stuff and provide discussion, criticism or feedback. Keep in mind that many of my peers did their thesis entirely in simulation, I was lucky enough to be able to negotiate a topic that was much wilder and open-ended.</p>



<h2>Recreating the glow</h2>

<p>I managed to get the aluminium foil and bicarb soda diodes to glow!  Homemade kitchen-ingredient photon throwers, no fancy equipment required.</p>

<p>In this first image I have aluminium foil tape glowing inside a pool of electrolyte in a drinking glass.  (i) shows with power off, (ii) shows with 100VAC (50Hz) applied:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/glow%20even%20horiz.jpeg"></p>

<p>Very interestingly: my whitish glow colour was completely different to all of the literature which claimed it should be green.  </p>

<p>The full circuit is two back-to-back aluminium electrolyte diodes (see full thesis <span>PDF</span>), with the second electrode not within frame of the photos above. Lifetime was measured in hours if operated correctly, however they would slowly dim.</p>

<p>I adapted this from a drinking glass to a planar style with the goal of imitating IC-style construction.  Aluminium foil, sticky tape and a clear plastic slide (aka 'overhead transparency slide'):</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/films_small.jpeg" alt="" height="667" width="424"></p>

<p>Note the slightly different colours on the exposed sections of aluminium.  These are the oxide/hydroxide layers that grow after you put a drop of electrolyte (water + bicarb soda) on the contacts and slowly apply an AC voltage (starting from 0V, finishing somewhere around 100VAC).</p>

<p>This planar style also glowed reliably once I had some parameters down (mainly purer water).  Here is a photo taken through a cardboard tube, with a little bit of light leaking in around the edges.  Again (i) is power off and (ii) is with 100VAC+ applied:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/glow%20doublework.jpeg"></p>


<p>I have previously only been able to find <a href="http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/els/borax-el.htm">a single photo of this phenomena</a>.  I was pretty chuffed when it worked, more so when I found it repeatable :)</p>

<p>Mentions of this glow are otherwise mostly limited to 1920's magazines like (page 48 of <span>PDF</span>) <a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-News/20s/Radio-News-1926-08-R.pdf">Radio News for August 1926 'Chemical Condensers of Large Capacity' by Clyde J Fitch</a> and (page 29 of <span>PDF</span>) <a href="http://www.rsp-italy.it/Electronics/Magazines/QST/_contents/QST%201921_09.pdf"><span>QST</span> 1921 September 'Operating Notes on Electrolytic Rectifiers' by Roy Atkinson</a>.  </p>

<p>I made (and destroyed) a lot more of these devices than shown here.  They have many limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>dim, can't be seen in daylight</li>
<li>need about 100VAC (some literature claims much lower is possible, perhaps 30VAC?)</li>
<li>need very clean water ("demineralised" from a store should work well enough)</li>
<li>need to be formed with <span>AC, </span>but can then be run with DC (temporarily, until one of the aluminium contacts poisons and dims)</li>
<li>can't be used as part of a larger IC made using similar materials, as they require much greater than the breakdown voltage (of similar individual ionic diodes) to light.</li>
</ul>

<p>See my full thesis <span>PDF </span>for more chemistry, operations, theory &amp; history of these devices.</p>







<h2>Transistor proofs: methodology and misdirection</h2>

<p>I was really disappointed by a lot of sources.  Not just random websites or magazine articles: published papers didn't seem to be much better.</p>

<p>Ionic devices were mostly abandoned in the mid 1900's due to the advent of more promising solid-state technologies (like germanium &amp; silicon), so prior material on ionic devices is very sparse.  In recent years some more research has picked up, but many published papers and websites that initially show promise end up being useless for my goals, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>Things that "transist" (change impedance) by some definition, but in ways that are useless for making chainable logic or even basic amplifiers.</li>
<li>Devices that look like they <em>might</em> amplify, but upon further inspection are actually something simpler (eg a resistive voltage divider).</li>
<li>Under-described experiments with miraculous results that no-one has managed to recreate, eg transistors made of nothing but ice and metal contacts.</li>
<li>Explanations that use words like 'cold fusion'.  Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 5 of my report is dedicated to questioning research and claims around ionic transistors.  If you have a good grasp of discrete transistor logic and discrete amplifiers then this may be amusing to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/part5-1.png"></p>

<p>I go into a lot of detail of what is and isn't useful in a transistor-like-device if you want to make logic circuits or amplifiers:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/figure20.png"></p>

<p>"This device is likely a transformer" is about as passive-aggressive insulting as I think I've ever been to a totally imaginary device.  Nonetheless it's very important to properly contemplate &amp; criticise all of these fictional examples, otherwise you end up accidentally convincing yourself that your have created a useful amplifier (like I did at one point with one of my experiments).</p>

<p>I was really eager to try and recreate an experiment by Letaw and Bardeen (minus the massive quantities of mercury, which for some reason my supervisor didn't want me to have).  Sadly in the end I realised that their own data didn't support their device actually being a useful or functional amplifier in any way (section 5.7.1).  I was pretty miffed.</p>



<h2>Alternative technologies for home-technology ICs</h2>

<p>It's always worth considering that your current path isn't the best path.</p>

<p>A lot of traditional transistor designs simply don't work at a macro-manageable scale, they need micron-thin insulators or active regions.  I explore scaling several of these ideas up to macro ('kitchen-technology') scale in section 6.2 of my report.  Interestingly: ionic transistor research (at the nano scale) has yielded working devices over the past few decades, so there are some less mainstream ideas worth trying to scale up from there too.</p>

<p>Chapter 8 of my thesis report outlines some crazier ideas to try.  Resonant tunnel-diode logic concepts could potentially make logic circuits out of the ionic diodes I already have (they have some funky behaviour when driven to higher voltages, including some hysteresis).  Bubble-control transistors are an idea where gas-bubble positions are abused to modulate fluid conductivity, ie turn the 'bad' electrolysis I get on my contacts into something useful):</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/trans3.jpeg" alt="" height="1050" width="1400"></p>

<p>Ideally I would avoid this whole wet-state-electronics concept, but it was the most promising path I had thanks to the working ionic diodes I had previously developed.</p>



<h2>Pretty construction methods and various oddities</h2>

<p>Making a single functional diode was possible with a (relatively unreactive) coin, sticky-tape, aluminium foil, bicarb soda and water:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/coin.JPG" alt="" height="400" width="497"></p>

<p>The above shows an over-saturated solution (white).  My later tests used much more controlled concentrations, so the fluids appear as transparent water instead:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/interdig_1_small.jpeg" alt="" height="754" width="612"></p>

<p>Interdigitated gold electrodes were made on clear slide transparency (ie the clear A4-sized pieces of plastic you print onto for overhead projectors).  The fingers are made of gold-leaf foil (very cheap) and double-sided tape. Cheap kapton clone tape was used as an insulator.  Ordinary clear sticky-tape works just as well, but I found photo examples were easier to make with the coloured kapton:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/trans4.jpeg" alt="" height="657" width="840"></p>

<p>Note that the two sets of gold contacts shown above are slightly different colours.  The photographed specimen had been used under DC conditions, which affected each electrode differently.</p>

<p>I didn't have automated sampling equipment in my primary lab (ie my home), so the actual test jigs looked a lot more primitive then you might expect:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/dmm_array.jpeg" alt="" height="1000" width="1563"></p>

<p>I also followed some tangents into making the other components of ICs, such as resistors, using easily available materials and methods that were somewhat analogous to actual IC masking processes.  Here is an example using a mixture of tube-silicone (used on gutters &amp; bathrooms) and powdered graphite (used as lock lubricant) to make resistors:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/maskup_small.jpeg" alt="" height="424" width="786"> </p>

<p>These resistors were pressure sensitive, so I imagine they could make interesting sensors.  Depending on graphite concentration and track geometry I was able to get anything from hundreds of ohms to megaohms:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/subs_resistors_small.jpeg" alt="" height="671" width="693"></p>

<p>Mal-forming the oxide/hydroxide layers on aluminium contacts would lead to …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://paperless.blog/2009/12/25/vcard-parser-and-validator/">vCard 3.0 validator</a> is ten years old. The standard has moved on, Python has moved on, and I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two as a developer. But I'm not working on any vCard validators, and probably won't be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system syndrome</a>, but I've tried to reboot the project at least three times now. The Python code isn't very elegant, fast or well tested. I set up skeletons in <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard/tree/master/javcard">Java version</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard-rust">Rust</a>, both excellent languages. I tried defining an <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">ANTLR grammar</a>. But I've got nothing to show for any of that. The main problem is motivation: vCard 3, 4 and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a> are incredibly out of date, to the point where writing a parser is equal parts painful and boring.</p>
<p><img src="https://paperless.blog/assets/images/standards.png" alt="standards" width="500" height="283"></p>
<p>And now, because the Internet needs more opinions (and standards): a human friendly address card format is possible. vCard/jCard is not it. When someone brave and tenacious enough to take this on comes around, I really hope they take at least the following into account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a <strong>popular, existing serialization format.</strong> JSON won in this space. It's not perfect, but it's here to stay and it's a good compromise between human and machine readable.</li>
    <li>Don't create another jCard. If you were developing the world's first address card format, what would users and developers want to see?</li>
    <li>Conversely, vCard did many things right. <strong>UTF-8, base64 and ISO dates</strong> are definitely good things.</li>
    <li>All caps is hard to read. Don't shout.</li>
    <li>Don't limit (or even recommend) a line length or line splitting scheme. Address cards shouldn't be inlined into emails or documents any more than CSV files.</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> (as in associated key/value pairs) are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Lists</strong> are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred name</strong> should probably be the only required name field.</li>
    <li><strong>Time zones are not UTC offsets.</strong> I do not live in time zone "+12:00", because that offset changes twice per year. I live in time zone "Pacific/Auckland". This can be the difference between being on time and wasting everybody's time.</li>
    <li>Allow <strong>linking to photos.</strong> Sure URLs are ephemeral, but so is basically everything in an address card.</li>
    <li><strong>Any property not in the standard should simply be ignored,</strong> as long as the entire document is still a valid instance of the serialization format.</li>
    <li><strong>Internationalization and localization</strong> are complex but important.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will such a standard look like? Maybe something like this will be possible:</p>
<pre>{
    "preferred name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": {
        "cell": ["+99 9999-9999", "+11 0000 0000"],
        "home": "+99 9999-9999"
    },
    "URL": {
        "blog": "https://…",
        "work": ["https://example.org/", "https://example.com/"]
    },
    "photo": "https://…",
    "my custom property": "…",
    "time zone": "Pacific/Auckland"
}
