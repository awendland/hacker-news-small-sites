We design building toys, plush animals, and active play toys. We manufacture them in Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and the USA (not as much as we’d like), and then we sell them mainly online.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_14361"><div><p>The desire to get more sales off-Amazon doesn’t just come from the risk that they suspend our company from their platform. It’s also about the cost of selling there relative to other channels. If we sell $100 worth of product on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/viahart">our Amazon store</a>, on average, we get $48.25 back. At <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=viahart&amp;redirect=false">our Walmart.com store</a>, we get $54.50 and on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/viahart">eBay store</a>, we get $57.50 back. On <a href="https://viahart.com/">our website (which could use a bath!)</a>, by virtue of not having a commission and by having much lower per unit shipping costs driven by larger orders (the more you ship, the cheaper it is to ship per unit), we get $83.10 back!</p><p>What’s driving those cost differences between the big marketplaces Amazon, eBay, and Walmart? It’s not shipping. It costs us roughly the same to ship out of our warehouse as it does for us to use Amazon’s FBA. eBay’s has slightly lower commissions, but the main reasons for the cost differences between these marketplaces are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Refunds - It could be Amazon’s customer service or perhaps the customers themselves, but Amazon grants more refunds (2.6% of revenue) than either Walmart (1.9%) or famously seller friendly eBay (1%)</p></li><li><p>Storage - It costs a lot of money to store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. We spent 2.4% of our Amazon revenue on storage. Amazon’s service was very spotty this year, but being able to reach 99.99% of America within 1-2 days is pretty awesome and this is a big driver of why Amazon owns 93.4% of our sales.</p></li><li><p>Advertising - Depending on what website A/B testing they’re doing, as many as 6 out of the top 7 results in an Amazon search can be advertising.  Even when a customer searches for your brand, if you want to be seen before your competition, you need to pay Amazon. We paid them 3.55% of our Amazon revenue in 2020. As less competitive marketplaces, we did not see the need to pay for advertising on eBay or Walmart. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_20928"><div>

At that level of margin, moving your sales from Amazon to eBay would result in a 38% improvement in profits, which is huge. Shifting those sales from Amazon to one’s own website would represent a more than 3x increase in profits! Of course, if this were easy, we would have done it already. Unfortunately, getting traffic to one’s website is oftentimes a costly affair and it could be expected that a good portion of those profits would go to Facebook or Google.</p><p>Logistics and Covid-19 or Why It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good</p><p>When the lockdowns first hit in the United States, it caused a massive shift in spending from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. When government assistance arrived, it turbocharged online consumer spending even further. So for almost everyone in the e-commerce industry, 2020 was the best year they’ve ever had.</p><p>That said, it was a logistics nightmare, all year. And as a result, the rewards of this e-commerce boom were not spread evenly across all channels throughout the year.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_31343"><div>

From 11/27/2020 through 12/31/2020 sales were up only 20% over 2019’s same period. From 12/15/2020 through the end of the year, our sales in 2020 were lower than they were in 2019.

One way to establish social proof is to have a lot of reviews for your item. Again, it’s not just the quality of the reviews, but the quantity that is important to customers trying to make a decision. Our older items had a lot of reviews, given that they had been sold since 2014. However, Amazon implemented a change. They’ve lowered the bar to reviewing, by offering the new rating feature.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="32.077625570776256" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_52634"><div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>

Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

<p>The first publication of the first VideoLAN NuGet package dates back to April 1st, 2018 (no joke!). We have been steadily adding new packages since then to cover all platforms supported by both LibVLC and .NET.</p>

<p>Today, we actively publish and maintain <strong>15 NuGet packages</strong>, 6 of which  actually containing native platform-specific code. The remaining 9 packages are managed C# DLLs composed of the main binding (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp/">LibVLCSharp</a>) and various GUI toolkit integrations for getting users up and running quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xamarin.Android</li>

<p>LibVLCSharp counts about <strong>19 contributors</strong>, with most people doing one-off contributions and mainly 2 active maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyVignelles">Jérémy</a> and myself). I’d like to thank each of them for their valuable OSS contributions!</p>



<p>Many exciting things! More game engine integrations, ongoing LibVLC 4 support, interop performance improvements and plenty of new integrations, samples and features are yet to be implemented.</p>

<p>We have a diverse and (mostly) well-defined <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/issues">backlog</a> of both features to implement and bugs to fix, with a varying degree of difficulty, and always welcome new contributors. We are available on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF">LibVLC community Discord server</a> (320+ members).</p>

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<li><strong>Optimized OLTP</strong>—storage is optimized for high I/O transaction database workloads. Each database instance can support up to 30,000 IOPS.</li>
<li><strong>General purpose</strong>—cost effective hardware offering 3 IOPS per stored GB.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong>&nbsp;improves on the performance of standard MySQL by 5x, and improves on standard PostgreSQL by 2x, with the same hardware configuration. Aurora is a new database engine built to make the most of available compute capacity, memory, and network bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> can provision storage up to 6TB, on-demand without downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> automatically increases storage from a minimum of 10 GB to a maximum of 64 TB, in increments of 10 GB, based on current usage—you do not need to pre-configure storage. Storage scaling does not affect database performance.</p>
<p>However, for MySQL, Aurora only supports the InnoDB storage engine. Tables are automatically converted if they use another storage engine.</p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS </strong>allows up to five live database copies, known as read replicas. RDS failover is done manually, so some data loss may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> also provides read replicas, which share the same data volume as the original database instance. Up to 15 read replicas are supported. Failover is done fully automatically with no data loss. It also supports creating a highly available database cluster with synchronous replication across multiple availability zones.</p>
<h3>Backup</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> performs a daily snapshot of your database, and saves transaction logs to allow point-in-time recovery. The snapshot occurs during a backup window you can specify. While the snapshot is being taken, storage I/O may be interrupted while data is copied, affecting database performance. Backups are saved to S3 with very high durability.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> backups are continuous, incremental backups that do not affect database performance. Also, there is no need to take frequent snapshots to enable point in time recovery.</p>
<h2 id="sub_3">Amazon RDS or Aurora? Factors to Consider Before Choosing</h2>
<p>We covered a feature by feature comparison of the two database services. Here are some other important considerations before you select the service that is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Especially for production databases, <a href="https://cloudian.com/guides/backup-cloud-storage/data-backup-in-depth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data backup </a>is a critical consideration. Aurora offers higher availability and better resilience than RDS, due to its unique storage model, and ability to perform continuous backups and restore with a very low recovery point objective (RPO).</p>
<p><strong>Database engine support</strong></p>
<p>Aurora only supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. If you need to run other database engines, such as SQL Server, you will need to opt for RDS.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>Aurora is generally more expensive than RDS for the same workloads. RDS is priced based on type and size of instance and EBS volume. Aurora pricing is mainly based on instance size and storage is billed according to actual usage. Keep in mind read replicas represent an extra cost in both platforms.</p>
<h2 id="sub_4">AWS Aurora and RDS with Thundra</h2>
<p>Thundra provides deep insights into the microservice applications. Todays’ distributed applications are developed and served on the cloud, and modern tools like Thundra enable developers to trace their apps and debug the code easily. Thundra instruments in a plug and play fashion and automatically traces the requests made to Aurora and RDS databases. You can understand what the query is and the duration of the query made to the database. Thundra provides data privacy by enabling the users to mask their sensitive data inside the calls. <a href="https://blog.thundra.io/which-database-should-i-choose-for-my-serverless-applications" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check this blog post</a> where we discuss which database to choose for cloud applications.</p></span>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code.

<hr>

<p>Email is a powerful tool that is an inextricable part of everyone’s lives.
Despite countless valiant efforts to kill it and replace it with something
better, email continues to live on in more or less the same form it has had
since the 1990s. Technology that endures this long deserves a fair amount of
attention and praise.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why email continues to be useful today. It is simple
to use, and it is not owned or controlled by a single company. Every attempted
replacement has failed at excelling in either one or both of those qualities.
Simple tools can often be extended in ways that the original authors never could
have imagined in the beginning. And because users are in control of the core
functionality, new use cases can be explored completely independently.</p>

<p>Computer users have a tendency to over-generalize when solving problems. In
other words, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In
this post, we are going to be looking at a lot of nails that can probably be
hammered down with email. At a fundamental level, email clients are tools
designed for storing and retrieving sequences of messages which can contain
arbitrary data. Looking at it this way, it is not difficult to imagine a variety
of use cases that can be accomplished with minimal amounts of scripting.</p>

<p>I do seriously think that email is a solid tool for a lot of these purposes, and
in fact use it as such for a few of these purposes every day. However, the main
purpose of this post is exploration, not general advice.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list-one-that-you-actually-check">To-Do List (One That You Actually Check)</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/todo-list.png" alt="To-Do List"></p>

<p>The first use case is pretty obvious, and it is one that likely a large number of
people already employ on a daily basis.</p>

<p>By far the single most important productivity discovery that I made in my life
is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz">Inbox Zero</a>. Inbox Zero is
the simple idea that your email inbox should contain only a list of messages
that require some sort of action. Once the action associated with those messages
is completed, the message is archived or moved to a different folder. I have
been using Inbox Zero for years now and I rarely forget to do anything
important after integrating it into my life.</p>

<p>Need to remember to pack for your flight next week? You probably already got a
confirmation about your reservation in your email. Leave it in your inbox until
you are finished preparing for your trip, and archive it when you are done.</p>

<p>How about one-off reminders that are not associated with messages already in
your inbox? Just send an email to yourself with the action item in the subject
line. Use the body of the message to write down any notes you want, and reply to
the message to keep a record of additional notes if you need them.</p>

<p>What about periodic reminders that repeat on some interval, like reminding
yourself to pay a bill on time every month? Write a simple script that sends you
an email about it and schedule it to run once a month. At the end of each month,
you will have a new to-do item in your inbox with an actionable task in the
subject line.</p>

<p>The great part about using email as a to-do list is that you are already
checking it with some degree of regularity. Smartphone apps or web-based to-do
lists quickly lose their value the moment users lose interest or switch to using
something else. They also frequently become buggy or overburdened with features
that don’t add any value. This will never be a problem with email because you
can always use your favorite client as long as it continues to work with the
standard protocols. Syncing across multiple devices is a given, since your email
is already doing this.</p>

<h2 id="news-reader">News Reader</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/rss2email.png" alt="RSS"></p>

<p>RSS is a really elegant and simple way to subscribe to a feed of updates from
your favorite websites. Since the early 2000s, RSS has been integrated into a
lot of different services all across the net, and serves as the foundation for a
variety of different web-based content platforms such as podcasts.</p>

<p>In order to actually use RSS, you need a client that is capable of aggregating
entries from multiple different feeds and displaying them in some manner.
Managing a list of entries, tracking read or unread state, and displaying HTML
content is exactly what every email client is already good at doing.</p>

<p>I like using <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a> for this.
rss2email delivers stories from my feeds into a special mailbox on my email
server that I check approximately every morning. Since the end result is just
IMAP messages stored on my email server, I can read them using my favorite
email client on whatever device I happen to be using that day.</p>



<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/update-blog.png" alt="Updating a Blog"></p>

<p>Setting up a frictionless workflow for updating your personal website can be
rather difficult, especially if you want to be able to do it while on-the-go and
away from your usual workstation.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining a blog on a personal website or for a business, the focus
should primarily be on the content itself and not on writing markup, updating a
source control repository, or publishing static content to a file server or
database. At the end of the day, you want to be able to write your content in a
message and send it to your server to publish.</p>

<p>Writing rich-text or plain-text content, saving drafts, and publishing that
content to a server is the perfect job for an email client. Your email client
can even allow including inline images sent as attachments, or links that point
to other websites. Once you are done writing your post, send it to a special
email address that activates a script on the other end to convert your email
message into a blog post. <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">PGP</a>
can be used by both the client and the server to ensure that it is actually you
who is authoring the blog post and not someone else. Forget about OAuth or
anything more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Social media feeds can be updated in a similar manner. All of your server-side
functionality can be multiplexed using different email addresses for each
service. For example, you can use <code>blog@mydomain.com</code> to send updates to your
blog, and <code>mastodon@mydomain.com</code> to publish toots on your
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> account. Writing the code for this is a
breeze, since your favorite programming language already has libraries for
dealing with SMTP and IMAP.</p>

<h2 id="a-user-interface-to-a-search-engine-or-database">A User Interface to a Search Engine or Database</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple to build an API for a web service these days. However,
choosing the right library or designing the right API can sometimes be an
unnecessary burden when working on a personal project that only has one or two
users.</p>

<p>Email can be used as an interface between a user and a web service when the
input and output are simple enough.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you have a file server with a large amount of photos
stored on it and you want to be able to search those photos and retrieve them at
random. The server could use machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow to
categorize the photos and attach metadata on them.</p>

<p>Instead of building a custom web-based user interface for this, you could use
email instead. The user sends an email with the search term in the subject line,
such as “pizza”, to a special email address that corresponds to the file server
containing the photos. Just like in the previous example, PGP or S-MIME can be
used as an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can
access the photos being requested. Once the server has collected a search
result, it replies to the query email with matching photos attached as MIME
parts. The email server keeps a record of previous queries, along with their
returned results as replies, in an easily displayable and searchable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-only-limit-is-your-imagination">The Only Limit is Your Imagination</h2>

<p>Connecting email accounts to small shell scripts is a simple but powerful
concept that can unlock a wide variety of different applications. You can build
these apps with the comforting knowledge that they are all based on federated
and robust protocols used by hundreds of different email clients which have
stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Using the rich text editing features of your email client, combined with a
hierarchical organization system based on folders, allows you to do a lot of
tasks that have previously been accomplished using buggy and monolithic tools.
Privacy and security issues that plague web-based tools can be effectively
avoided when using email, because you are in control of both the client and
the server. You also get syncing to multiple devices for free, since IMAP was
designed to facilitate managing email from multiple clients at once since the
beginning.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in learning about new uses of email. If you know about
some of these yourself, send me an email about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>This is a video of The Action Lab’s James Orgill painting the entire interior of a room he made out of insulation board with the world’s blackest commercially available paint, Musou black, which absorbs 99.4% of light. He then turns on an overhead light bulb to see what it looks like inside. It looks…weird. My eyes did not like that. Of course my eyes don’t like much besides being closed and napping if we’re being perfectly honest. Although occasionally they do request I push on them really hard with the fleshy parts of my palms below the thumbs until I get a headache and see all sorts of painful colors and patterns, but that’s rare. </p>
<p>Keep going for the video, the reveal and experimenting begins at 3:30.</p>

        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10
11
2
3
...
9

// Numerical sort
1

...
9
10
11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.

12</code></pre>
        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10
...
2019-12-28
...
2020-08-26
...</code></pre>
        
        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>
              <p id="5003f170-c3f9-4e52-a674-1018970c3f16"><a target="_blank" href="https://observablehq.com/@dgreensp/implementing-fractional-indexing">Fractional sorting</a> is a very related and interesting topic as well.</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>^ One is not affiliated with Simple in any way.</p><p>With the recent Simple closing news, many users were left scrambling to look for a new home. You aren’t stranded or alone; we’re here to welcome you all to One! There have been many questions and requests coming into One, so we gathered all the ones Simple users have asked the most.</p><h3>How does a Simple account compare to a One Pocket?</h3><p>At One, Pockets hold your money. When you create your One account your money will be stored in Pockets, similar to how they were organized at Simple.</p><p>When you first get started, you’ll have a few default Pockets. A Pocket for spending: Spend Pocket, another for savings: Save Pocket and you’ll have a special Pocket to automatically save: Auto-Save Pocket. <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#autosave">The Auto-Save Pocket</a> will need to be toggled “on” but it’s there, ready to be used.</p><p>Easily create free and unlimited Pockets around your life and your people. There’s no limit to how many Pockets you can create in your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/">One account</a>. Each pocket has its own account and routing number, so you can transfer funds directly in and out of Pockets from external sources (example: to pay bills).&nbsp; You can also share individual Pockets with other One users. You’ll also have the flexibility to choose which Pocket is debited when you use your One card by assigning your card to it in the One app. Adjust what Pocket your card points to at any time!</p><p>P.S. We’re actively working on new upgrades to One that will include enhanced features similar to Simple’s Safe-to-Spend and Expenses and Goals.</p><h3>Does One connect to Mint?</h3><p>At the moment, One is not available with Mint but is available on any budgeting tool that utilizes the Plaid exchange network.</p><h3>When will Mint add One?</h3><p>Mint prioritizes what financial institutions to add based on user demand. If you’d like to see One work with Mint, please follow below for a step-by-step guide on how to request it directly with the Mint team.</p><p>Mint users can request One to be added by:</p><ol><li>Logging into your Mint account through their desktop website. The app does not support requesting a new bank.</li><li>Click “+ Add Accounts” button on the top navigation bar.</li><li>Type in a few random letters (typing “One Finance” here will result in hundreds of incorrect results).</li><li>Click “Request support for your bank” button.</li><li>Type “One Finance” in the Bank name field.</li><li>Copy and paste our website URL into the bank web address field: <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">https://www.onefinance.com</a></li><li>That’s it!</li></ol><p>We appreciate your support and hope to move up in the line fast if enough requests for One come through!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png" alt="" width="5136" height="1401" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-300x82.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1024x279.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1536x419.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-2048x559.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1600x436.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h3>Does One offer joint accounts?</h3><p>One offers something even better, Pocket sharing! You can create and share as many Pockets as you’d like with any One user(s). This feature helps you get hyper-organized with your finances especially with the ability to slice and dice your finances so you can control who and what Pocket you share. For example: partners can each have their own separate One account but share one or more Pockets with each other for shared expenses like rent, groceries, car payments etc. They’ll both be able to access only the funds within the Shared Pockets while their main One account funds stay separate. Ditch the constant requests for bill splitting and continually ping ponging money back and forth through another app.</p><h3>Can I move money between Pockets? How long does it take? Is there a limit to the amount of transfers?</h3><p>Yes! It’s easy to move money between Pockets under the “Move Money” tab in the One App. It’s instant, and there’s no limit to the amount of transfers that can be done between your Pockets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png" alt="" width="4608" height="2836" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png 4608w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-300x185.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1024x630.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1536x945.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1600x985.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4608px) 100vw, 4608px"></p><h3>What does APY and APR mean? <b>Why does One have higher rates than other brands?</b></h3><p>The Annual Percentage Yield, or “APY”, is a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of interest paid to you on your account. Our APYs are based on the interest rates we offer and how often interest compounds (interest on the amounts you contribute plus any interest you have already earned).</p><p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the amount you pay each year to borrow money, including fees, expressed as a percentage.</p><p>One is able to offer higher rates because as a digital banking service we don’t have the traditional overhead that brick and mortar banks have. Instead of keeping the cost savings, we put it back into our product offerings, such as the 3.00% APY* One users enjoy in their Auto-Save Pocket, and the 1.00% APY* we provide on existing savings balances (up to $25k for our paycheck direct deposit customers). We’re able to maintain these industry-leading rates to our customers for two primary reasons. First, we focus on generating revenue through interchange (essentially card spending activity, which is driven by the expense that businesses pay to accept credit and debit cards) and fairly priced credit and lending, instead of fees like traditional banks. Second, our savings products are designed to help build, and rebuild, financial wellness, a big component of which is emergency savings and a cushion for unexpected expenses. For customers with very large existing savings balances looking for a place to park their money just to earn returns, we may not be the best option, and that is okay. We are focused on helping to improve and maintain financially healthy habits for our customers, while offering the most compelling and best priced spending, saving and credit options in the market.</p><h3>Can a One account receive a wire transfer?</h3><p>Yes! All One accounts can accept wire transfers but are not able to send wire transfers. One accounts can also receive international wire transfers. Please <a href="https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact</a> our team for additional information needed to accept an international transfer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png" alt="" width="5136" height="2387" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-300x139.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1024x476.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1536x714.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-2048x952.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1600x744.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h2>Your feedback is our fuel | One updates coming soon</h2><p><span>There’s been a lot of great feedback from Simple users and we’re actively listening, combing through every post and working to update One. Our team is reprioritizing to make sure we fill in the biggest gaps first so our new friends from Simple can feel less anxiety and regain their financial peace of mind. Here’s a quick list of top requested updates (in no particular order) and how we’re approaching them:</span></p><h3>Recurring Transfers</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>You’ll recognize this feature as “funding schedule.” It’s automating the funding of expenses and goals. We completely agree this is a feature One needs STAT. Manually allocating funds whenever new money lands in your One account is not fun.</p><p>Right now, you can allocate up to 10% of your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/direct-deposit/">paycheck direct deposit</a> (up to $1,000/month) to automatically deposit into your Auto-Save Pocket. You’ll earn 3.00% APY* in the Auto-Save Pocket.</p><p>Our team imagines that an early version of the recurring transfers feature will allow a user to set similar rules for what money ends up in which created Pocket. Example: $100 to Grocery Pocket on the 3rd of every month.</p><h3>Virtual Cards For Every Pocket</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch first pass in Q1</p><p>This feature will help One users who have a very tight management around their recurring expenses. You’ll be able to set up dedicated Pockets, each with a unique virtual card number to pay these recurring bills. Example: a dedicated card to pay for your “Streaming TV” Pocket bill only. We’re also planning to support these cards later in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet to make spending even easier.</p><h3>Configurable Overdraft</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launching Q1</p><p>Currently, the only Pocket that has overdraft protection is the default Spend Pocket. This Pocket comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#creditLine">Credit Line</a> in case your account dips below zip. We’re currently working on allowing any created Pocket to be auto-filled by available funds in the Spend Pocket when funds aren’t available to fill the transaction in the other Pocket. This update will take a lot of guesswork out of bill payments, including payments that have different amounts each month.</p><h3>MFA/2FA</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>We recognize that multi-factor authentication is an important security feature and are actively working to get this up and running.</p><h3>Remote Check Deposit</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch in February</p><p>Grandparents send checks, the landlord still wants a check, work pays you with a check…love them or hate them checks are still a part of daily banking. The ability to deposit checks with your mobile device is in the works.</p><h3>Mail A Check</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Coming soon!</p><p>We will soon support the ability to “cut a check” all within the One app. Users will be able to fill in the details and we’ll handle the printing and mailing of the physical check, free of charge! This feature will be in lieu of traditional paper checkbooks. Let’s be honest, those thick books just collect dust in a drawer and only have 1 or 2 taken out anyway.</p><p>We’re excited to bring these features to life, and know they’ll be a huge step towards getting you back to the kind of stress-free workflows you worked so hard to fine-tune over the years with Simple. Thank you so much for all your feedback! We can’t stress this part enough…keep it coming! With your help, we can continue to constantly improve One.</p> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Here’s a transcript from Tim Ferriss’s interview with Marcus Aurelius:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tim: Thanks for joining me, Marcus. Or should I use your title: Caesar?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: You may call me Marcus. I do not stand on ceremony.</p>
<p>Tim: Fair enough. So, I want to start at the beginning. What is Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: Stoicism is a philosophy of life. It is a way of looking at the world. It is about seeing clearly what is in front of us and feeling what is in our hearts. It is about doing what is right, no matter what the cost. It is about living according to nature and treating others with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what is the goal of Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: The goal of Stoicism is to live a good life, a life in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>Tim: What does that mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means doing what we ought to do, not doing what we want to do. It means acting rationally, not emotionally.</p>
<p>Tim: Ok, so how do we do that?</p>
<p>Marcus: By paying attention to what is in our power and not worrying about the rest.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means we have control over our actions, our judgments, and our feelings. It means we can choose how we respond to events outside of our control. It means we can choose what to think.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, how do you apply Stoicism to life?</p>
<p>Marcus: By facing the world with a smile and acting with justice, kindness, and honesty.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that too. So, can you give me an example?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: These are obstructions.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great passage. So, how do we deal with adversity?</p>
<p>Marcus: By recognizing that it is nothing more than what it is: a thing that can be endured.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s hard.</p>
<p>Marcus: It is, but it is also liberating.</p>
<p>Tim: How do you mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: The things that cause us suffering are those that are out of our control. Death, illness, poverty, dishonor, slander, and all such things. If you accept that they are fated to happen, they will lose their power over you.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a powerful idea. So, how do we deal with pain?</p>
<p>Marcus: The first step is recognizing that pain is an opinion, not a fact. The second is accepting that it can’t be changed. The third is being thankful that it isn’t worse.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great way of putting it. So, what’s the best way to deal with other people?</p>
<p>Marcus: Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</p>
<p>Tim: What about those who are unkind?</p>
<p>Marcus: They are like children, who are unkind not by choice but because they don’t know better.</p>
<p>Tim: How do we deal with external events that we can’t control?</p>
<p>Marcus: We accept that we have no control over them.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. I have a question. I’ve heard it said that Stoicism is a cold and emotionless philosophy.</p>
<p>Marcus: That’s not true. Stoics feel all the emotions—they just don’t allow those emotions to determine their behavior.</p>
<p>Tim: So, you’re saying that Stoics don’t repress their emotions?</p>
<p>Marcus: No. The Stoic does not indulge her emotions, but she feels them fully and completely.</p>
<p>Tim: What about death?</p>
<p>Marcus: Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not yet present. And when death is present, then we no longer exist. It doesn’t concern us at all.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer. So, can you sum up Stoicism for me?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. I can tell you that it is the art of living. It is about seeing clearly, doing good, and facing adversity. It is about accepting what cannot be changed and freeing yourself from the things that cause you suffering. It is about being strong and kind. It is about seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: I like that. For a small change of topic, there are a few questions I like to ask. As you may know I’m a huge fan of books and read dozens of them every year. What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of biographies, especially those of the great philosophers and statesmen. I like to read about how others have dealt with adversity and challenges. I also love history books, especially those of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. What about books you’ve read recently that you would recommend?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve been reading The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It’s about how to turn obstacles into advantages.</p>
<p>Tim: That sounds good. I’ll check it out. What about books that have greatly influenced your life?</p>
<p>Marcus: The Enchiridion by Epictetus.</p>
<p>Tim: I guess you like Roman philosophers. What about favorite quotes?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have many favorites.</p>
<p>Tim: Give me some.</p>
<p>Marcus: “It is difficult to fight against one’s natural impulses.”</p>
<p>“Accept life as it comes.”</p>
<p>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>
<p>“How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.”</p>
<p>Tim: I like those. What about favorite movies or TV shows?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of many of the HBO series, such as Rome, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of the Moleskine notebooks. I just ordered the new “junior” version.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I failed at many things early in my life. I failed as a student, as an athlete, and as a politician. I failed as a husband and a father. But each failure taught me something about myself and the world. I learned from these failures and became a better man for it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Travel. I’ve visited many countries and have learned much from others.</p>
<p><strong>Tim:What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I love to swim. I’ve done it every day for years.</p>
<p>Tim: What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have no talent for drinking. I must therefore leave it alone.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what’s a personal habit that contributes to your success?</p>
<p>Marcus: I write in a journal every single day</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve adopted a no-complaining policy. I used to complain all the time about everything. This doesn’t mean I don’t have complaints—it means I keep them to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Educate yourself. Read as much as you can. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. Don’t waste time on jealousy or resentment. Don’t let your emotions control you. Find a cause that is bigger than yourself and devote yourself to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “Your gut doesn’t matter.” You must learn to trust your gut and use it to navigate the world.</p>
<p>“It’s too late for this.”</p>
<p>“You’re too old for that.”</p>
<p>“You’ll never be able to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve learned that it’s better to give a small amount of time to many people than a lot of time to a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I take a break and do some exercise. Then, I get back to work.</p>
<p>Tim: If you were to start again, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>Marcus: I would have studied philosophy much earlier in life. It has changed everything for me.</p>
<p>Tim: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? (There’s no right answer. I’m just curious.)</p>
<p>Marcus: I would like to be able to read other people’s minds. I’m pretty good at understanding what others are thinking, but I’d like to be able to read their thoughts directly.</p>
<p>Tim: One last question: What does success mean to you?</p>
<p>Marcus: Finding a purpose larger than yourself and devoting your life to it.</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Marcus, I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Marcus: It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>If you liked this conversation, I think you’ll like my book, Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers. In the book I deconstruct world-class performers’ routines and habits you can apply to your</p>

<p>Hello 👋&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you like to use WhatsApp, I use WhatsApp as well. One of the most important things in WhatsApp that differentiates itself from other messaging apps like Viber, Messenger and Telegram is WhatsApp’s privacy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted. Which means once you hit the send button on your phone, WhatsApp scrambles the message so no one in the middle can read it, not even WhatsApp themselves can read what you send. Therefore called end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>You get this feature as soon as you install and start using WhatsApp, while you need to enable end-to-end encryption on other chat apps that you use (Telegram, Messenger etc). So you are at risk of the app creator, your government reading your messages.</p>

<p><strong>However, starting&nbsp;from February 8th, WhatsApp is changing is policies, to loosen some of it’s privacy features because Facebook (the company that owns WhatsApp) plans to make money out of WhatsApp.<p>This including sharing your data with advertisers, companies, and businesses that might chat on WhatsApp.</p></strong></p>
<p>You might have already got this message asking you to agree to these new terms, and if you agree with it, you are agreeing to share your data with other companies.</p>

<p>Even though we are not sure whether WhatsApp or businesses can read your messages or not after the&nbsp;February 8th&nbsp;because the message is very vague, this update coming&nbsp;on February 8th&nbsp;means that&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp is not safe anymore, and should not to be used for private communications.</strong></p>
<h2>Why use Signal?</h2>
<p>Signal is a chat app, just like WhatsApp. But unlike WhatsApp Signal is a non profit organization, which meansSignal does not have to sell your messages and information to advertisers like WhatsApp is planning to do in order to make money.<br>Signal also enables end-to-end encryption by default, so your chats are safe just like WhatsApp.<br>People like Elon Musk and others have asked everyone to switch to Signal once WhatsApp announced their new privacy policy about selling your data.</p>

<h2>What you miss by using signal instead of WhatsApp?</h2>
<p><strong>Basically nothing.&nbsp;</strong>Signal has everything that you love in WhatsApp.</p>
<ul><li>Groups ✅</li><li>Voice calls ✅&nbsp;</li><li>Video calls ✅</li><li>Stickers ✅</li><li>Statuses 🅾️</li></ul>
<p>You won’t miss anything by using Signal instead of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>So I suggest everyone to download and try Signal, hopefully you will be able to replace WhatsApp if you care about your privacy, and may be try switching your friends over to Signal</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Download Signal</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/download/">https://signal.org/download/</a></li><li><strong>Signal for iOS</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms</a></li><li><strong>Signal for Android devices</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669">https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669</a></li></ul>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

    <figcaption>Unfolded Studio - The Platform for Geospatial Analytics</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Today we are delighted to officially unveil <a href="https://studio.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded Studio</a>,
our take on what the next generation geospatial analytics and visualization platform should look like.</p><p>We, the Unfolded founding team, originally met at Uber around 2015 as we started building out what has now become a suite of
leading open source geospatial technologies, including kepler.gl, deck.gl and H3. </p><p>By 2019, theis this technology stack had become quite mature,
and we realized that an extraordinary geospatial platform
could be built on top of it, so we came together to found Unfolded,
a new geospatial company with a mission to build the next generation of geospatial analytics.</p><p>Our mission is to enable effortless geospatial and temporal data analytics at
massive, planetary scales, and to share insights through geospatial visualizations
that inspire with their beauty and fluidity.</p><h2>Why Geospatial Platforms?</h2><p>Geospatial datasets are unique among data sets, in that they can be presented
in the context of maps and the physical world, rather than just as abstract graphs.
This makes it possible for viewers to quickly comprehend and draw valuable insights
from datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than would normally be possible.</p><p>Unfortunately visualizing data on maps is complicated. Ingesting, processing
and interacting with geospatial datasets is computationally and
technically demanding, especially when datasets become large,
and users typically need to solve numerous problems before insights can be reached. </p><p>For a geospatial platform like Unfolded Studio,
each of these problems represents an opportunity to help our users.</p><h2>Enter Unfolded Studio</h2><p>Our view is that any geospatial analytics platform worth considering today
must offer its users a range of critical core features:</p><ul><li>Effortless map creation</li><li>Strong exploratory visualization</li><li>Powerful geospatial analytics to help users uncover insights</li><li>Seamless cloud storage for geospatial data</li><li>Single-click map publishing </li><li>Easy ingestion of key geospatial data formats</li><li>Automation for getting data into and out of the tool</li><li>Ways to build custom applications on top of maps</li></ul><p>Note that Unfolded Studio is designed to handle not only these core geospatial data management tasks,
but more importantly is architected to address what we consider to be the hard problems in geospatial analytics.
We will share our thoughts and roadmaps around this in a follow-up blog post.</p><h3>Powerful Visualization Layers</h3><figure>

				<p><em>Alternative title: Young NB Yells At The Cloud</em></p>
<p><strong>Note that this absolutely isn’t vetted for technical accuracy.</strong>
<strong>It’s probably also not a very coherent post altogether.</strong>
<strong>I just needed to get this off my chest.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since late 2019, I’ve been using a Google Pixel 2 as my day-to-day
cellphone. While I’ve known that it didn’t respect my privacy, per the Google
tradition of being creepy and generally terrifying, I wasn’t <em>entirely</em> aware of
this phenomenon until Google told me when I registered my rooted Nook Tablet
with their services in 2014. The fact that this has been recorded six years
later was enough to set me off on a path to de-Googlify my Google phone.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/img/2020-01-28-1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>The first option I found was <a href="https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack">RattlesnakeOS</a>, which is basically just AOSP built
on EC2. While it seemed like a competent option, and it likely is, I didn’t want
to set up an AWS account and pay $5/mo to build it, as I’m already paying $10/mo
on my current servers (including the one hosting this website). In addition,
there’s <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, which is the continuation of the ill-fated CopperheadOS
(which effectively died Because Capitalism^TM after CopperheadOS was
commercialized, effectively killing the project altogether). I opted for the
latter as I wouldn’t have to set up my own build infrastructure on AWS, and the
fact that GrapheneOS decidedly had more features directly geared towards a
“hardened” Android experience, regardless of de-Googlification.</p>
<p>This of course, would be wonderful… if not for a critical roadblock.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-unlock-the-bootloader">Trying to unlock the bootloader</h2>
<p>Here’s how it went down:
“Hey, are you able to unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> Λ ~ fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability
(bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
OKAY [  0.000s]
</code></pre><p>(read: “yeah, sure”)</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>can</em> you unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> λ ~ fastboot flashing unlock
FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')
fastboot: error: Command failed
</code></pre><p>(read: “No, because I’m not able to.")</p>
<p>…so I’m left with Schrödinger’s bootloader (and not the cat from Digital Devil
Saga). Wonderful! Furthermore, I’m not the only one with this issue; not only do
some carriers lock down your ability to OEM unlock, but Google Play Services’
anti-theft protection makes it impossible to do so without an internet
connection, <em>and</em> some refurbished Pixel devices (mine being case-in-point) just
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/unlock-bootloader-refurbished-pixel-2-t4017557">don’t cooperate</a>, regardless as to whether or not it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>My experience with Google support on this topic basically boiled down to “why
are you even trying to unlock the bootloader, you idiot”, so that’s out of the
question. I’d imagine they’re probably not super happy about me stealing profits
from them by trying to escape their ecosystem.</p>
<p>On a happier note, I came across this person on Freenode’s channel #grapheneos,
which eased the tension due to them not breaking character:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil">       hazel1 │ hi yes okay so.
       hazel1 │ i'm on a pixel 2 non-xl, `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` returns 1, but `fastboot flashing unlock` says "Flashing Unlock is not allowed"
       hazel1 │ no idea where to go from here.
TheJollyRoger │ Avast! Did ye enable OEM unlocking in the OS under developer options?
       hazel1 │ i did, yes, that's what `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability = 1` meant
       hazel1 │ also i appreciate your dedication to character.
       hazel1 │ i'm on linux, if that's important, and i'm running these commands as root.
TheJollyRoger │ Shiver me timbers, I be stuck too. Maybe someone else on this here tub will know.
</code></pre><h2 id="why-this-is-stupid">Why this is stupid</h2>
<p>This is where I turn this tech rant into a political rant, as I have no
self-control.</p>
<p>Per the majority of things that happen in the modern tech industry, this is, of
course, a byproduct of capitalism. The fact that carriers or refurbishers <em>can</em>
lock you out of customizing your own device is in it of itself terrifying, on
the merit that it’s an effective paywall to gain control of the hardware you own
— or rather, should own. While I’m a firm believer in security, and a firm
believer that the majority of people have devices that work well enough for them
(given that they’re not privacy conscious…), I’m also under the impression
that <em>people should have control over the things they own</em>. Capitalism, in the
name of profit, contradicts that scheme.</p>
<p>The fact that your carrier owns your phone, or your phone manufacturer owns your
phone, or Google owns your phone, etc, applies in bounds here. While the
saying is generally “if it’s free, you’re the product”, the fact that you’re
<strong>still</strong> the product when buying an expensive device speaks volumes about the
technological ecosystems we tend to depend on in 2020. I should be able to
unlock the bootloader without a second thought, but the fact that some
refurbisher owns the rights to do that with the device I should own, and not me,
worries me deeply.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to worry about whether some random thing I say is going to be
used against me in some creepy fashion three weeks later in an ad that shows up
on a torrent site when I’m trying to scrape the web for some obscure piece of
software that nobody uses or some movie that nobody watched.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that this point has been regurgitated. I’m well aware this post
doesn’t actually make much sense. But regardless, I’m scared that Google has
this much control, and I’m scared that I’m unable to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up--2020-01-29--and-a-potential-explanation">Follow-up (2020-01-29) and a potential explanation</h2>
<p>So apparently this is by design, which pretty much confirms my theory. Great.
Per a user on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605?hl=en">Pixel Phone Help “official support forum”:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: I was able to get a reply from the higher levels in Google and they
simply informed the man handling my case, to his astonishment, that the
refurbishment process is intentionally locking the bootloader and that is the
way they designed it to operate. No options were given to me to remedy the
issue and I was asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss before
they ended the call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous if true.</strong> Not only does it compound on my existing complaint
of bootloader unlocks being behind a paywall, which is already ridiculous, but
it means that even <strong>if</strong> you go through a paywall, any device defect could lead
to a permanently locked bootloader (such as my case). Even more ridiculous is
that Google’s factory Pixel images require a bootloader unlock to flash, meaning
that this locks users out of potential support options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the theory of a refurbished device just being an unlocked
carrier edition phone is true (despite my CID being all zeroes), this is just
<em>negligence</em>.</p>
<p>Even if 99.3\% of users should <em>never</em> have to touch this option, the fact that
Google not only sends refurbished phones, but RMAs of unlockable phones with
this defect is astounding. It attests to the fact that what you own is not truly
yours even moreso than this just being a coincidence — it’s an explicit
hostile action towards the privacy-focused by Google. The former glory of Nexus
devices of being “the modder’s phone” has been changed drastically upon a vision
of a more popular “Google phone”; again, driven by capitalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

          <p>We as old community members should also be reminded to be nice even when other people are not nice.<br>
I can talk of myself (and think many other here feel the same) that sometimes when a wave of people hits and behave bad I am angry and I should be nicer to other people.</p>
<p>So to us, even when we have people misbehave and maybe even spaming or other stuff we should still try to be serious and nice to each other :)</p>

        <p>Taking a risk of offending people is not a means to push your opinion. There is no law against it, but there are community guidelines against it.<br>
Pushing the buttons of other people, you full well know that sooner or later you will push a button that triggers something. That’s why we don’t push each others buttons in the first place. you can always make your point without being rude.</p>

          <p>This is a great example of what not to say.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<article>
    <p>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That’s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</p>
<p>We’re going to work with a simplified example for the rest of this article. Imagine your boss has asked you to write a program that will count from 1 to 9 and print out the number, along with if it is even. A valid output would be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">1 is even: False
2 is even: True
3 is even: False
4 is even: True
5 is even: False
6 is even: True
7 is even: False
8 is even: True
9 is even: False
</code></pre></div><p>Your boss might’ve said this would be part of the test suite for the NPM package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">is-even</a> but you stopped listening about halfway through to figure out how many story points this would be on the next sprint.</p>
<p>Oh well, sounds easy enough right? Any developer worth their salt knows a simple for loop could solve this problem.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {i % 2 == 0}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>But as correct as this solution might be, it doesn’t guarantee us job security which is after all the most important principle of good code.</p>
<p>Time to add a little complexity to ensure no one else will dare touch the code, or try to understand it.</p>

<p>Just so we’re all on the same page, a for loop is comprised of a statement, and a body.</p>
<p>The statement is the portion which sits atop the loop and is within parenthesis. It’s divided into three parts. Each of which is separated by a semi-colon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(initializer; condition; iterator) {}
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li>initializer: The initializer is the first part, and usually instantiates a variable. Say <code>int i = 0;</code></li>
<li>condition: The condition is the middle portion and is checked each pass of the loop to ensure it’s true. When the condition tests false, the loop is exited.</li>
<li>iterator: The last portion is the iterator, this is typically used to increment the loop variable ex: <code>i++</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All 3 parts of the statement are optional, and an empty for loop <code>for (; ;) { }</code> will act like an infinite while loop <code>while(1) { }</code>.</p>
<p>The body is the portion of the loop below the statement. Usually surrounded by curly braces, unless it’s one line (as they’re optional then). I should also mention that the body is optional too.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and start writing our <em>ahem</em> abomination.</p>

<p>First off we’ve got some domain logic operating inside the for loop body. The ternary that detects if the number is even: <code>i % 2 == 0</code>. Let’s go ahead and squeeze it into the for statement because after all that’s where it belongs.</p>
<p>We’re going to need an extra variable to hold a <code>isEven</code> flag. But, there’s a bit of a problem. C# only allows for defining multiple variables of the same type in one line. So while the following is perfectly valid:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, b = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>This is not:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, bool isEven = false; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>But that’s okay because we’ll slap it in a value tuple and deconstruct it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>With the bool instantiated we just need to recalculate it each time in the iterator. Thankfully C# is cool with assigning multiple variables of different types on the same line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { }
</code></pre></div><p>And now our for loop body has been devoided of any logic. It’s clean and concise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’d argue <code>i &lt; 10</code> is too readable. Since the condition just needs to be a boolean we can substitute it with anything we please provided it evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Which basically makes it a no-brainer to swap it out with a switch expression.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>The switch expression will still run our loop from 1 to 9 as intended. Each iteration of the loop it’ll see which case it matches i against. The underscore (or discard) is equivalent to the default case of a switch statement. Therefore while i is not 10 it’ll return true which means keep running the loop, and once it hits 10 the switch will return false saying it’s time to stop.</p>
<p>But we can take this a step further and add erroneous cases. As long as the switch never hits said cases it doesn’t mess with the logic.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, 14 =&gt; true, 69 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true,_ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>And on top of that they don’t even have to be in order. Also note that erroneous cases can return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This is extra important to add another layer of confusion.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 =&gt; false, 69 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>For the finishing touch let’s kick it up a notch. A switch case has to be a literal or constant, which removes the usages of methods, and the such but still leaves math on the table.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>I recommend leaving the math a fifth grade level. We want to give the reader a flash back to their day in grade school learning their multiplication tables.</p>
<p>Oh and did I mention we can add some math and more to the return values? After all they just need to be booleans.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not done yet. Our solution is optimal, but everyone knows that a 1 line solution is <strong>always</strong> better. Right now you’re either begging for mercy or thinking there’s no way it’s possible. Even if we removed the brackets it’s still 2 lines.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0)
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
</code></pre></div><p>But if there’s a will there’s a way.</p>
<p>Our next magic trick is going to involve a little inspiration from JavaScript. Have you ever heard of a self invoking function? It’s basically a function declaration that immediately executes itself.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">(function () {
  console.log("foo");
})();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>And while we may be in the .NET world, who’s to say we can’t borrow a little inspiration?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Action(() =&gt; Console.WriteLine("foo"))();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take our new found knowledge and replace the iterator of our loop. Because after all when all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)) {
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the little bit we added.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)
</code></pre></div><p>A Func&lt;&gt; is the same thing as an Action except it can have parameters, and a return value. In our instance, the function takes an int parameter, and returns a value tuple containing an int, and bool. Make sure you name your function parameters the same as the variable being passed in.</p>
<p>The real reason why we added in the self invoking function isn’t to make it more confusing. No. We just needed a new location to place our <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> call.</p>
<p>That my friends is how we can achieve our glorious one liner solution.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)); })(i));

</code></pre></div><p>Here’s the self invoking function for those who somehow have trouble reading our work of art.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0); }(i)
</code></pre></div>
<p>We could take things further, but before doing some I’d recommend assessing the rankings of your co-workers. If you work alongside a lot of junior devs, it’s probably sufficient, but if you work with more senior developers we could always break out a few more tricks. I’ll leave this as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>With everything coded up, and testing good, it’s time to commit your masterpiece and send off some requests for code reviews. Come to think of it it’s probably about time to head on home as this likely took most the day. Go home and enjoy some brews. Because tomorrow when your boss calls you into his office it’s gonna be for that promotion you’ve been wanting.</p>
<p>PS: If anyone is hiring an entry level code obfuscator please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you Chris Cattano for pointing out I had a logic error in the code bits after switching to the self invoking function. The program was incorrectly reporting which numbers were odd. Turns out even I fell prey to the complexity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries/">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather Test CLI" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png"></p><p>Rust has grown on me over the past year. I consumed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a> while on a plane ride in February of last year <em>right</em> before Covid hit. It has basically been all downhill since. 😅</p><p>Since then, i’ve designed a (very alpha) <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/eagle-plm" target="_blank">CLI based MRP system</a>, e-commerce backend for <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/" target="_blank">my static website</a>, CLI based tester and firmware for my nRF9160 Feather test fixture. Yea, all in Rust.</p><p>In this article, i’ll be sharing details about how I developed the CLI and ATSAMD based tester for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf9160-feather/" target="_blank">nRF9160 Feather</a>. By the end this should give you confidence that you can also develop your own firmware and software 100% in Rust!</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="sprinkle-some-rust-in-your-firmware">Sprinkle some Rust in your firmware</h2><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather tester hardware render" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/feather-tester_v14.png" data-src="images/feather-tester_v14.png"></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I designed my tester hardware (pictured above) to use an ATSAMD microcontroller. I had a few reasons why I chose the ATSAMD21:</p><ol><li>It has a <strong>ton</strong> of pins. (ATSAMD21J18A-MFT has 52 to be exact!) This was going to be important in order to connect to and control everything about the DUT (Device under test) in the tester.</li><li>SAMD21 series is also ubiquitous and plentiful elsewhere. It also happens to have great support in the form of the <code>atsamd-hal</code> crate. (<a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li></ol><p>While there is some test firmware on the DUT itself, there’s a bunch of exciting stuff happening on the tester side. But before we do, let’s chat about the bootloader.</p><h3 id="first-thing-you-should-do">First thing you should do</h3><p>After lots of tinkering I realized that one of the first things you should do on any SAMD based project is get the UF2 bootloader loaded. Since loading it onto my test board <strong>I haven’t used my debug probe.</strong> (Rust makes this extremely easy since it eliminates 80% of the stupid mistakes i’d otherwise make in C)</p><p>Here’s a quick primer on how I got my board working:</p><ol><li><p>I cloned the UF2 repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Created a folder called <code>circuitdojo_feather_tester</code> within the <code>boards</code> directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd uf2-samdx1
mkdir boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>I created <code>board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
touch board.mk
touch board_config.h
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Using the already existing boards in the <code>boards</code> folder, updated the contents of <code>http://board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code>. First <code>board.mk</code> to define what chip I was targeting:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">CHIP_FAMILY <span>=</span> samd21
CHIP_VARIANT <span>=</span> SAMD21J18A
</code></pre></div><p>Then <code>board_config.h</code> for all the configuration bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#ifndef BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span>#define BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span></span>
<span>#define VENDOR_NAME "Circuit Dojo"
</span><span>#define PRODUCT_NAME "Feather Tester"
</span><span>#define VOLUME_LABEL "BOOT"
</span><span>#define INDEX_URL "https:</span><span>//www.jaredwolff.com/"
</span><span></span><span>#define BOARD_ID "SAMD21G18A-Feather-v0"
</span><span></span>
<span>#define USB_VID 0x16c0
</span><span>#define USB_PID 0x27dd
</span><span></span>
<span>#define LED_PIN PIN_PA22
</span><span></span>
<span>#endi
</span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Then using the instructions in the Readme, build the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make BOARD<span>=</span>circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div><p>I used the toolchain that comes with NCS v1.4.1. I did have to make a change to the Makefile for everything to compile without borking. Turns out my toolchain was newer than expected. Fortunately adding <code>Wno-deprecated</code> inside the Makefile to the <code>WFLAGS</code> variable fixes this problem.</p></li><li><p>Once complete it will dump your binary/hex files to <code>build/&lt;your board name&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>Then I flashed the bootloader using <code>pyocd</code> like so:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">pyocd flash -t ATSAMD21J18A -f <span>4000000</span> bootloader-circuitdojo_feather_tester-v3.4.0-65-gdf89a1f-dirty.elf --format elf
</code></pre></div><p><code>pyocd</code> is just one of many ways to load firmware. The <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank"><code>atsamd-rs</code> repo</a> has a ton more options.</p></li></ol><p>Once programmed, hit the reset button twice in quick succession to enable bootloader mode. (I believe this is consistent across all other boards using the UF2 bootloader. Correct me if i’m wrong!) This will cause the bootloader to remain active so you can transfer new firmware.</p><p>On a scale from easy to painful, this was defintiely on the easy side of the spectrum. The folks at Microsoft and contributors like Adafruit made this process <em>really simple.</em></p><h3 id="hey-my-name-is-hal">Hey, my name is HAL</h3><p><img alt="Compiling Rust firmware" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png"></p><p>As of this writing, every different hardware platform has some type of independently created HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Atmel’s SAMD differs slightly from nRF and that differs from the STM32s of the world. The nice thing is as long as they conform to the higher level APIs, you can use something like the <a href="https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device" target="_blank">USB crate</a> which supports ATSAMD and STM32.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with your own ATSAMD based board to create your own board definition. You can find a <strong>ton</strong> of example in the <code>boards</code> directory. Many off the shelf boards are already supported which makes for one less thing you need to do!</p><p>If you do find yourself with a custom board, you can copy one of the already existing boards that is closest to yours. For instance I used <code>feather_m0</code> as the base for my tester board. I tweaked <code>memory.x</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> to my liking.</p><p>There’s even a cool way to define pins so you can easily access them later. For for instance if you have a pin named <code>FLASH_EN</code> and it’s mapped to pin port B, pin 8 you can simply reference it later on using the <code>Pins</code> struct like <code>pins.flash_en</code>. (More below..)</p><p>The ATSAMD repo is going through some slow and steady improvements. There are even some nice additions to the <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/pull/371" target="_blank">board support</a> area that i’m excited about and testing. While it’s mostly useable, it is rough in some areas (especially related to documentation).</p><p><em>Big shoutout to Bradley who has been spearheading these improvements. If I were to do any of this, i’d be surprised it would be working by then of it.</em> 😅</p><h3 id="dont-be-unsafe">Don’t be <code>unsafe</code></h3><p>When I first started developing the test firmware, I notice that I was using <code>unsafe</code> a lot. While in hardwareland using <code>unsafe</code> is not uncommon, from a readability and risk for increased errors perspective, it can get hairy.</p><p>There is a cool solution around this and that’s where <code>rtic</code> enters the picture. <code>rtic</code> is a new spin on how to write firmware in Rust. Instead of having the familiar <code>main</code> function, it works differently. Here’s the features from <a href="https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic" target="_blank">the Github page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tasks</strong>&nbsp;as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be&nbsp;<em>event triggered</em>&nbsp;(fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.</li><li><strong>Message passing</strong>&nbsp;between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.</li><li><strong>A timer queue</strong>&nbsp;[^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.</li><li>Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus,&nbsp;<strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>.</li><li><strong>Efficient and data race free memory sharing</strong>&nbsp;through fine grained&nbsp;<em>priority based</em>&nbsp;critical sections [^1].</li><li><strong>Deadlock free execution</strong>&nbsp;guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger guarantee than what’s provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html" target="_blank">the standard&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>abstraction</a>.</li><li><strong>Minimal scheduling overhead</strong>. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.</li><li><strong>Highly efficient memory usage</strong>: All the tasks share a single call stack and there’s no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.</li><li><strong>All Cortex-M devices are fully supported</strong>.</li><li>This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven’t yet developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)</li></ul><p>While all these features and capabilities seem great, so what gives?</p><p>Well, for starters there’s no <code>main</code> function. 🙀</p><p>Here’s what a basic blinky app looks like using some of the new BSP (Board support packages) I mentioned earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</span>

        }
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>init</code> function is where you would normally put anything you’d normally put in an Arduino <code>setup</code> function. We’re setting up pins and peripherals. If you want to use them later on though, you’ll need to create an entry in <code>Resources</code>. This is also where you store any type of static mutable data structures that you need elsewhere in your firmware.</p><p>The <code>idle</code> function is similar to the <code>loop</code> function in Arduino. It’s important though that if you want a loop, you have to implement it. Here’s the warning in the <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html?highlight=loop#idle" target="_blank"><code>rtic</code> documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unlike init, idle will run with interrupts enabled and it’s not allowed to return so it must run forever.</p></blockquote><p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use an <code>idle</code> function though. If you don’t, your microcontroller will go to sleep. This is ideal for battery powered applications that need to sleep as much as possible.</p><p>In <code>rtic</code> every work function gets a <code>Context</code> variable. It allow you to access resources that are pertinent to that function’s purpose. Access is only granted though when you add a resource like below:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[idle(resources=[led_pass, delay]</span>)]
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>resources</code> was not set like above, I would not be able to use <code>led_pass</code> or <code>delay</code> within the function!</p><p>While this is a simple example, when you start using static resources like fixed size vectors you’ll be happy you chose to use <code>rtic</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/japaric/heapless" target="_blank"><code>heapless</code></a> crate has been extremely useful for setting size contrained elements that you’d normally be able to use with Rust’s <code>std</code> lib.</p><p>While <code>heapless</code> implements a few very handy types, the <code>Vec</code> and <code>spsc</code> imlementation have been <em>extremely</em> useful. If you’re looking for <code>std</code> conventions for embedded, no need to look further. Get started with <code>heapless</code> with their great documentation <a href="https://japaric.github.io/heapless/heapless/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 id="the-confusion-ensues">The confusion ensues</h3><p>One thing that may be confusing …</p></div></div>

  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="9dfc6912-3fe0-bf1a-3d6f-bb95ffba0a17"><p>The <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> are Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles designed for writing Clean Code. According to Robert C. Martin’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>” book, in order to keep a good software development pace, it’s important for a team to write Clean Code. By implementing ugly code, you can surely come up with decent results quickly, but in the long run, your project will end up crashing into a wall.<br></p><p>It is known that a software dies when it’s no longer possible to understand it or add new features to it in a reasonable period of time. Keeping things clean is crucial to successfully convey any software project. This line of thought applies especially to machine learning projects that involve taking solutions from research or academic projects and implementing them into a production environment.<br></p><p>Research code is known to be dirty. Why? Because it’s often directed towards one goal only: making proofs of concept (POC) as quickly as possible. In this case, there’s not much incentive to keep one’s code clean. But if you plan on building a maintainable and scalable product, dirty code will not last long.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>“SOLID”, you said? </strong><br></p><p>Here are the SOLID principles, in addition to the Tell Don't Ask (TDA) principle which is also relevant.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).<br>	Every class has one responsibility only.</li><li>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP). <br>	Classes are closed to modification and open to extension.</li><li>L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). <br>	Subtypes should be properly interchangeable with the base type.</li><li>I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). <br>	Separate interfaces across your objects rather than implementing only a big one.</li><li>D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). <br>	Depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.</li><li>Also: Tell Don’t Ask (TDA). <br> Don’t manage an object from the outside, rather tell it what to do.<br></li></ul><p>Let’s dive deeper into these concepts.</p><p><strong>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that every class has one responsibility only. For instance, if you’re tempted to name a class SomethingAndSomethingElse, it’s a sign that the class should probably be split into two.<br></p><p>Separating classes to give them one responsibility each will ease things when time comes to change code. Not only it will be easier to implement changes, but the different parts will be more reusable and malleable. It‘s an easy and safe way to code successive prototypes. It also makes the test protocol smoother by allowing to test one thing at a time. So when an error pops up, you can easily pinpoint the problem.<br></p><p>In addition, when several developers work together on the same project, respecting the SRP reduces the chances of two developers stepping on each other’s toes (modifying the same object at the same time). Imagine that the SomethingAndSomethingElse class has the responsibility of doing two different tasks (the task Something and the task SomethingElse) and that these tasks need to be refactored. If two developers take care of one task each, they will find themselves modifying the same object at the same time, which will probably cause a conflict in the code when the time comes to merge the two solutions in the project. On the other hand, if SomethingAndSomethingElse is split into two classes in respect of SRP, the two developers can work on two different objects thus avoiding the conflict. Handling conflict in code is generally time consuming and very prone to bugs. This phenomenon should be avoided as much as possible.<br></p><p>Let’s apply SRP to a machine learning context. Suppose we have a class named MyNormalizerAndMyModel. This design pattern is most likely to be too rigid, too specific and not malleable. Here’s what could (and should) be done. First, a class named MyModel would be made. If you think it’s part of the job of MyModel to normalize data, a method named ‘’normalize’’ would be implemented inside of it. If not, another class named MyNormalizer (which would inherit from the same superclass as MyModel) should be implemented. This class would implement the method ‘’normalize’’. Another class named MyPredictor could then be implemented which would ingest data and one or more models to make predictions. MyPredictor would therefore represent what is called a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/python-what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline">Pipeline</a>. It could encapsulate objects of type MyNormalizer, MyModel, etc. Other models could be implemented and used in the pipeline by simply swapping MyModel with another class representing another model. This way, it is easy to reuse some objects in different contexts without having to duplicate code or modify an existing model (also see Open-Closed Principle - OCP).<br></p><p>Using a framework like <a href="https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle">Neuraxle</a> (which is open source) greatly facilitates the construction of pipelines.<br></p><p>This principle also applies to data loading. It’s better to give the responsibility of loading data to a class apart from our machine learning algorithm. You would want to pass already loaded and crunched data to a pipeline made of model instances, so that the source of the data and the way to load it (there can be a lot) would not matter for the pipeline. This is also closely related to the Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP.<br></p><p>Another example of properly respecting the SRP in Machine Learning pipelines is to let each step of a pipeline define its own way to initialize itself, to save itself, and to delete itself. This is especially important when implementing deep learning for instance. In that case, some of the pipeline steps might use GPUs as others might use CPUs (<a href="https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/scikit-learn_problems_solutions.html#problem-initializing-the-pipeline-and-deallocating-resources">Such resource management is handled by Neuraxle’s pipelines</a>). It’s therefore important for each step to be able to manage itself. Managing the specifics of each step of a pipeline from outside the pipeline would break not only the SRP but also the Tell Don’t Ask (TDA) principle.<br></p><div><p>Now, suppose that you’re trying to find the best hyperparameters for the different models of a pipeline (this process is called <a href="https://www.neuraxio.com/en/blog/automated-machine-learning-automl/2020/02/22/your-data-scientisti-is-a-mom-(seriously).html">Automated Machine Learning - AutoML</a>). In such a case, it is crucial for each object inside a pipeline to be able to manage its own loading, saving, initialization and deletion in order to effectively allocate and deallocate resources. It would be a nightmare to manage that process outside the model or worst, outside the pipeline. A major default of scikit-learn is its inability to manage this process. It’s also important to respect the SRP and OCP when serializing and saving machine learning pipelines containing code that can’t be saved natively by the python interpreter (e.g.: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41567895/will-scikit-learn-utilize-gpu">here</a> is how Neuraxle solves the issue of using GPU resources, making use of proper abstractions that respects SRP and OCP).</p></div><p><strong>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that a class should be closed to modification, and open to extension. Which means that if a new functionality has to be added to a project, you shouldn’t have to go back to existing classes to edit stuff that is already working.<br></p><p>The most obvious example of not respecting this principle is to include long if/else statement chains (switch cases) in a single piece of code. Having too many if/else encapsulated in such a blob is called “poor man’s polymorphism”. Polymorphism is the ability for an object to inherit from others and take other forms in order to provide different functionalities. Rather than coding a lengthy if/else block at a particular point in a pipeline, it’s advised to implement an abstract class that is open to modifications (to polymorphism, in this case). All the different cases supposedly handled by an if/else block can then be incarnated by as many different sub-classes as needed, all inheriting from the previously built abstract class. Such a sub-class can then override certain methods of its parent abstract super-class as you see fit. By doing that, there’s no need to modify the abstract super-class or any of its sub-classes when implementing new functionalities. You would just implement a new sub-class inheriting from the same super-class, and inject it where you see fit (see the section about the DIP for more information about injection).<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate that principle with the example of loading data as a step of a machine learning pipeline. It’s certainly not a good idea to simply implement a function called “load_data” which would have a huge if/else block to cover all the possible cases like fetching data from a local repository, an external repository, an SQL table, a CSV file, an S3 bucket, etc. It would be better to implement an abstract class called DataLoader (or DataRepository). It would then be possible to implement as many concrete subclasses as needed to mimic the different ways of loading data. When the time comes to add a data loading step in a pipeline, the right sub-class (inheriting from DataLoader) suiting the context could be picked, so the pipeline doesn’t go through a useless chain of if/else statements to decide how to load data.<br></p><p>Here is another example to take this concept a step further. In compliance with OCP, it is possible to implement an effective strategy for choosing the right hyperparameters in a machine learning pipeline. Imagine that at a certain stage of a pipeline, you have to choose between the preprocessing method A and the preprocessing method B. The most tempting strategy (without considering OCP) would undoubtedly be to implement a full pipeline using method A and to implement another full pipeline using method B. We would then switch from one pipeline to another directly in the main file using a for loop. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea and it is the approach that most programmers and/or researchers in data science would recommend. The problem is that as new methods and models are to be implemented and tested, the main file must be modified to include a bigger and bigger polymorphism. This approach will therefore most likely generate a poor man's polymorphism directly in the main file. The main file is actually the worst place to implement this kind of polymorphism because it is outside the source project and its code is not …</p></div></div>

		<section itemprop="articlebody">
			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(326.6) ≈ 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> (about one in a million)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete the President.</strong> Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/07/us/capitol-building-trump">after a violent riot at the capital</a>, Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html">erased the President of the United States from social media</a>. He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This article introduces an approach to structure FastAPI applications with multiple services in mind. The proposed structure decomposes the individual services into packages and modules, following principles of abstraction and separation of concerns. The code discussed below can also be studied in its entirety in a dedicated companion GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="fastapi--building-high-performing-python-apis" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI – Building High-performing Python APIs</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI</a> is a fast, highly intuitive and well-documented API framework based on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Starlette</a>. Despite being relatively new, it's gaining <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#tiangolo/fastapi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">strong adoption</a> by the developer community – it is even already being adopted in production by corporates like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">UNIX philosophy</a> of <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"doing one thing, and doing it well"</em>, separating parts of the application according to their task improves code readability and maintainability; ultimately reducing complexity. The main benefits of structuring applications in this way:</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Separation of concerns</strong> – Decomposing the application into modules performing a single job. This allows accepting requests (top down: controller → service → data access) and returning responses (bottom up: data access → service → controller) with a clear separation of what particular functionality should be implemented in which particular module, reducing cognitive load for development.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6c6e6d1a9a2252c24c72049f74382abee765095c/9408a/_nuxt/img/request-response.df4b985.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Request-Response Flow across Application Layers" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Request-Response Flow across Application Layers</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Abstraction</strong> — Components of the application are designed in a reusable way. For instance, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">ServiceResult</code> is implemented as a generic outcome of a service operation (which may be successful and return a response, or unsuccessful and raise an exception) able to be used by all services of the app, keeping code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">DRY</a>.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc6bd09df8db15e783bd11117eba8003350f04cc/465f4/_nuxt/img/directory-structure.0c63d71.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Directory Structure Overview" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Directory Structure Overview</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The granular nature of namespacing allow to distinguish parts of the application, e.g., routes versus business logic belonging to a particular service – grouping similar tasks together, while keeping distinct parts separated. Four principal packages are needed. For each service, one module is added to these four packages. For instance, a service called <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"Foo"</em> requires the following modules (discussed in detail below):</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./routers/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Router instance and routes</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./services/ foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Business logic (including CRUD helpers)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./schemas/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Data "schemas" (e.g., Pydantic models)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./models/   foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Database models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The four principal packages are complemented by two generic packages which contain application-specific (and not service-specific) functionality, such as configuration or utility functions.</p>
<h2 id="controller-layer--routes" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Controller Layer – Routes</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Within <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code>, the application is instantiated and all routers are included. Additionally, middlewares and/or exception handlers are implemented. The example application discussed below is based on a service called <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">Foo</code>, which requires a number of routes. To handle custom exceptions occurring at the service layer, as instances of class <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">AppExceptionCase</code>, a respective exception handler is added to the application.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Up until the publication of this post, if you went to the front page of <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://ziglang.org</a>, you would be greeted with a multi-page explanation about how Zig improves over the systems programming toolchains that today we take for granted.</p>
<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p>As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from <a href="https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/">Tom Hayden</a> about using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic Map Reduce</a> (EMR) and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">mrjob</a> in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the <a href="https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm">millionbase archive</a>, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sleep <span>3</span> | <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world."</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of <strong>each</strong> file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | awk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.</p><p>This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>However, we can make it a bit faster still by using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a>, which is often a drop-in replacement for <code>gawk</code> and can offer better performance.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | mawk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">My Rules for Writing Well</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>I’ve learned the hard way that writing is… hard. But anyone can become a great writer by following a few rules.</p>

<p>This post is a collection of guidelines I’ve adopted while writing four technical books, publishing countless blogs, and enduring the wrath of frontpage Hacker News commentary. Many of these rules were imparted by the great mentors I’ve had over the years, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/bphogan">Brian Hogan</a> (Pragmatic Bookshelf editor) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmountjoy">Jon Mountjoy</a> (creator of Heroku’s DevCenter).</p>

<h4 id="be-concise">Be concise</h4>
<p>Make every word count.</p>

<h4 id="write-with-the-door-closed-rewrite-with-the-door-open">Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open</h4>
<p>Writing requires concentration, but editing requires feedback. When it’s time to write, close the door, turn off alerts, and remove distractions. When your first draft is complete, share it with people–friends, colleagues, reviewers–and listen to what they say.</p>

<h4 id="use-the-right-word">Use the right word</h4>
<p>Richard Feynman once told a story about a group of physicists explaining “acoustic reverberations” to a confused non-scientist. Feynman interjected, saying “it’s an echo”.</p>

<p>Precise word choice is important, but longer isn’t always better. Unusual vocabulary words and technical jargon distract readers from your point. In general:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t “utilize” something when you can “use” it.</li>
  <li>Don’t “procure” something when you can “buy” it</li>
  <li>Don’t “ascertain” something when you can “learn” it</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="show-it-dont-say-it">Show it, don’t say it</h4>
<p>Avoid the word “easy” in your writing. If something is easy it will go without saying. More importantly, if readers find something difficult, you may alienate them by calling it easy. Avoid “simple” or “straightforward”, too.</p>

<h4 id="cut-and-paste">Cut and paste</h4>
<p>When you write, you’re telling a story. When you rewrite, you’re removing all the parts that are not the story. Be ruthless as you edit. Cut and move sections like Victor Frankenstein piecing together his creature.</p>

<h4 id="bring-your-reader-with-you">Bring your reader with you</h4>
<p>Some pronouns will engage your readers, while others distance you from them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t say “I find it important to”, when you mean “You should”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “It is widely believed”, when you mean “I think”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “I’ll show you how”, when you mean “We’ll see how”</li>
</ul>

<p>I use you/your in this post because I want <em>you</em> to adopt these rules. But if I were writing a tutorial and guiding you on a journey, I might use we/us/ours to indicate that I’m in it with you. It’s sometimes acceptable to switch between we/us/our and you/your in a single piece of writing, but in general you want to pick a voice and stick with those pronouns.</p>

<h4 id="throw-the-first-one-away">Throw the first one away</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man Month</a>, Fred Brooks warns software developers that their first version of code will have bugs, run slowly, and lack features. You’ll likely need to rewrite it. The same caution applies when writing prose. Plan to throw your first draft away. You’re going to make mistakes; might as well make them quickly and get on to the second draft.</p>

<h4 id="write-write-write">Write, write, write</h4>
<p>Writing is a muscle. Practice your writing, share it with people, and learn from their feedback. Like going to the gym, it’s not easy. You’ll need to create a writing schedule and set goals. Will you publish one blog post a month? Will you write a post this year that gets one-thousand views? Aim high.</p>

<h4 id="know-your-craft">Know your craft</h4>
<p>Writing is a craft, which means there’s always more to learn. There are many more rules I could have included in this post, like “prefer the active voice”, “avoid noun stacks”, “use action verbs”, and “use puncuation effectively”. But then I’d be writing a fifth book. Instead, I encourage you to read some of the wonderful resources I’ve used over the years:</p>

<p>Writing isn’t a science. There’s a time to break the rules, but do so cautiously.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Four years ago, when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">Ant Group’s premier money market fund</a> was racing to a peak of more than $260bn worth of assets under management, many of China’s state-owned banks and their regulators started to get agitated. In a series of calls and meetings with Jack Ma, Ant’s founder, bank executives and regulatory officials demanded that its Yu’E Bao fund be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f9deba0-51e1-3c8e-9f1c-1d71a384028d" data-trackable="link">reined in</a>.</p>
<p>“Yu’E Bao was pulling a lot of money from the banks,” says one person familiar with the discussions. “The banks were worried about the impact on liquidity and wanted Ant to take measures to minimise the impact. The conversations were pretty tense.”</p>
<p>In the end, Mr Ma had to back down and Yu’E Bao imposed caps on how much people could deposit. Between March and December of 2018, its funds under management <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35bbbef6-20a8-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65" data-trackable="link">fell by a third</a> to $168bn and stood at $183bn last September.</p>
<p>The showdown would prove to be a prelude to the much bigger confrontation that now pits the Chinese Communist party and President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b" data-trackable="link">against not just Ant but also Alibaba</a>, the ecommerce group founded by Mr Ma. </p>
<p>The stand-off, which has sparked <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b3a94f55-5e44-417f-a869-a542d0527fe7" data-trackable="link">rampant speculation about Mr Ma’s whereabouts</a>, could become a defining moment for the future of private business in Mr Xi’s China.</p>
<p>On December 24, China’s market regulator announced it was launching an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdcc073f-3b70-4411-92d7-ee36973a8b7a" data-trackable="link">antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> and sent investigators to its headquarters in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Mr Ma’s hometown. The announcement came just two weeks after the party’s politburo said it would target monopoly businesses to prevent the “disorderly expansion of capital”.</p>

<p>The move on Alibaba also came two months after financial regulators dramatically cancelled Ant’s planned $37bn initial public offering, which would have been the world’s largest.</p>
<p>Taken together, the measures amount to an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84d57797-4211-4658-ac54-ebdcb5146151" data-trackable="link">unprecedented squeeze on a business empire</a> whose ubiquitous services are central to the functioning of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c636a22e-dd3f-403e-a72d-c3ffb375459c" data-trackable="link">China’s pioneering online economy</a>. Ant says Alipay, its payment app, is regularly used by 700m people — half of China’s total population — and 80m merchants, processing payments worth Rmb118tn ($18.2tn) in the group’s last financial year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alibaba’s shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent since the regulatory showdown began in late October, putting a big dent in the net worth of Mr Ma, who has not been seen in public since then. Over the same period his fortune has declined from $62bn to $49bn, according to Bloomberg data. The Hurun China Rich List estimated that Mr Ma had been the country’s richest man as recently as October 20 but would now rank fourth, his top slot taken by a bottled water tycoon, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e09bd3a4-29e3-47ac-bad2-19d29b47d777" data-trackable="link">Zhong Shanshan</a>.</p>
<p>The results of the showdown will say a lot about the sort of economy that China is developing. If Ant and Alibaba are crippled by regulators — or its founder is personally targeted by investigators — it will go down as a landmark moment in the party’s fickle relationship with China’s private sector even though Mr Ma is, ironically, a party member himself.</p>
<p>Since Deng Xiaoping launched the “reform and opening” era 40 years ago, the party has become ever more dependent on private sector companies for economic growth, job creation and tax revenues. But the party’s fixation with control, especially since Mr Xi came to power almost a decade ago, also triggers periodic crackdowns on the sector and prominent entrepreneurs. </p>
<div>
<figure><picture><source media="screen and (max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-mobile.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/b85f190e-e69f-4767-b253-b9355fa0f700" data-original-image-width="301" data-original-image-height="401"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-standard.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/3a63d780-65bf-4baf-896f-210d3475c482" data-image-type="graphic" data-original-image-width="700" data-original-image-height="500" alt="Ant Group’s revenue breakdown"></picture></figure>
</div>
<p>Yet there is another potential outcome that would indicate a less fraught relationship between the party-state and business. The investigations into Ant and Alibaba could lead to the sort of settlements that are not dissimilar to those pursued in the US and EU against large finance and technology groups. That would leave Mr Ma’s two flagship companies humbled but still formidable and highly profitable national champions. Even then, a strong political message would have been sent.</p>
<p>“Chinese internet magnates can still enjoy thriving businesses and enormous fortunes if they are able to convince the top leadership of their loyalty,” says Chen Long at Plenum, a Beijing-based consultancy. “The top leadership wants to ensure that neither Ma nor anyone else ever crosses the red line of trying to exert personal influence over government policies again — at least not publicly. The government will support them on the condition that they serve the national interest first.” </p>
<h2>Fintech revolution</h2>
<p>Mr Ma has not appeared in public since October 24, when he gave a high-profile speech critical of the same state-owned banks he clashed with over Yu’E Bao’s rapid growth, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/843b3f60-292b-431f-a94c-93c78bc72bae" data-trackable="link">as well as regulators</a> who he said often sacrifice innovation on the altar of stability. According to people involved in the listing, the speech angered Mr Xi, who made the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87883923-e321-4632-a1cb-dc2663a00456" data-trackable="link">final decision</a> to halt the Ant IPO. </p>



<p>“To innovate without taking risks is to strangle innovation,” Mr Ma said. “There is no such thing as riskless innovation in the world. Very often, an attempt to minimise risk to zero is the biggest risk itself.”</p>
<p>He was speaking at the same forum where Wang Qishan, Mr Xi’s powerful vice-president and former <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82964ba-6d42-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" data-trackable="link">anti-corruption tsar</a>, had earlier emphasised the paramount importance of financial system stability. “Efforts should be made to prevent and lower financial risks . . . security always ranks first,” Mr Wang said. “While new financial technologies have improved efficiency and brought convenience, financial risks have been heightened.”</p>
<p>In an unprecedented public rebuke of Ant two months later, on December 26 China’s central bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96b0bc5f-c02c-41de-be90-fd4a3f56fd2f" data-trackable="link">criticised Ant for being too cavalier about financial risk</a> and taking advantage of regulatory loopholes. But as frustrated as regulators are with Ant, they cannot ignore the beneficial effects of the financial revolution it has led in China.</p>
<p>“Ant Group,” People’s Bank of China vice-governor Pan Gongsheng admitted in his otherwise critical comments, “has played an innovative role in developing financial technology and improving the efficiency and inclusiveness of financial services”. The central bank, he added in a nod to jittery entrepreneurs, was also “unshakeable” in its commitment to “protect property rights and promote entrepreneurship”.</p>

<p>Mr Ma has long enjoyed support from officials in a range of State Council ministries, as well as the lead financial regulators, who appreciate the contributions of Ant, Alibaba and their rivals, all of whom have transformed China’s economy and made its online services sector a global leader. When his status as a party member was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b6e5f9a-f233-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f" data-trackable="link">first confirmed</a> only two years ago, it was in the context of an award he was receiving from the party’s Central Committee for “making China a leading player in the international ecommerce industry, internet finance and cloud computing”.</p>
<p>Alibaba and Ant’s ecommerce and online payment services were even more critical at the height of China’s successful battle to contain coronavirus, providing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed316d4c-141c-487f-afb4-cd4c92e823fd" data-trackable="link">essential services</a> to the hundreds of millions of people caught in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" data-trackable="link">draconian lockdowns</a>.</p>
<p>“There are different lines of thought within the regulators,” Mr Chen says. “Until Jack Ma’s speech the pro-growth people had the upper hand. But Xi thought the speech was too much and a second [risk-averse] group took the lead. If his speech hadn’t happened, everything would have been fine.” </p>
<p>Disappearing acts are unusual for Mr Ma, who also missed the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" data-trackable="link">November finale</a> of his African reality TV show — <em>Africa’s Business Heroes</em>. He routinely gives <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/308e46a8-6189-11e3-916e-00144feabdc0" data-trackable="link">flamboyant musical performances</a> at Alibaba events and hobnobs with heads of state and government leaders.</p>



<p>As China’s most successful private entrepreneur, Mr Ma enjoys unique status in China — and overseas. His fluent English has made him a huge celebrity on the international conference circuit, with a star quality unmatched by any of his private or state-sector peers. </p>
<p>When Mr Xi hosted the G20 leaders summit in Hangzhou in 2016, some of his guests also visited Mr Ma — something that irked the Chinese president, according to one diplomat involved and other people familiar with the matter. Mr Ma’s VIP callers included Indonesian president Joko Widodo, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and the then Italian premier, Matteo Renzi. Foreign leaders were offered limited time slots and the Chinese foreign ministry was mostly cut out of the process.</p>
<p>Over the past week rumours about Mr Ma’s whereabouts have abounded on China’s carefully monitored social media channels, while domestic media outlets have received <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/62fe82c5-b058-4dd0-bb15-e9428593f078" data-trackable="link">strict instructions</a> from censors about the stories they can and cannot run on Ant and Alibaba’s regulatory troubles. </p>
<p>Many of Mr Ma’s friends and colleagues strongly dispute suggestions that he is personally in any sort of legal jeopardy, let alone on the run. “He is in China and not travelling because of Covid, not anything else. He’s lying low,” says one friend of Mr Ma.</p>

<p>Another friend who communicates with Mr Ma regularly adds: “Everyone is asking me if he’s in danger, but he’s doing fine. He responds [to messages and calls] quickly and seems like he’s in good spirits. Discussions with regulators are still very much in process so he just has to stay quiet until they are resolved.”</p>
<h2>Leadership missteps</h2>
<p>Friends add that while Mr Ma may now regret the consequences of his October 24 speech, he meant what he said and still believes passionately in what he sees as Ant’s mission to transform the provision of financial services in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Yu’E Bao, which translates as “account balance treasure”, was started in 2013 and allowed anyone in China, from restaurant staff to the urban yuppies they serve, to deposit as little as Rmb1 ($0.15) in a money-market fund and earn more interest than they could in a Chinese savings deposit account. Just four years later it became the world’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">largest money market fund</a>, surpassing JPMorgan’s US government money market fund. </p>

<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structured Programming (Programming in C)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to <a href="http://laconicml.com/machine-learning-weka/">programming</a>. It will help you write your first code, run your first application, and see what programming is about. You will start with printing messages on the screen, simple arithmetic operations, if-else statements, loops, data structures (arrays, matrices), memory addresses, pointers, reading and writing files, etc. You will build simple applications that will allow you to understand the material even better. The best two videos that we recommend for this course are:</p>

<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to declarative statements, sets, and operations with sets, laws, logic, quantifiers, functions, proofs, sequences, and summation. For this course, and it’s a second part which we’ve put in Year 2, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 YouTube videos, but we are going to split it, 34 videos for part 1 (1-34) and 26 videos for the part 2 (35-60).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 1-34)</a></li>

</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOjov-2OZ0E" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>

<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Computer System Architecture</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, you are going to be introduced to set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache and virtual memory organizations, protection and sharing, I/O and interrupts, in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, VLIW machines, vector supercomputers, multithreaded architectures, symmetric multiprocessors, and parallel computers. For this course, we will recommend you the following playlist coming from <a href="http://laconicml.com/computer-science-engineer-mit-university/">MIT</a>. The list has 39 videos, that are quite long</p>
<ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Web Design (HTML + CSS)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is your introduction to what one stage of web development (the front-end) looks like. You are going to get familiar with HTML, which is the markup language that makes the elements we see on a webpage, and with CSS, which is a stylesheet that gives life to those elements. Here we recommend two videos, one for HTML and one for CSS.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Man, 2021 escalated quickly! With the increased concerns and distrust of public platforms owned by big companies, “something’s gotta give”. That “something” will probably be hallmark Web 3.0 features which have been in the works for a while, as well as some Web 2.0 applications that lost popularity because people didn’t want to (or in some cases could not afford to) pay money, at least until now. But what is “Web 3.0”? Since it is difficult to define the entirety of Web 3.0 before it becomes mainstream, here are some elements I’m expecting to come from it.</p>



<p>The first thing to expect is an explosion of self-hosted solutions for the <a href="https://joshuaaust.in/blog/2020/08/11/open-web/">Open Web</a>, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, and many others. While that explosion may cool off as quickly as that explosion became hot, it is the first knee-jerk reaction to expect from the distrustful, the censored, as well as for those who wish for a quieter, more thoughtful experience. The hosting has become cheaper as of late – one can self-host a fairly secure WordPress site for as little as $5 a month if they are technically minded, or have someone take care of the technical side for them for as little as $12-15 a month if they are not so technically minded.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>the underlying technology is resistant to even government-level censorship</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The next “big thing” I expect to happen is for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> (or at least its underlying concept of decentralized applications) to start becoming more mainstream, as the underlying technology is resistant to even government-level censorship, though currently at the cost of comparatively slow page-loading times.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0, and will give companies like Facebook a run for their money. This is why Twitter is already researching how it could potentially morph into a decentralized system in the years ahead.</p>



<p>This will enable both good and bad.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the bad – to be certain, bad people ranging from human traffickers to fake news vendors and everybody in between will harness this to their advantage. This won’t render catching the criminals impossible, it’ll just mean they can’t be easily censored and catching them via the Internet will require a change in strategy.</p>



<p>However, this also opens up the potential for many good things! Soon we may be able to transmit money digitally without the need (or the trust) of a third party vendor, and with increased security measures. As of right now, you can donate the Ether cryptocurrency directly to my decentralized domain name, codextypes.eth, without the need for entrusting PayPal or Venmo’s data warehouses to protect your sensitive financial data. For a transaction fee, I can convert this into fiat currencies where it is legal. In the US, for example, it is currently allowed provided I report any capital gains.</p>



<p>This will also enable religious freedom in new and exciting ways, such as Christian communities being able to archive and share digital copies of the Scriptures in their local languages, both text and audio, without censorship from persecuting governments.</p>



<p>This also has the potential to enable people who previously couldn’t afford a WordPress subscription or hosting plan to have a place where they can share their thoughts and beliefs with full control over their data.</p>



<p>Every major iteration of the Internet won’t help or solve the human condition, but it will attempt to improve upon the technical pain points that came with the previous iteration of the Internet, and that’s something to be excited about!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The promise of free software is a near-future utopia, built on democratized technology. This future is just and it is beautiful, full of opportunity and fulfillment for everyone everywhere. We can create the things we dream about when we let our minds wander into the places they want to. We can be with the people we want and need to be, when we want and need to.</p>
<p>This is currently possible with the technology we have today, but it’s availability is limited by the reality of the world we live in – the injustice, the inequity, the inequality. Technology runs the world, but it does not serve the interests of most of us. In order to create a better world, our technology must be transparent, accountable, trustworthy. It must be just. It must be free.</p>
<p>The job of the free software movement is to demonstrate that this world is possible by living its values now: justice, equity, equality. We build them into our technology, and we build technology that make it possible for these values to exist in the world.</p>
<p>At the Free Software Foundation, we liked to say that we used all free software because it was important to show that we could. <i>You can do anything with free software</i>, so we did everything with it. We demonstrated the importance of unions for tech workers and non-profit workers by having one. We organized collectively and protected our rights for the sake of ourselves and one another. We had non-negotiable salaries, based on responsibility level and position. That didn’t mean we worked in an office free from the systemic problems that plague workplaces everywhere, but we were able to think about them differently.</p>
<p>Things were this way because of Richard Stallman – but I view his influence on these things as negative rather than positive. He was a cause that forced these outcomes, rather than being supportive of the desires and needs of others. Rather than indulge in gossip or stories, I would like to jump to the idea that he was supposed to have been deplatformed in October 2019. In resigning from his position as president of the FSF, he certainly lost some of his ability to reach audiences. However, Richard still gives talks. The FSF continues to use his image and rhetoric in their own messaging and materials. They gave him time to speak at their annual conference in 2020. He maintains leadership in the GNU project and otherwise within the FSF sphere. The people who empowered him for so many years are still in charge.</p>
<p>Richard, and the continued respect and space he is given, is not the only problem. It represents a bigger problem. Sexism and racism (among others) run rampant in the community. This happens because of bad actors and, more significantly, by the complacency of organizations, projects, and individuals afraid of losing contributors, respect, or funding. In a sector that has so much money and so many resources, women are still being paid less than men; we deny people opportunities to learn and grow in the name of immediate results; people who aren’t men, who aren’t white, are abused and harassed; people are mentally and emotionally taken advantage of, and we are coerced into burn out and giving up our lives for these companies and projects and we are paid for tolerating all of this by being told we’re doing a good job or making a difference.</p>
<p>But we’re not making a difference. We’re perpetuating the worst of the status quo that we should be fighting against. We must not continue. We cannot. We need to live our ideals as they are, and take the natural next steps in their evolution. We cannot have a world of just technology when we live in a world of exclusion; we cannot have free software if we continue to allow, tolerate, and laud the worst of us. I’ve been in and around free software for seventeen years. Nearly every part of it I’ve participated in has members and leadership that benefit from allowing and encouraging the continuation of maleficence and systemic oppression.</p>
<p>We must purge ourselves of these things – of sexism, racism, injustice, and the people who continue and enable it. There is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic – if it hurt a trans person then it is transphobic and it is unacceptable. Racism is a global problem and we must be anti-racist or we are complicit. Sexism is present and all men benefit from it, even if they don’t want to. These are free software issues. These are things that plague software, and these are things software reinforces within our societies.</p>
<p>If a technology is exclusionary, it does not work. If a community is exclusionary, it must be fixed or thrown away. There is no middle ground here. There is no compromise. Without doing this, without taking the hard, painful steps to actually live the promise of user freedom and everything it requires and entails, our work is pointless and free software will fail.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s too late for there to be a radical change – the radical change – that allows us to create the utopia we want to see in the world. We must do that by acknowledging that just technology leads to a just society, and that a just society allows us to make just technology. We must do that by living within the principles that guide this future now.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen if things don’t change soon. I recently saw someone comment that change doesn’t happens unless one person is willing to sacrifice everything to make that change, to lead and inspire others to play small parts. This is unreasonable to ask of or expect from someone. I’ve been burning myself out to meet other people’s expectations for seventeen years, and I can’t keep doing it. Of course I am not alone, and I am not the only one working on and occupied by these problems. More people must step up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of us, the work free software needs to do, and the future I dream about.</p>

	<p>It will span some 170 kilometers, have no cars—and yet promises a 20-minute commute to work. That’s the vision for an ambitious linear city to be built in Saudi Arabia called, fittingly, The Line.</p>
<p>Announced by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, the development aims to be entirely powered by renewable energy, made more efficient through the use of AI and big data, and producing zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The belt of “hyper-connected future communities” will stretch from the Red Sea coast inland through the 26,500-square-kilometer NEOM giga project in northwest Saudi Arabia, according to a press statement.</p>
<p>Plans show a top “pedestrian layer” with no cars or roads, with an infrastructure “service layer” beneath, and a “spine layer” below that with AI-powered transport and freight operations.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Welcome to the new future.<br>

<p>The aim is to have schools, clinics, and leisure facilities within a five-minute walk of people’s homes, with no commute longer than 20 minutes. With construction set to start this quarter, the city is expected to be home to a million people.</p>
<p>“After the Industrial Revolution, cities prioritized machines, cars and factories over people. In cities that are viewed as the world’s most advanced, people spend years of their lives commuting,” said Crown Prince Mohammed.</p>
<p>“Why should seven million people die every year because of pollution? Why should we lose one million people every year due to traffic accidents? And why should we accept wasting years of our lives commuting?</p>
<p>“We need to transform the concept of a conventional city into that of a futuristic one.”</p>
<p>Big data and AI will be harnessed to boost the efficiency of services at the new development, according to NEOM. “An estimated 90 percent of available data will be harnessed to enhance infrastructure capabilities far beyond the 1 percent typically utilized in existing smart cities,” it said. “Communities empowered by AI will learn and predict ways to make life easier to save time for residents and businesses.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Background: Why I had to pivot</h3><p>Almost 3 years ago I incorporated Kinesis Inc, the corporate entity behind <a href="https://xkit.co/">Xkit</a>. But at the time I was building a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange. After going through Y Combinator and raising $3.5M from some great investors and building a product I was really proud of, I made the hard decision to <a href="https://sparkswap.com/">shut it down</a> nearly a year ago. We hadn't found an audience that would provide venture scale growth, so it was back to the drawing board.</p><p>I started working on an idea in FinTech, trying to help a friend's company solve a problem with SMB customers not paying on time (or at all) for their services. As I talked to prospective customers about the problem, one thing became abundantly clear: in the time that I had spent away from the SaaS world toiling in the Bitcoin mines, expectations around how SaaS tools work together had radically shifted. It was no longer a "bonus" that you worked with some of their other tools, it was an outright necessity. For the product I was exploring I would be building integrations with Quickbooks, Xero, Stripe, and a few others.</p><p>I asked around if anyone had any good tools to accelerate this process, but the responses I got back were pretty disappointing. Nearly every tool was focused on <em>consumers</em> of SaaS software plugging together the services that they used. Not nearly as much was out there for <em>producers</em> of SaaS software trying to build native integrations to the other tools their customers use. Not only that, but the ones that did exist tried to pretend that we live in a world where powerful integrations are easy to design and maintain with a GUI. While I'm a fan of no-code and low-code solutions, the fact remains that for some tasks, leaning on a software development lifecycle is still the most effective and efficient way to build it.</p><p>In the meantime, the US blew up with COVID, throwing the financial markets (which my new FinTech project was heavily dependent on) into turmoil. So like any good (read: desperate) startup founder, I scrapped the FinTech project and started building the tool that I wish had existed to help me build integrations to my prospective customers' other SaaS apps. And despite never having touched the language, I decided to build it in Elixir.</p><h3>Choosing Elixir</h3><p>I've spent most of my career as a software engineer writing in Javascript and Ruby. I've long been intrigued by the concepts behind functional programming (years ago I wrote a small toy to try to achieve immutability on the web, like a centralized IPFS), and a friend introduced me to Elixir, which incorporated some Ruby syntax, making it a bit friendlier to get started with.</p><p>The concepts behind Erlang/OTP/Elixir make it a great fit for a tool like the one I was building. I knew it would be heavily dependent on outside services, meaning it had to be robust to crashes and other unforeseen events. And I knew high concurrency and low latency would be important features as a piece of developer infrastructure. I also wanted to test out <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html">Paul Graham's theory of hiring programmers</a>: choose a good language and great programmers will always want to work for you. And finally, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that just wanted to try something new. I had spent the past two years working an idea I had to shut down, my "big pivot" was a non-starter, I had laid off nearly the entire team, and for product development it was just me in my bedroom. So I liked the idea of learning something new while working on my second pivot in 3 months.</p><h3>Learning Elixir</h3><p>I read through <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Elixir's fabulous language guide</a>. I mean I really read it, cover to cover, and did pretty much all the examples as they came up. Then I read through a handful of pages in the Phoenix (the most popular web framework for Elixir) guides before I said "f*** it" and started building what became Xkit. My first commit was on May 14, 2020. Commit message: "Initial install with platforms".</p><p>The first week was rough. I wasn't used to moving this slowly, but not only was a learning a new language with features pretty unfamiliar to me like pattern-matching, I was learning a new paradigm. Javascript is whatever you want it to be, which means I had some exposure to FP incidentally, but almost everything I've spent significant time on has had a pretty object-oriented flavor to it, even dating back to when I first got started with PHP. Not to mention the entire ethos of OTP to "fail fast and noisily" which ran counter to so many experiences which focused on avoiding failure at all costs (yes, I've seen some pretty large try/catch blocks in my day). I got pretty discouraged at the pace I was moving, and somewhere about 10 days in I was really regretting not just using Node/Express, a stack I was so familiar with it felt like I could write the app in my sleep.</p><p>But I kept at it (probably more out of pride than anything else) and a few days later I felt things start to shift. I still wasn't moving fast, but I could tell I was improving. Things that only a few days ago had felt foreign and impossible to grasp started to make sense. From that point on I started accelerating, and on June 1st, I sent one of my investors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dJi3sAsHM0">this video</a> showing the first version of what became Xkit.</p><figure id="w-node-f920538a9a16-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dJi3sAsHM0"></iframe></p></figure><h3>Shortcomings of Elixir and Phoenix</h3><p>I started off trying to use a pure Phoenix stack including their new real-time front-end, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">LiveView</a>. I'll be honest, although I really like Elixir and Phoenix, using Phoenix for the front-end brought me back a bit to my Rails days, and not in a good way. Building a modern web application with those tools felt like I'd be working against the tide. I also am pretty partial to <a href="https://evergreen.segment.com/">Evergreen</a>, the React UI kit by Segment, and I was bearing down on the 6 week timeline I'd set for myself to launch this product. So I ripped out the Phoenix front-end and converted it to be a back-end only application and built a new front-end in React and Evergreen. I did end up using Phoenix's websocket implementation which was a big help integrating the two, although some pieces are not very well documented.</p><p>When I finally getting close to launching, I ran up against the greatest weakness of my choice to use Elixir: deployment. While the world has moved towards a serverless paradigm, Elixir/Erlang/OTP thrive by handling a lot of the same things that "serverless" promises. That means that to really take advantage of all it has to offer, you're better off deploying it on as close to bare metal as you can. That, in addition to some of the architecture choices I made with Xkit (specifically to provision a custom subdomain for every user), made deployment quite a challenge. Failing to find any good documentation about how to deploy a Phoenix application on AWS, I ended up <a href="https://xkit.co/post/deploying-phoenix-for-elixir-on-aws-ec2">writing a blog post about our process</a>.</p><p>You might think it's overkill for a one-person development team to have a one-command deploy process, but I assure you, based on my past experience, it's well worth the effort. You don't want critical DevOps knowledge in one person's head, or worse, on some inscrutable AWS GUI. I want it all in code. Even today, you can take the entire Xkit stack, move it to a new AWS account and have it up and running with a single command in around 30 minutes.</p><h3>Launching Xkit</h3><p>The delays I hit caused me to miss my six week launch goal by two weeks: I launched to some fellow YC founders on July 12 with ~15 connectors and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MqwQ3Czejs">this video</a>. Two weeks after that I launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/xkit">Product Hunt</a> and shortly after that on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24121290">Hacker News</a> with over 25 connectors. Since then we've worked with some really great early customers who have helped us refine the product, and I've been able to hire a few friends to help grow the business.</p><figure id="w-node-9133d12a636d-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MqwQ3Czejs"></iframe></p></figure><p>We're well over 50 connectors at this point (almost entirely driven by customer requests) and we add so many that we no longer track it as a metric. And while I'm still contributing code, I can safely say that the majority of the coding that I will do for Xkit is now likely behind me. But the process of building Xkit (and learning Elixir in the process) has been incredibly rewarding, and hopefully we're just getting started.</p><p>‍</p><p>PS - In case you're wondering about the answer to PG's theory about language being a good hiring tool - my early results indicate that it is. From a single post on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/">Elixir Forum</a> I met one of the best engineers I've seen, and a few weeks later he recruited one of the best engineers he'd worked with to join the team.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

      <p>Rumors have been swirling around which stores and spaces will be repurposed as COVID vaccination sites, from Whole Foods&nbsp;to London nightclubs. And this morning, we learned that people might be lining up for their vaccines at the Apple Genius Bar. CBS News reported that Apple will make a big announcement tomorrow, January 13. According to CBS, the forthcoming announcement is not product-related and will&nbsp;have a major impact on the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People have been speculating that Apple Stores will be used to administer COVID vaccinations, and, according to our data, they're perfectly positioned for the task.</p>

<p>On the above map, the shaded regions represent areas with&nbsp;large percentages of people with COVID symptoms. The yellow dots are Apple stores. Store locations are largely concentrated where COVID symptoms&nbsp;have been reaching record highs— the northeast, southeast, upper midwest, California. The United States has woefully underperformed its vaccination targets so far. Only about 9 million Americans have received the vaccination thus far, underperforming the CDC's target to have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020. President-elect Joe Biden has announced a drive to have 100 million Americans vaccinated during his first 100 days in office, which will require dozens of new sites to be opened around the country.</p>
<p>If Apple stores do indeed become vaccination centers, that would likely have a positive impact on what has been one of the biggest blockers so far in the distribution chain — getting the vaccine from freezers into peoples' arms.</p>
<p><em>CBS This Morning</em> teased&nbsp;the interview with Tim Cook, which&nbsp;<span>Gayle King</span>&nbsp;conducted at an Apple Store. "What we're going to tell you about tomorrow, it's very exciting news,"&nbsp;King says. "[Cook is] a&nbsp;very strong business leader who deeply cares about this country ... and wants to do good." Watch the full clip below.</p>

      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<p>Replicated Object Notation (RON) is a format for <em>distributed live data</em>. It guarantees continuous <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ronc.sm">bitwise</a> convergence of replicated data structures in a network of arbitrary <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/network.sm">topology</a>. That makes it a good fit for collaborative software, data synchronization on mobile devices, and broadly defined decentralized apps.
RON was specifically designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a> (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types).
For example, this page is a versioned/collaborative <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">CRDT object</a> containing some CommonMark <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@text">wikitext</a>.
RON can express non-CRDT data too.</p>
<p>RON is op-based, so it expresses objects, patches and separate ops with equal ease. It can work in real-time, it can work offline. Still, it tries very hard to look like your regular notation of the day.
Here is a simple <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> object:</p>
<pre><code>    {   "_id":      "0-2dE-Wares",
        "type":     "apples",
        "quantity": 4,
        "color":    "red"           }
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it may look in RON:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-2dE-Wares :struct,
        type        apples,
        quantity    4,
        color       red;
</code></pre>
<p>This does not seem like a big difference.
Looks like RON is yet another notation, like <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> or something, right?
Key differences are three:</p>
<ol>
<li>RON is op-based, so every line here is an op.</li>
<li>Every op has a globally unique ID, like <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>;
we may skip those IDs when they go in incremental sequence.</li>
<li>RON is typed, e.g. this particular object is a <code>struct</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RON ops, objects and versions are all addressable.
Every new op gets a unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamp</a> ID.
That ID also serves as the ID of the version that op created
(in the context of our <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/oplog.sm">subjective order</a> of events).
The op that created the object gives its ID to the object itself,
e.g. <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>.</p>
<p>Now suppose you ate one apple. How do you convey that?
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC6902</a> JSON patch may look like this:</p>
<pre><code> [ { "op":"replace", "path":"/quantity", "value":3 } ]
</code></pre>
<p>With RON, you add a new op that references the object.</p>
<pre><code>    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the new op has an ID <code>4-2dI-Wares</code>.
Also, it references the version of the object it amends: <code>3-2dH-Wares</code>.
That was the id of the last op; the one that set <code>color</code> to <code>red</code>.</p>
<p>If you can point to a particular version of the object, why not
request a patch?</p>
<pre><code>    @patch :3-2dH-Wares? 
    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>RON supports arbitrary data structures.
RON Struct is a simple and cheap one, it does not support nesting or complex values.
Although, values of a <code>struct</code> can be IDs referencing other objects, so that way you
can nest other data structures in it.
Still, RON Trie is the best one to represent arbitrary JSON.
Suppose, I list the contents of my shelf in JSON:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "shelf": {
        "jarA": {
            "content": "candies",
            "count": 20
        },
        "jarB": {
            "content": "vitamins",
            "count": 100
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/trie.sm">RON Trie</a> is like a regular <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">trie</a>, except it consists of
tuples of RON atoms, not strings of chars.
For our shelf JSON, a <code>trie</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>@0-3d-Wares :trie,
    shelf   jarA    content candies,
    ~       ~       count   20,
    ~       jarB    content vitamins,
    ~       ~       count   100;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, RON shows its tabular nature.
Still, you may also see the trie, defined as a set of tuples/paths.</p>
<p>The directory/file structure of this wiki is stored as a trie.
You may see the resulting <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@trie:DW_ROOT">RON trie</a> or the
<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront:DW_ROOT">original RON trie</a> with all the history and metadata.
You may also see it as <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@json:DW_ROOT">JSON</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at
the crown jewel of the system: a type for collaboratively edited text.
Like the one you may find in Google Docs or a similar system. Those need a lot of
rocket science under the hood!
In a real-time collaboratively edited text, every letter is added or removed
by a separate op. That may produce a lot of overheads, so every serialization
of RON (<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/'serial'/ront.sm">RONt</a>, RONv, RONp) optimizes that case in some way.
RONt uses <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spreads.sm">spreads</a>: consecutively numbered single-char ops merge into a string. Here you see six formally-identical ways to render "Hello world!":</p>
<pre><code>@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world!');
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), '!';
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', ('ello world'), 
                            @C-jS-test :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 
                        'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!';
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying CRDT data type is named a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Causal Tree</a>.
All pages of this wiki are stored as causal tries.
See the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">source RON</a> of this page for an extensive example of
a RONt coded versioned text.</p>
<p>The last but not the least, let's consider such a boring but
essential topic as tabular data.
For your average CSV data-dump cases, RON supports a simple
tabular type <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/tab.sm">RON Tab</a>. For a CSV like this:</p>
<pre><code>Jar;Content;Count
jarA;candies;20
jarB;vitamins;100
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>tab</code> object would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   @0-dK2-data :tab  jar    content     count,
                     jarA   candies     20,
                     jarB   vitamins    100;
</code></pre>
<p><code>tab</code> is a cheap and simple type. It can not change the format
of a record; it can only append or remove whole records.</p>
<p>But suppose you need something more like Excel, a lot of action around
your data. Then, you may resort to the most general key-value RON type
named Dict. It maps any RON tuple to another tuple.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-X3n-data :dict,
        jarA   content   ~   candies,
        jarA   count     ~   20,
        jarB   content   ~   vitamins,
        jarB   count     ~   100;
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>dict</code> can store sparse or multidimensional tables,
as it can update, insert or delete columns, rows or separate cells.
Actually, <code>dict</code> can express a broad range of data structures,
including relational tables.</p>
<p>Now, it is probably the right time to introduce the formal rules of RON.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are four types of RON atoms:
<ol>
<li>UUID, a 128-bit <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spec/uuid.sm">RON UUID</a> that can be of one of four <em>versions</em>:
NAME, TAG, LAMPORT, YOLO. The last two are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamps</a>.</li>
<li>INT, a 64-bit signed integer,</li>
<li>STRING, a Unicode string,</li>
<li>FLOAT, an IEEE 754 float.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A RON tuple contains zero or more RON atoms, of any types.
Tuple size is limited to 1GB in the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/%27serial%27/ronc.sm">RONc form</a>.</li>
<li>A RON op is a RON tuple that also has its own globally unique UUID
(of a logical timestamp kind) and references some pre-existing op by
its UUID. This reference attaches the new op to the existing graph
of data. That way, RON builds data structures out of ops.</li>
<li>One or more RON ops form a <em>frame</em>. A frame can be a FACT, a QUERY,
or a CLAIM. In RONt, these are denoted with <code>;</code> <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> terminating signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what RON is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>Confluent uses <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/04/step-by-step-toward-property-based-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">property-based testing</a> to test various aspects of Confluent Server’s <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiered Storage</a> feature. Tiered Storage shifts data from expensive local broker disks to cheaper, scalable object storage, thereby reducing storage costs, rebalancing times, and improving elasticity. However, if Tiered Storage is not implemented correctly, the result can be significant data loss.</p>
<p>Property-based testing is highly effective when used in combination with traditional testing techniques, such as example-based testing, integration testing, and so on. This post describes some of the property-based testing that Confluent performs on the log-orientated storage layer of Confluent Server and how we test the integration of Tiered Storage with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>’s traditional storage layer.</p>
<p>Property-based testing aims to test several key behaviors of the log to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must never be prematurely deleted due to the different forms of retention or other log operations</li>
<li>Data must never be exposed incorrectly to follower brokers or consumers</li>
<li>We should not tier data that may potentially be truncated due to Apache Kafka’s replication protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement a stateful property test for the log layer, we used <a href="https://www.scalacheck.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScalaCheck’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md#stateful-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateful testing functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the relevant terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log</strong>: the log that stores replica data for a partition</li>
<li><strong>System Under Test (SUT):</strong> the real system being modelled, which is a log in this case</li>
<li><strong>Log model:</strong> the modeled state for the system under test (SUT)</li>
<li><strong>Log segment:</strong> a unit of zero or more record batches; consists of a .log file and associated indices</li>
<li><strong>Active segment:</strong> the segment with the highest base offset and to which new appends will be written</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> the process by which users control the size of a topic’s partitions by duration, size, or triggered deletions</li>
<li><strong>Log start offset:</strong> the inclusive lower bound offset for the log</li>
<li><strong>Log end offset:</strong> the exclusive upper bound offset for the log</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-state-generator"><a id="initial-state-generator"></a>Initial state generator</h2>
<p>Every property test run must start with an initial state—in this case, a model of the log. To create this initial state, we define an initial state generator. The primary behavior that we are testing for is the correct behavior of retention logic. Two critical configurations for this behavior are <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#retention.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retention.ms</a></code> (retention according to time) and <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms</a></code> (hotset retention). See below for a visualization of how hotset retention causes a Tiered Storage based log to span the tiered set and the local hotset data. Our initial state generator will generate configurations for these settings and an initial state.<br>

<pre>Generator:
retentionMs &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](0, 200)
hotsetRetentionMs &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](0, 50) config = Map("retention.bytes" -&gt; Long.MaxValue,
             "retention.ms" -&gt; retentionMs,
             "confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" -&gt; hotsetRetentionMs)

SUT:
log = new Log(generatedConfig)

Model state:
logStartOffset = 0
logEndOffset = 0
config = generatedConfig
segments = [SegmentState(baseOffset = 0, nextOffset = 0, maxTimestamps = None)]
deletedLocalSegments = []
tieredSegments = []
deletedTieredSegments = []
committedEndOffset = -1
</pre>
<h2 id="action-generator"><a id="action-generator"></a>Action generator</h2>
<p>The log property tests generate different sub-actions at various frequencies, ensuring that more common operations are performed more frequently in proportion to the number listed for each action. Descriptions of these actions will follow.</p>
<pre>Gen.frequency(
  (20, Append),
  (20, AdvanceHighWatermark),
  (20, Read),
  (10, AdvanceTime),
  (10, IncrementLogStartOffset),
  (10, TierUploadSegment),
  (10, RollSegment),
  (10, CommitTierState),
  (10, Retention),
  (10, TierRetention),
  (1, CloseAndReopen))
</pre>
<h2 id="append"><a id="append"></a><code>Append</code></h2>
<p><code>Append</code> generates a record batch of different record types, with a bounded range of timestamps and various compression choices. The generated record batch is then appended to the SUT log.<br>
The model state is updated to advance the log end offset and accumulate the records that have been appended.</p>
<pre>Action: Append(generatedRecords):

Generators:
CompressionType:
Gen.oneOf(CompressionType.NONE, CompressionType.SNAPPY, CompressionType.GZIP, CompressionType.LZ4)

Record:
timestamp &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](baseTimestamp, minTimestamp)
key &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))
value &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))

RecordBatch:
magic &lt;- Gen.oneOf(RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V0, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V1, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V2)

SUT action:
log.appendAsLeader(generatedRecordBatch)

Model action:
activeSegment.append(generatedRecordBatch)
records.add(generatedRecordBatch)
logEndOffset = logEndOffset :+ generatedRecordBatch.size
</pre>
<h2 id="advancehighwatermark"><code><a id="advancehighwatermark"></a>AdvanceHighWatermark</code></h2>
<p><code>AdvanceHighWatermark</code> simulates the movement of the high watermark (HWM). In Apache Kafka, high watermark increases occur as follower replicas fetch data from the leader.<br>
The high watermark affects several behaviors of the log. For example, it dictates the upper bounds of allowable retention, segments eligible for tiering, and log start offset movement resulting from <code>DeleteRecords</code> API calls.</p>
<p>Due to how Apache Kafka performs offset translation, we limit high watermark movements such that they align with record batch base offsets or the log end offset. The reason for this will be discussed later.</p>
<pre>Action: AdvanceHighwatermark(newHighwatermark):

SUT action:
log.updateHighWatermark(newHwm)

Model:
hwm = newHwm
</pre>
<h2 id="rollsegment"><code><a id="rollsegment"></a>RollSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>RollSegment</code> forces a segment roll on the SUT’s log. This is necessary because we set <code>segment.bytes</code> and <code>segment.ms</code> to their maximum possible values, given that this logic is currently unimplemented in the model. When it is implemented, this action will no longer be required.</p>
<pre>Action: RollSegment()

Log action:
Log.roll()

Model:
Create a new empty active segment if the existing active segment is empty
</pre>
<h2 id="tieruploadsegment"><code><a id="tieruploadsegment"></a>TierUploadSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>TierUploadSegment</code> checks whether any segments meet the necessary conditions for tiering and then simulates an upload of the segment to object storage. The candidate segment must meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment must not be the active segment</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be greater than the log start offset</li>
<li>The segment is the first tierable segment that has not otherwise been tiered</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be below the high watermark</li>
</ul>
<pre>Action: TierUploadSegment()

Log action:
simulateUpload(firstTierableSegment)

Model:
tieredSegments.add(firstTierableSegment)
</pre>
<h2 id="committierstate"><code><a id="committierstate"></a>CommitTierState</code></h2>
<p>Tiered logs contain local state consisting of metadata for tiered segments. Confluent Server achieves safety of the overall log by preventing deletion of any local segment covered by tiered segments until after this state has been safely committed (flushed).</p>
<pre>Action: CommitTierState()

Log action:
log.tierPartitionState.flush()

Model:
committedEndOffset = tieredSegments.last.endOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="incrementlogstartoffset"><code><a id="incrementlogstartoffset"></a>IncrementLogStartOffset</code></h2>
<p>The <code>IncrementLogStartOffset</code> action simulates two behaviors in Apache Kafka. The first is when an application or user uses the <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeleteRecords</a></code>API to advance the log start offset. The second is when a leader has a higher log start offset than the follower, which will trigger the advance of the log start offset via the replication protocol.</p>
<pre>Action: IncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset: Long)
Generated:
newLogStartOffset &lt;- Gen.chooseNum(state.logStartOffset, state.highWatermark)

Log action:
log.maybeIncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset, ClientRecordDeletion)

Model:
logStartOffset = newLogStartOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="retention"><code><a id="retention"></a>Retention</code></h2>
<p><code>Retention</code> applies Apache Kafka’s local log retention to the SUT in the following order of application:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>retention.ms</code></li>
<li><code>retention.bytes</code></li>
<li>log start offset</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of log start offset retention, any segments lower than the log start offset will be deleted. The retention action must be careful not to delete any local segments that are not deletable due to data that has been tiered. For example, if any tiered segments past the start offset are not deletable, then any following local segments will not be deletable.</p>
<pre>Action: Retention()

Log action:
log.deleteOldSegments()

Model:
Apply retention time retention
Advance the log start offset if any local segments have been deleted
Apply log start offset retention
Apply hotset time retention
</pre>
<h2 id="tierretention"><code><a id="tierretention"></a>TierRetention</code></h2>
<p>The <code>TierRetention</code> action performs retention for the tiered portion of the log. <code>TierRetention</code> is similar to normal log retention, except it is responsible for deletion of the section of the log that has been tiered.</p>
<pre>Action: TierRetention()

Log action:
log.tierDeleteOldSegments()

Model:
Delete the first tiered segment if it is below the log start offset or if maxTimestamp &lt; currentTimeMs - retention.ms
</pre>
<h2 id="closeandreopen"><code><a id="closeandreopen"></a>CloseAndReopen</code></h2>
<p><code>CloseAndReopen</code> closes the log and reopens it. It is important to test the opening of the log as it re-initializes critical variables and may perform log <code>recovery</code> if the log was not closed cleanly. If the generated recover variable is true, the log will be forced to perform log recovery from the beginning of the log as if it were not closed cleanly. This rebuilds in-memory epoch and producer states from local segments rather than restoring them from checkpointed states on disk.</p>
<pre>Action: CloseAndReopen(recover: Boolean)

Log action:
log.close()
new Log(recoveryOffset)

Model:
No action
</pre>
<h2 id="read"><code><a id="read"></a>Read</code></h2>
<p><code>Read</code> performs a read of the log starting at an offset under a particular isolation mode. The offset affects the starting point of the read, and isolation action affects the data that is allowed to be returned by the fetch. For example, for <code>FetchHighWatermark</code>, only records below the high watermark are allowed to be returned.</p>
<p><code>Read</code> is implemented here as an action rather than as a property check for two reasons. The first is that checking every potential combination of <code>fetchOffset</code> and <code>isolation</code> after every action will be expensive. Secondly, reads can affect the behavior of the log by advancing high watermarks, triggering values to be …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the exposed employee records that Sakura Samurai managed to access during our security research through their vulnerability disclosure program.</p><p>Reading time: 3 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>We noticed that The United Nations had a Vulnerability Disclosure Program and a Hall of Fame, therefore Sakura Samurai 桜の侍 our security research group, set out to look for vulnerabilities to report to the United Nations. During the research process Jackson Henry @JacksonHHax , Nick Sahler, John Jackson @johnjhacking and Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner identified an endpoint that exposed Git Credentials. The credentials gave us the ability to download the Git Repositories, identifying a ton of user credentials and PII. In total, we identified over 100K+ private employee records. We also discovered multiple exposed .git directories on UN owned web servers [ilo.org], the .git contents could then be exfiltrated with various tools such as “git-dumper”.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Records [Two Documents: 102,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/travel-records.png" alt=""><br>
Travel Records Included Employee ID Numbers, Names, Employee Groups, Travel Justification, Start and End Dates, Length of Stay, Approval Status, Destination and the Length of the stay.</p>
<p><strong>HR Nationality Demographics [Two Documents: 7,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/nationality-records.png" alt=""><br>
Included Employee Name, Employee Group, Employee ID Numbers, Person’s Nationality, Person’s Gender, Employee Pay Grade, Organization Work Unit Identification Number and Organization Unit Text Tags.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Employee Records [One document: 1,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/hr-records.png" alt=""><br>
Index Numbers, Employee Names, Employee Emails, Employee Work Subareas and Employee Org Units. Note: The column with the “Red number 1” represent the Employee’s specific work department and was blurred as some of the sub-units are smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Project and Funding Source Records [One Document: 4,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/project-funding.png" alt=""><br>
Included Project Identification Number, Affected Areas, Grant and Co-financing amounts, Implementing Agencies, Countries, Funding Sources, Period of the Project and if the Project/Concept was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Reports [One Document: 283 Projects]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/eval-reports.png" alt=""><br>
Overall descriptions of the Evaluations and Reports, Periods Conducted and a link to the report on the project.</p>

<p>In addition, on the lesser side of severity, we managed to takeover a SQL Database and a Survey Management Platform belonging to the International Labour Organization - also in the UN’s VDP program scope. However, it was of note that the ILO vulnerabilities were of little prominence as the Database and Survey Management platform were fairly abandoned in nature and contained hardly anything of use. Nonetheless, a Database takeover and admin account takeover on a platform are still Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We had performed subdomain enumeration of all of the domains in scope for the VDP offered by the UN. During our research, we began to fuzz multiple endpoints with tooling and initially discovered that an ilo.org subdomain had an exposed .git contents. Utilizing git-dumper [<a href="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper" title="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper"><strong>https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper</strong></a>] we were able to dump the project folders hosted on the web application, resulting in the takeover of a MySQL database and of  survey management platform due to exposed credentials within the code.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL Credentials</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sql.png" alt=""><br>
Note:</strong> <em>We will not provide a picture of the survey platform due to the specific nature of the application.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After we had taken over one of the International Labour Organization’s MySQL Databases and performed account takeover on the survey management platform, we began to enumerate other domains/subdomains.</p>
<p>Eventually, we found a subdomain on the United Nations Environment Programme that allowed us to discover github credentials after a bit of fuzzing.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/git.png" alt=""><br>
Ultimately, once we discovered the GitHub credentials, we were able to download a lot of private password-protected GitHub projects and within the projects we found multiple sets of database and application credentials for the UNEP production environment. In total, we found <strong>7 additional credential-pairs</strong> which could have resulted in unauthorized access of multiple databases. We decided to stop and report this vulnerability once we were able to access PII that was exposed via Database backups that were in the private projects.</p>

The pandemic pushed us to use the internet in new ways: digital doctor visits, first dates and family dinners over Zoom, grocery shopping via apps.</p>  <p>The pandemic has not only magnified the value of the internet, but also what's <em>wrong</em> with it. Newsfeeds that spread misinformation. Digital ads that track and target us. Algorithms that make opaque decisions about our credit ratings or our dating lives. Smart speakers that listen to —&nbsp;and store —&nbsp;our every word.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In short: the internet is indispensable&nbsp;— and imperfect.</p>  <p>At this fraught moment in our digital society, Canada has a major opportunity to address much of what's wrong online. Several weeks ago, Canadian legislators in the House of Commons introduced<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/P9TMCG922fJDMJvSKIpFD?domain=parl.ca" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading" target="_blank"><u>Bill C-11</u></a> to <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act</a>.</p>  <p>Bill C-11 embodies the principles of Canada's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/00119.html" target="_blank"><u>Digital Charter</u></a>, which envisions the internet as a tool for both innovation <em>and</em> the public good. And it hints at an internet where individual Canadians, not big tech platforms, are in full control of their data.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Of course, Bill C-11 is just that —&nbsp;a bill, not yet a law. It holds a great deal of promise, but it needs serious improvements if it is to live up to the vision outlined in the Digital Charter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Canada is at an inflection point. We can improve this law so that it truly protects and empowers Canadians, giving us control over our relationship with Big Tech, gig economy companies and retailers who constantly track us online. Or, we can pass a law that makes a show of protecting privacy, but leaves many of the worst problems with the internet —&nbsp;limited consumer agency, no accountability for Big Tech —&nbsp; unsolved and unchecked.&nbsp;</p>  <p>For C-11 to succeed, we need movement on three fronts.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bill C-11 includes privacy-protection measures such as the right to opt out of having personal data collected by third parties.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Rick Bowmer/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>First, we need to make sure the new rights the bill offers Canadians are clear and actionable.</p>  <p>What the bill includes so far is quite promising, things like the right to an explanation of why an artificial intelligence (AI) made a decision about me, or the right to opt out of having my data collected in the first place.</p>  <p>These things may sound abstract, but could have huge benefits in our everyday lives. Imagine if you could press a button to understand why Amazon or an airline is giving you a different price today than it did yesterday (an AI did that!). Or if you could join a points program at a store and understand why you received certain promotions but not others.</p>    <p>For instance, grocery or retail points programs often tailor rewards to match the foods and products that members of the program purchase most often, meaning that different people receive different discounts based on the data that has been collected. While this might seem more efficient, it also creates inequality as people that do not use a program's app cannot access the same modest discounts on everyday essentials available to a member. Simply having better explanations available for why someone is receiving a discount offer, similar to Facebook's "Why am I seeing this ad?" feature, could be helpful.</p>  <p>The rights in C-11 have the potential to drive changes like these. Yet, as we have seen with similar laws in Europe, real change is hard to come by.</p>  <p>Clear lines in the law and public education about digital rights will be essential if Canadians are going to use and benefit from them.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/online-shopping-534050776.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4915106.1542831393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/online-shopping-534050776.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The new digital privacy protection legislation is vague about how enforcement will work.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Kite_rin/Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The second front crucial to the bill's success? Strong enforcement and accountability.</p>  <p>This is another place where Bill C-11 is at once promising and worrying. While Bill C-11 provides new order-making powers to the Privacy Commissioner and allows fines up to $25 million or 5 per cent of a firm's gross revenue, it's vague about how all of this will work.</p>    <p>Looking again to Europe and laws such as the<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/i2EfCK622TqXnqVS3Pmub?domain=gdpr-info.eu" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank"><u>General Data Protection Regulation</u></a> (GDPR), we see that they only work if entities like the Privacy Commissioner are incredibly well resourced. And as a report from browser developer Brave demonstrated, European governments have&nbsp;<a href="https://brave.com/dpa-report-2020/" target="_blank"><u>not equipped their national authorities to enforce the GDPR</u></a>.</p>  <p>Canadian lawmakers must learn from this example and lay out a plan to invest&nbsp; accordingly. And they must resist the temptation to shift the enforcement burden to consumers —&nbsp;it is time to relieve us of reviewing the Terms and Conditions of every single app.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/laptop.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/laptop.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/laptop.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/laptop.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/laptop.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5149509.1610403451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/laptop.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Unlike legislation in some other jurisdictions around the world, Canada's digital consumer privacy law lacks a mechanism for collective representation when there is an issue that affects a group of people. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Shutterstock/Dan74)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The third front where we need progress is collective rights and intermediaries —&nbsp;giving Canadians the option to demand more from Big Tech collectively rather than on their own.</p>  <p>Just like pollution, abuse of data affects individuals <em>and</em> the collective. When we're on Facebook or YouTube, your data is mixed with my data. In order to get better treatment from online services, we need a way to push for our rights together, not just as individuals. Otherwise, the burden on individuals to manage their digital privacy will remain absurdly high.</p>  <p>Imagine if your Amazon shopping history and habits lived not on Amazon, but in something like a co-op or credit union that you belonged to. You could decide how much of that data Amazon gets to see —&nbsp;and how much you want to hold back.</p>  <p>California's consumer privacy law includes a mechanism for this kind of collective representation. And, in a recent proposal by the EU Commission, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2102" target="_blank"><u>Europe is considering something similar.</u></a></p>  <p>However, Bill C-11 completely ignores this topic, much to the detriment of Canadians. We've seen how structures like cooperatives have helped to solve power imbalances throughout Canadian history, and our legislators should take inspiration from them as we continue to re-imagine appropriate data governance.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Canada's new online privacy legislation is encouraging, but there is much more work to be done to ensure that our digital society works for all of us. There's plenty of data out there on the best practices related to privacy and data management, and our new framework should leverage all of it.</p>  <p>Canada has the ability to put its people in charge of their own data. Bill C-11 is an opportunity to manifest the principles of the Digital Charter in a way that has an impact on millions of Canadians —&nbsp;and sets an example that ripples beyond our borders.</p>  <hr>  <ul>   <li><strong>This column is part of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion">CBC's Opinion section</a>.

<p>Developers hate legacy code. It’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s ugly, it’s messy, it’s… old. But we shouldn’t have a negative outlook on legacy or old code. It’s there for a reason, we just need to appreciate that reason.</p>



<p>When starting a new job and getting your first look at the legacy codebase, it’s easy to be frightened or disgusted. If the code has been around for a long time (in Internet years), it probably doesn’t meet modern style guides or follow modern practices. We can easily look at this code and deem it inferior to the code that is being written presently. To do so, though, is to disrespect the developers and the decisions that came before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<em>Legacy code is established</em>“</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>We need to reframe our minds and stop hating and disrespecting legacy code and instead appreciate it for what it is: legacy code is established. The lines you’re judging are there for a reason; they have lasted the test of time; they have served a purpose. Most importantly of all, they have given you a job. Without those “old” or “ugly” lines of code, you would not have the job that you’re using now to put down that very code.</p>



<p>Programmers don’t set out with the intention of writing bad or ugly code. They don’t sit down and think of the most convoluted solution they can write. Code becomes complex, intertwined, and unpleasant over time. Each feature begins with a single typed character and builds from there. As the business grows and its needs change, so does the code. </p>



<p>A friend of mine once said that “bad” code is the product of not enough time, poorly defined requirements, or inexperience, not necessarily a bad programmer. Business moves fast and as developers, we’re constantly working against the clock to release features to draw in customers and make more money. It’s for these reasons that we must change how we think about and see legacy code – it is not something to be looked down upon, it is a legacy that was passed down to us that we must now carry forward for the next generation of programmers. When we are handed a legacy codebase, it becomes ours to shepherd forward.</p>



<p>Build and improve upon the legacy, but overall, respect it.</p>

<p>A Tesla Model Y Standard Range is spotted with the heated steering wheel option activated. This useful feature for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/cold-weather/">cold weather</a> is not found in the earlier versions of the Model Ys delivered since last year. Tesla has not yet officially advertised this feature in the online configurator or via an official tweet. </p>



<p>But Tesla has got a large and vibrant community across the social media sphere news outlets like ours to publicize the hidden features and upgrades for the company.</p>



<p>The Kilowatts / Twitter seems to be the first Tesla owner finding out about the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> heated steering feature in a recently launched cheapest version of the  Model Y named <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/08/model-y-rwd-3rd-row-leaked-photos-model-3-compare/">Standard Range RWD</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, like Tesla always does, the feature was added to the vehicle for no extra cost or hiking the price of the existing variants. Tesla is one of the few companies in the world right now to implement the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/19/model-y-sandy-munro-verdict/#deming-cycle">continuous improvement cycle</a> on the factory floor in its true sense.</p>



<p>The following video shows how to turn the heated steering wheel ON or OFF by tapping the climate icon (the fan icon) on the center touchscreen. When the climate control menu pops up, you need to tap the squiggly lines icon on the left to bring up the seat and steering heater controls, now you can turn the heated steering by tapping the tab with the steering icon.</p>

</amp-ad>
</figure>



<p>The introduction of the heated steering wheel for the Model Y and even for the base variant might be a step taken to give Volkswagen ID.4 a more tough competition in the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/tesla-in-europe/">European</a> and US market. Tesla China has upgraded the locally made <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the heated steering wheel but we have yet to witness this on a Fremont made US Model 3.</p>



<p>It’s not clear though if Tesla is going to give existing owners the option for a heated steering wheel retrofit, we will soon find out and let you know.</p>



<p>To fight cold weather, Tesla also recently launched a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/13/tesla-introduces-the-new-model-y-20-winter-wheels-and-tire-package/">winter tire and wheels package</a> for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a>.</p>



<p>On a side note, a large number of Tesla <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Model S</a>, 3, X, and Y cars are spotted at a rented parking lot in Dublin, California — seems Q1 2021 has started strongly for Tesla (TSLA) after the record Q4 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We love Hetzner ❤️. </p>



<p>They have a great offering with a lot of stability and great prices. Therefore we basically provide all our services from within one of the many german datacenters. Running our Kubernetes Cluster with them was no question and one year after our first experiments with Kubernetes, we can even see a tight integration with all the Hetzner Cloud Services.</p>



<p>Hetzner currently offers the following cloud services we want to make use of in our Clusters:</p>



<ul><li>Servers (obviously)</li><li>Volumes</li><li>Private Networks</li><li>Load Balancers</li><li>DNS API (not a part of the Cloud offering but important)</li></ul>



<p>Since we are already running multiple Clusters (production, staging &amp; testing) and expect to run even more in the future, as well as the ease of usage we have with it, we are using Rancher and the RKE K8s distribution.</p>



<p>How to setup a rancher instance is pretty well documented around the internet and our recommendation is to start off with a single node install using k3s/rke/microK8s which can then expanded as you go: <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/">https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/</a></p>



<p>After you have setup the rancher instance, the Hetzner fun begins. The expectation here is that you already are familiar with the Hetzner UI and where to find your API Token and all the features we are talking about. For this way of setting up Rancher and Clusters, we don’t need them to be in the same project. We are recommending one project per cluster you plan to spin up.</p>



<p>All instructions are written as of 12th January 2021 and user Rancher v2.5.</p>



<h2>Rancher Node Driver</h2>



<p>First of we need to give Rancher the ability to spin new nodes (Cloud Servers) up and down. For this we are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/JonasProgrammer/docker-machine-driver-hetzner">Hetzner Cloud Docker machine driver</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mxschmitt/ui-driver-hetzner">custom UI plugin for Rancher</a>. <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/hcloud-install-rancher-single#step-4---setup-hetzner-cloud-node-driver">Set the Node Driver up in the Global Rancher View</a>, then go on to configure the first <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/user-settings/node-templates/">node templates</a> in your user profile. Here you need a API token from the project you want the cluster to be in.</p>



<p>Create a private network in the Hetzner Cloud UI and select it in the node template, but don’t select the private network to be used here in the UI, we will do that later.</p>



<p>We recommend one template for the Control Plane and etcd Servers with at least CX21 Servers and another template for the workers wich should realistically also at least be CX21. </p>



<p>Add a label to the worker node template which we will need later for the load balancer. We are using <code>mecodia.cloud/type=worker</code> but it doesn’t really matter. </p>



<p>Save the template and create your first cluster.</p>



<h2>Cluster Creation</h2>



<p>Create a cluster in Rancher. If you are using the cluster seriously start of with 3 management (Control Plane &amp; etcd) servers and 3 worker servers otherwise read up on the pros and cons of having less than 3 management servers.</p>



<p>Now we get to the juicy part of the cluster creation. In the form select cloud provider external and then change into the yaml edit view. Here we need to add some additional info for Rancher and RKE. We use the <code>addons</code> and <code>addones_include</code> directives to setup the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> after we have the nodes ready. </p>



<p>In theory we could also setup other <code>addons</code> here like cert-manager, but since <code>addons_include</code> are resolved and saved into etcd we can only save 1.5 MBytes of data, while cert-manager yamls alone consume 1.6 MBytes.</p>



<pre><code>rancher_kubernetes_engine_config:
  cloud_provider:
    name: external
  addons: |-
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: hcloud
      namespace: kube-system
    stringData:
      token: "API_TOKEN"
      network: "PRIVATE_NETWORK_ID"
  addons_include:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager.yaml
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-csi-driver.yaml</code></pre>



<p>You can find all files we use here and changed in our github repository: <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base">https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base</a></p>



<p>In difference to the yaml files provided by <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> we use the <code>HCLOUD_NETWORK</code> environment variable which enabled the Cloud Controller to tell Kubernetes the internal IP of the Node without attaching the network, because we already did that on node setup or using it for inter pod communication, which we leave that up to our chosen network CNI plugin.</p>



<p>We also deploy the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/">Hetzner CSI Driver</a> into our cluster as the default storage class for <code>PersistentVolumeStorage</code>. The difference to the original yaml is that we use the same secret for the Cloud Controller and the CSI Driver. With the CSI Driver installed we can make use of persistent volume claims in our statefullset deployments like databases or bucket storage.</p>



<p>After you are done, hit the create button at the bottom of the page and wait for the cluster to be ready. This will take a while (between 5 to 10 minutes) until the cluster is completely ready. In the meanwhile we can go back to the Hetzner Cloud UI and setup the Load Balancer.</p>



<h2>The Load Balancer</h2>



<p>To have access to our cluster we have to setup at least one load balancer. In the Hetzner Cloud UI create a new Load Balancer in the same project as the rest of the cluster. Select the same region as your servers and select the same private network. Create a new target by label and use the label you setup for your worker nodes in the node templates. Also select to use the private network.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1014" height="918" src="https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image.png 1014w, https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image-300x272.png 300w, https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image-768x695.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px"></figure>



<p>Create two tcp services, one from and to port 80 (HTTP) and one from and to port 443 (HTTPS). In both cases activate the proxy protocol. Choose a algorithm and a name and hit the create button.</p>



<p>This way we have a single IP into our cluster while also having load balancing capabilities. SSL Termination happens on the ingress which allows us to run cert-manager and aquire LetsEncrypt Cerificates, but we loose the ability to have sticky sessions. You have to decide which tradeoff you want, but the setup works for 90% of cases.</p>



<h2>HTTPS Certificates for our Cluster wildcard certificates</h2>



<p>Speaking of HTTPS Certificates, we check if our cluster already is in a ready state and has finished setting up. If the cluster is ready we can install <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/">cert-manager</a> through one of the documented ways. After that we install the <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/cert-manager-webhook-hetzner">cert-manager-webhook-hetzner</a> in the same namespace. This is highly important and will possibly break the webhook if not done correctly.</p>



<p>After we have finished this setup we can setup our ClusterIssuers with Hetzner DNS for wildcard certificates or just simple certificates.</p>



<pre><code>apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-production
spec:
  acme:
    email: YOU_MAIL_HERE
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: acme-production-issuer-account-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: dns.hetzner.cloud
            solverName: hetzner
            config:
              APIKey: HETZNER_DNS_API_TOKEN
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsign
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
</code></pre>



<p>We also add a selfsigned certificate ClusterIssuer into the mix we can use to generate certificates for other internal services like Databases and others.</p>



<p>Now you can generate Certificates for <code>Ingress</code> resources and validate those either via <code>dns01</code> or <code>http01</code> challenges by using the annotations:</p>



<pre><code>annotations:
  cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production</code></pre>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Now our basic Hetzner cluster setup is done and tightly integrated with all Hetzner services we want to use:</p>



<p><strong>Servers</strong> are deployed by Rancher with the docker-machine driver.</p>



<p><strong>Volumes</strong> are provisioned and managed by the CSI Driver</p>



<p>All our cluster internal traffic is routed through our <strong>private network</strong></p>



<p>The<strong> Load Balancer </strong>is the (web) entrance to our (auto-scaling) cluster and can also be used in ingress deployment by using <code>type: LoadBalancer</code></p>



<p>We provision LetsEncrypt Certificates to our ingresses with the help of the <strong>Hetzner DNS API</strong>.</p>



<p>There are some caveats to this setup, as the LoadBalancer deployed as ingress is not yet as finely tuned as other clouds load balancers and will just target all servers. The private network is only used for node communication with an overlay network for pod communication. Other than that, we are pretty happy with the setup and will probably have more than one cluster running with that setup.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We are experiencing some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deadliest days</span></a> in American history, but the magnitude of the ongoing disaster defies human comprehension. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>These circles represent some of the deadliest days (from a single cause) in the last 100 years.</p>
<h4><strong><br>Declining Searches for “Cases” and “Deaths”</strong></h4>
<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

                <p>I was 12 years old when I first heard about SQL triggers. My brother, Jonathan, had just begun his software career at a startup. Jonathan came home one day frustrated by a database full of convoluted SQL triggers.</p><p>With my only programming experience being recreating my favorite video game in VB6, I had little consolation to offer.</p><p>Fast forward 16 years, and now I can see from my brother’s perspective. In the world of open source start-up style full-stack development (think Django, Rails, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Postgres..), ORMs are very popular and features like SQL triggers are far less conventional.</p><p>But there is still value with SQL triggers. During my time working on custom ERP-like software, SQL triggers were an invaluable tool. When building highly data oriented software, especially when the data is of financial nature and accuracy is of high demand, you're more likely to see data being manipulated at a lower level, in a more direct way.</p><p>This article contains all the information I wish I could have shared with my brother on how to effectively use SQL triggers.</p><h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-create-a-sql-trigger-postgres-syntax">How to Create a SQL Trigger - Syntax</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example 1: Creating a Time Clock</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example 2: Creating an Audit Table</a></li><li><a href="#additional-considerations-for-triggers">Additional Considerations for Triggers</a></li></ul><h2 id="what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</h2><p>SQL Triggers, also called Database Triggers, allow you to tell your SQL engine (for these examples, Postgres) to run a piece of code when an event happens, or even before the event.</p><p>In Postgres, you delineate the code to run by creating a function whose return type is <code>trigger</code>. In some other engines like MySQL, the code block is a part of and inside the trigger.</p><p>Before I discuss what the different event types are and the specific syntax for creating a trigger, why would you want to use a database trigger? </p><h3 id="advantages-of-using-sql-triggers">Advantages of using SQL Triggers</h3><h5 id="maintaining-data-integrity">Maintaining data integrity</h5><p>Database triggers have a variety of uses and are an excellent tool to marshal strict data integrity. Alternate solutions like Django's model hooks may fail if you have other application servers or users accessing the database who aren't aware of the specific business logic coded in your application.</p><h5 id="separating-business-logic">Separating business logic</h5><p>Coding critical business logic within the application code also presents problems when the business logic is updated. If you had a business requirement to multiply an incoming number by 10, and you wanted to revise this logic to multiply the number by 20, changing the logic in SQL would guarantee that every piece of data from that exact deploy time on would be affected by the new logic.</p><p>The SQL server acts as a single point of truth.

Here are some examples of different events that can activate a trigger:</p><ul><li>Changing data: <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code></li></ul><p>A database trigger can also list more than one of these events.</p><p>If <code>UPDATE</code> was one of the listed events, you can pass in a list of columns that should activate the trigger. If you don't include this list, updating any column will activate it.</p><h3 id="trigger-before-or-after">Trigger <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code></h3><p>A trigger can run either <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code> an event.</p><p>If you want to block an event like an <code>INSERT</code>, you will want to run <code>BEFORE</code>. If you need to be sure the event actually is going to occur, <code>AFTER</code> is ideal.</p><h3 id="effect-of-the-trigger">Effect of the trigger</h3><p>A trigger can run either per row, or per statement. Let's say you run a single <code>UPDATE</code> statement that changes 5 rows in a table. </p><p>If you specify <code>FOR EACH ROW</code> in the trigger, then the trigger will run 5 times. If you specified <code>FOR EACH STATEMENT</code>, then it would only run once.</p><p>And of course we can't forget the actual code to run when the trigger is activated. In Postgres, is placed in a function and separated from the trigger. Separating the trigger from the code it runs creates cleaner code and allows multiple triggers to execute the same code.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example #1: Creating a Time Clock</h2><p>A time clock records when an employee comes and leaves from work and calculates his/her total hours worked.

join time_punch tp2
on tp2.id = (

where tp1.employee_id = 1
and tp1.is_out_punch</code></pre><pre><code>time_worked
-------------
 01:30:00
(1 row)</code></pre><p>In this query I select all the out punches, then I join them to the closest preceding "in" punch. Subtract the timestamps, and we get how many hours Bear worked for each shift! </p><p>One of the issues with this schema is that it is possible for you to insert several "in" or "out" punches in a row.

First we'll create the "trigger function". This function is what the trigger will execute when the event type is detected. </p><p>A trigger function is created like a regular Postgres function, except that it returns a <code>trigger</code>.</p><pre><code>create or replace function fn_check_time_punch() returns trigger as $psql$

      select tps.is_out_punch

    ) then
      return null;
    end if;
    return new;
  end;
$psql$ language plpgsql;
</code></pre><p>The <code>new</code> keyword represents the values of the row that is to be inserted. It also is the object you can return to allow the insert to continue. Alternatively, when <code>null</code> is returned this stops the insertion.</p><p>This query finds the <code>time_punch</code> before and ensures its in/out value is not the same as what's being inserted. If the values are the same, then the trigger returns <code>null</code> and the time_punch is not recorded. Otherwise, the trigger returns <code>new</code> and the <code>insert</code> statement is allowed to continue.</p><p>Now we'll link the function as a trigger to the <code>time_punch</code> table. <code>BEFORE</code> is crucial here. If we ran this trigger as an <code>AFTER</code> trigger it would run too late to stop the insertion.</p><pre><code>create trigger check_time_punch before insert on time_punch for each row execute procedure fn_check_time_punch();
</code></pre><p>Let's try to insert another "out" punch:</p><pre><code>insert into time_punch (employee_id, is_out_punch, punch_time)
values
(1, true, '2020-01-01 13:00:00');</code></pre><pre><code>Output:
INSERT 0 0</code></pre><p>We can see from the output that the trigger prevented the insertion of two subsequent out punches for the same employee.</p><p>It is also possible to raise an exception from the trigger so that your application (or person running the SQL query) receives a failure notice instead of the insert count simply being 0.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example #2: Creating an Audit Table</h2><p>Accurately storing employee punch data is critical for businesses.

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<![CDATA[Using GPT-3 for plain language incident root cause from logs]]>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-131">

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Data has gone from being a sparse resource to a commodity. Many companies try to collect as much data as possible, leading to questions about the best way to keep data.</p><p><strong>Data warehouses allow companies to keep their data in one, unified place. Data warehouses are capable of storing large amounts of data at an affordable rate.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Data warehousing has become an increasingly common tool in digital companies. But we already have databases capable of storing large amounts of data. So why are data warehouses such a big deal?&nbsp;</p><h3>The problem with datasets<br></h3><p>Before data warehouses became popular, datasets were stored in separate places. Some datasets were incompatible with other datasets and couldn’t be used for the same analysis. In other cases, datasets were owned by third-party providers, who offered only limited interaction with the data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Why did this happen? Data originates from different places. For example, you may keep a database with all the information related to your product such as account credentials, profile information, product information, etc. But you also have a database for keeping track of the interaction users have with your product. On top of that, you could be gathering information on business-related topics such as financials, emails with leads, marketing clicks, and so on. At the moment of creation, one database seems to have no relation to another database.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Eventually, companies started to notice that interacting with each dataset individually was too clunky. Companies wanted the ability to maintain this information in one, unified place. This is exactly what data warehouses were created to do. When all your data is in one place and in the same format, you may synthesize data from various levels of organization and conduct a holistic analysis. Data warehouses have fundamentally changed the way companies gather and analyze data.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>How to leverage data warehouses?</h3><p>Once you have a data warehouse, there are two main avenues for analysis:</p><ul role="list"><li>Business Intelligence tools &amp; SQL queries</li><li>Automated Analytics &amp; Business Analysis tools</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>Business Intelligence &amp; SQL queries</h4><p>In order to answer specific business questions with a data warehouse, you need to know SQL. SQL gives you the flexibility of querying the data in virtually any way but with the drawback of requiring coding skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Most popular Business Intelligence tools are <a href="https://chartio.com/">Chartio</a>, <a href="https://mode.com/">Mode</a>, <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a>, <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/">Google Data Studio</a>. At Lantern, we particularly like new players such as <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> and <a href="https://popsql.com/">PopSQL</a>.<br></p><p>In order to let non-technical roles gain insight from data, companies traditionally rely on data analysts. However, as more and more roles need frequent access to company data, data analysts have become a bottleneck.</p><h4>Automated Analysis tools<br></h4><p>This increasing reliance on data insights by non-technical roles has created a space for a new breed of products: automated data analysis tools. <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">Lantern</a> is a part of this group. Data warehouses offer easy and structured access to all the data of the company, which is a perfect setup for automated tools to offer simple answers on specific topics.<br></p><p>Automated tools do not require SQL or a data analyst to answer your questions. This combination returns control to both technical or non-technical data consumers alike.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The category of automated analysis tools is relatively new and has been well-received by companies. Besides Lantern, which focuses on serving startup product teams, other automated analysis tools target various teams in larger enterprises such as <a href="https://www.anodot.com/">Anodot</a>, <a href="https://sisudata.com/">Sisu</a>, and <a href="https://outlier.ai/">Outlier</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Warehouses have transformed the way modern companies use data. You can now afford to track all your data in the same place. This unlocks a whole new level of analysis, allowing you to put data together from various points or perform a more holistic analysis.<br></p><p>A key win enabled by data warehouses has been the emergence of a new breed: automated analysis tools, which pro-actively send you insights about changes in your data.<br></p><p>If you are interested in giving a try to such an automated analysis tool for user behavior and product usage, you can access Lantern's early access program <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">here</a>.<br></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter</p><div><div><p>Thank you!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This is the third annual release of my “<a href="https://summitroute.com/downloads/aws_security_maturity_roadmap-Summit_Route.pdf">AWS Security Maturity Roadmap</a>” to give companies a series or actionable steps to improve the security of their AWS environments. Each year I update this with the latest features of AWS, along with improvements based on my discussions with clients, other consultants, and more who have gone through some of these activities or encountered challenges, or have mentioned new ideas.  This includes companies of all sizes, risk tolerances, and integration (from lift and shift to completely serverless).</p>

<p>Changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added that your root email addresses should be under your company domain and on email distribution lists as I’ve found many accounts during assessments that were associated with old aol.com emails and other personal accounts. This is how AWS communicates with you and is an important part of account recovery.</li>
  <li>Added <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2021/01/06/opting_out_of_aws_ai_data_usage/">opting out</a> of the AI services from sending your data outside of the regions you put it in.</li>
  <li>Added budget alarms to Stage 1. Although less likely to provide as much value for larger enterprises, these are very important for individuals and small businesses. Also mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/preview-anomaly-detection-and-alerting-now-available-in-aws-cost-management/">Cost Anomaly Detection</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/get-started-with-aws-budgets-actions/">Budget Actions</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that you should consider using GuardDuty’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/identify-unintended-resource-access-with-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-access-analyzer/">S3 monitoring</a>, which for monitoring, is as an alternative to Macie.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-aws-cloudformation-stacksets-for-multiple-accounts-in-an-aws-organization/">CloudFormation StackSets with Organizations</a> which is an Organization feature that deploys a CloudFormation StackSet whenever a new account is created to ensure it is initialized with your baseline.</li>
  <li>Discussed using a ticketing system for alerts, as I’ve found the ways in which companies receive alerts to vary in maturity which impacts their ability to properly monitor and respond to incidents.</li>
  <li>Discussed turning on more log sources, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/log-your-vpc-dns-queries-with-route-53-resolver-query-logs/">VPC DNS queries</a>, VPC Flow Logs, S3 access logs, etc. and linked to a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdfuller">Matt Fuller</a> for a list of log sources on AWS: <a href="https://matthewdf10.medium.com/how-to-enable-logging-on-every-aws-service-in-existence-circa-2021-5b9105b87c9">How to Enable Logging on Every AWS Service in Existence (Circa 2021)</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IAM user access keys, when required, should ideally be put in a single account and assume roles into other accounts as it makes detection of compromise easier.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that Access Advisor now shows the use of s3:ListAllMyBuckets, so you should use that to remove that specific privilege when not needed.</li>
  <li>Discussed the need to plan how accounts will be connected, as the security boundaries of separate accounts can become blurred due to trust relationships of resource policies, network connections, and other mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Expanded on the discussion of using SCPs to mention how exceptions can be made for specific roles, and SCPs can vary between accounts. Therefore, you can initialize an account by configuring it’s network configuration in advance and restricting changes via SCPs, such that a dev account may be restricted from making any resources public. Also listed possible SCPs to deploy, which are described in my post <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/03/25/aws_scp_best_practices/">AWS SCP Best Practices</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/accelerate-infrastructure-as-code-development-with-open-source-former2/">former2</a> for helping transition to IaC (Infrastructure as Code).</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IaC scanning tools can be used, referencing <a href="https://twitter.com/christophetd">Christophe’s</a> post <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/shifting-cloud-security-left-scanning-infrastructure-as-code-for-security-issues/">Shifting Cloud Security Left — Scanning Infrastructure as Code for Security Issues</a>.</li>
  <li>Removed mention of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/">Tag Policies</a> as this service is limited in various ways that make it not worth bothering with.</li>
  <li>Merged “Stage 8: Enhance detection” and “Stage 9: Auto-remediation and privilege refinement” into one stage. Mostly because I wanted this to be 10 stages. :)</li>
  <li>Mentioned Client Side Monitoring as part of the least privilege improvements, and linked to the cloudonaut article <a href="https://cloudonaut.io/record-aws-api-calls-to-improve-iam-policies/">Record AWS API calls to improve IAM Policies</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/">Network Firewall</a> as a solution for monitoring and protecting your networks.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of microservices to access resources instead of direct access so that better monitoring, restrictions, and rate limiting can be performed.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Building a startup is like climbing a mountain. Except this mountain has no trails, so you can only use your best guess to reach the summit. Every startup will have a different set of peaks to climb, but planning and strategizing are important to reaching the top, no matter the specific goal.</span></p>

<p><span>In planning your 2021 goals, start by answering three questions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Where do you want to be in 12 months?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>What are the metric(s) of success?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How do you get there?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>To get the most value out of goal setting for your startup, be flexible, measure along the way, and check in on your progress at clear intervals.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Create Anti-Goals</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/1986/06/13/charlie-mungers-speech-to-the-harvard-school-june-1986" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>“Invert. Always Invert” - Charlie Munger</span></a></p>
<p><span>Startups face a hazy, treacherous path from the start. Most of the time, it can feel like we are struggling to see only a few days or weeks ahead, let alone 12 months. Because early-stage companies cannot be sure of what the coming months will look like, it can sometimes be more practical to approach goal setting by developing anti-goals.</span></p>
<p><span>By inverting the problem of long-term goal setting, your team will mark out where they </span><b><i>don’t</i></b><span> want to be and work backwards.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Some anti-goals may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Not having a product in the market by EOY</span></li>
<li><span>Not having closed any sales</span></li>
<li><span>Having fewer customers than you have today</span></li>
<li><span>Failing to raise your next round</span></li>
<li><span>Losing a key employee(s)</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Mark out clear initiatives that prevent you from ending up where you don’t want to be. It could be something like setting as many prospecting calls as possible over the first few weeks of the year. Or, maybe it's breaking down all the product features needed to get you to an MVP and entering them into your project management software. Or perhaps it's having thoughtful 1-1s each week with your key reports and getting it on the calendar today.</span></p>
<p><span>With a sense of what needs to be done, next establish a cadence and system to keep you in check.</span></p>

<p><b>1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter, 1 year.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Using time segments to establish goals forces you to be realistic. Annual revenue goals follow from quarterly revenue goals, which in turn follow from monthly prospect appointment goals. If you have a plan to increase your revenue by $2,000,000, set a quarterly revenue goal of $500,000. To achieve that quarterly goal, back into how many sales meetings will need to be set per month. Using these time-based stair-steps, create secondary checkpoint goals to evaluate success along the way to your annual goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva, has a </span><a href="https://www.33voices.com/posts/how-to-set-and-achieve-your-startup-goals" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>weekly goal setting meeting with her leadership team</span></a><span>. This helps set targets for the current week based on the goals for the&nbsp; quarter or year. Using this idea, schedule a weekly meeting with stakeholders to course correct from the previous week. Similarly, schedule a monthly review meeting to zoom out and ensure you are on target.</span></p>

<p><b>Use a Compass.</b></p>
<p><span>Travel certain trails in the Adirondacks, and you will notice colored markers nailed to trees every 200 feet. These markers help you correct course as you hike. To have the same for your startup, l</span><span>ay out the markers to success before you begin your journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To ensure success on our journey, first formalize what KPIs are tracked to evaluate success and then set recurring monthly (or weekly) meetings to review with the broader team. If you're still determining which KPIs might be right, look through some of the </span><a href="https://www.notion.so/Startup-KPIs-to-Track-bd38b695c93b444ebc1e819143c543ec" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples we put together.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At each meeting, evaluate and adjust your path. If you set a goal of 40 customer development meetings this month and blew past it, maybe it’s time to revise your year end goals upward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>As you work towards your annual goals throughout the coming year, keep in mind that </b><a href="https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><b>the map is not the territory</b></a><span>. Even the best laid plans are merely abstractions of the reality they are intended to represent. Be vigilant in constant re-evaluation of the goals set for yourself and your team. In your meetings, constantly question your assumptions to ensure you don’t look back in 12 months and ask yourself how you missed your goals by so much. Armed with this process to navigate your journey, you will be prepared to start the climb to the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Data is a valuable currency in the modern digital economy. However, it is still a challenge to keep pace with the rapid changes in enterprise data and the growing demand for information; thereby, providing the raison d’etre for the movement of data from legacy mainframe server-type infrastructures to the cloud to scale data-driven decision-making.</span></p><p><span>Experts agree that cloud-based technologies are integral to ensuring data security, management, process compliance, and privacy across the entire enterprise data spectrum. However, there is one ongoing conundrum or debate, and that is how to process data faster with particular reference to streaming data versus batch data.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Consequently, let’s open this discussion with a brief definition of, and comparison between, streaming data and batch data.</span></p><h2><b>Differences Between Streaming Data and Batch Data</b></h2><h3><span>1. Batch data</span></h3><p><span>Succinctly stated, batch data processing is the processing of large data volumes in batches or groups. This data typically consists of millions of daily records, accumulated and stored in a central location before being processed.</span></p><p><span>In other words, as explained by the</span> <a href="https://www.upsolver.com/blog/etl-process-flow-batch-etl-vs-streaming-etl"><span>Upsolver.com team</span></a><span>, batch processing is the mechanism used by users to “</span><i><span>collect and store data in batches during a batch window. This can save time and improves the efficiency of processing the data and helps organizations and companies in managing large amounts of data and processing it quickly</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Ergo, it is a highly effective method of processing sequential records collected over time in a non-stop, sequential order.</span></p><h3><span>2. Streaming data</span></h3><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The counterbalance to batch data is streaming data. It is the mechanism by which data is analyzed almost instantaneously or continuously. This analysis occurs as the data flows through the system with no time limitations on the output. It is highly effective and beneficial if the events that produce this data occur frequently and occur at short intervals.</span></p><p><span>The Upsolver.com article quoted above adds value to the “what is streaming data” discussion by stating the following.</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>Streaming allows you to stream events from any source, and it helps you make changes to the data while you’re on the run</span></i><span>.”</span></p><h2><span>The SQL WINDOW function and its advantages over traditional SQL aggregation functions</span></h2><p><span>A</span> <a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/why-should-i-learn-sql-window-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SQL WINDOW function</span></a><span> is an aggregate function that performs a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. This is similar to the traditional aggregate function where according to the Microsoft Transact SQL documentation,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>However, the SQL WINDOW function takes the basic aggregate function further in that it does not group rows into a single output row. The rows retain their separate identities. It is also worth noting that the WINDOW function and the SQL aggregation function cannot simultaneously be used in the same SQL query.</span></p><p><span>By way of expanding on this definition, let’s look at the difference between the aggregate and WINDOW function, using the following FOREX data on currency exchange rates.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><span>CurrencyPair</span></td><td><span>DateTime</span></td><td><span>Close</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.24438</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.24454</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.24455</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.24461</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.24487</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.2448</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.11633</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.11617</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.11627</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.11636</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.1163</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.1162</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span> This table contains the closing prices for the currency pairs, GBP/USD, and EUR/USD.

The SQL code is simpler and easier to maintain, and it is much simpler to assign a value to a current row from a previous or successive row. This is a faster option than creating cursors and subqueries.</span></p><p><span>However, its most important benefit is found in its fundamental difference. Ergo, the primary difference between the aggregation function and the WINDOW function is that the rows in the WINDOW function’s result set are not collapsed. This construct is beneficial as information because it displays both the aggregated information and the single rows simultaneously.</span></p><h2><span>Breaking the traditional mold: The SQL WINDOW function in stream analytics</span></h2><p><span>The SQL WINDOW function has been adopted by data streaming experts to provide similar information. It is very useful for streaming data analytics.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, the principle is more complicated. Let’s look at a step-by-step guide to creating and implementing this function on streamed data.</span></p><p><span>Note: Data stream-driven architecture produces individual records known as events. Users can subscribe to the events in a particular service and will receive the analytical information as soon as it is available. And, because every service has near-real-time access to the data streamed events, they do not have to wait for ETL processes to finish.</span></p><p><span>Because streams are by definition unbounded, creating aggregated views is challenging without introducing boundaries.</span></p><p><span>Enter windowing: a mechanism to group the streamed events based on common event attributes. As an aside, the most common characteristic used to group events into windows is time. Also, a single event might be assigned to multiple windows. For instance, the output of event counts based on overlapping windows will differ from the output of event counts based on distinct windows.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;There are four different, commonly used</span> <a href="https://dev.to/frosnerd/window-functions-in-stream-analytics-1m6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>window functions</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><span>1. The Tumbling Window</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>Each tumbling window has a fixed length and is placed consequently in a row on a time axis. Tumbling windows do not overlay each other. In other words, each event is only assigned to one window, and each window fits on the time axis one after the other.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tumbling windows are designed using one attribute: time. Consequently, each window only contains a single event, providing a robust use case for simple reporting. For instance, tumbling windows produce useful results when asked to aggregate all the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, and grouped in a 20-second tumbling window.</span></p><p><span>The SQL code is as follows.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, Count (*) AS VisitorCount
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, TumblingWindow(second, 20);
</pre><h3><span>2. The Hopping Window</span></h3><p><span>The hopping window also has a fixed length. However, it has two configuration parameters (the time s and the hop size h) instead of just one (s) as with the tumbling window. Thus, instead of moving the window forward by s, it is driven forward by h.</span></p><p><span>Actually, tumbling windows are a form of hopping windows where s = h. And the challenge is that if s &gt; h (overlapping windows) and if s &lt; h, some events might not be assigned to a window. This is a point to take note of when implementing the hopping window construct. The most common use case for hopping windows is to calculate moving averages.</span></p><p><span>Let’s reuse the example cited in the tumbling window; except, we want to see the moving average of the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, grouped in a 20-second window hopping 2 seconds.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, HoppingWindow(second, 20, 2);
</pre><h3><span>3. The Sliding Window</span></h3><p><span>Sliding windows are hopping windows, where h 0. In other words, this window does not hop by a time interval; it slides along. It moves along the time axis as the tumbling window does, but it groups together events within the window length s. In other words, the input stream is discrete, but the subsequent, aggregated stream is not. Because the data points are discrete, it is possible to implement a sliding window based on actual events rather than continuous time. The next window is constructed whenever an event enters or exits in the forward-moving sliding window.</span></p><p><span>As with hopping windows, sliding windows are used to compute moving averages. Their uniqueness is that they provide a resolution based on the event time pattern in the data stream. If the event density increases, the moving average will increase. Juxtapositionally, if no new events are entering the sliding window, the moving average stays the same.</span></p><p><span>This SQL statement is similar to the hopping window’s SQL statement.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, SlidingWindow(second, 20);</pre><h3><span>4. The Session Window</span></h3><p><span>The session window function is the only window that is not a fixed length; it is an ever-changing length. Therefore, when using this function, you must enumerate the maximum time threshold between successive events. This window can be implemented by keeping current events in a buffer and adding new events as long as they are within the session interval. …</span></p></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>About 18 months ago <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/faas-containerd-serverless-without-kubernetes/">I started a project</a> which developed directly against containerd. This presented a problem which I'd not really encountered before - <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> on my Mac were no longer enough, I needed a Linux environment.</p>
<p>To begin with I just used an old 2016 model Dell XPS which gave me everyting I needed, but when others started to contribute, they were using Macs and so we had a problem. <a href="https://multipass.run/">Multipass</a> was the answer to our woes and we were pleasantly surprised by it and wondered why more people weren't using it every day.</p>
<p>I want to tell you a bit about our experience in the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS community</a> developing <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> - a portable FaaS framework, just like OpenFaaS, but without the complexity and overheads of a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<h2 id="whatscontainerdeverdoneforus">What's containerd ever done for us?</h2>
<p>Some time ago the original version of Docker was actually written in Python, and then morphed over time into a Go re-write. The Go version was seen as monolithic by some consumers, particularly the Kubernetes community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker did many things, and at one point clustering and multi-node orchestration was even added to that list (think Docker Swarm and Docker EE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the codebase was refactored two projects emmerged: containerd and runc.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> was a tiny Go binary that had one job: run a container based upon a spec. runc was also the driver for the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">OCI specification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a>'s job was to get things ready for runc - such as pulling images and defining specs</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker then remained as a thiner layer on top of both of these tools to bring a user-friendly developer-experience, networking, high-level API and CLI.</p>
<p>Over time containerd has shifted into the lime-light and in Kubernetes 1.20, it will take over duties for running containers in Kubernetes clusters. Now not a lot changes, because containerd was always there along with runc, we just skip a few levels of indirection.</p>
<p>containerd doesn't provide networking out of the box, and that was one of the hardest challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not because it's technically complex, but there was a severe lack of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni">Container Network Initiative (CNI)</a> filled a gap for us and enabled us to build a network between our containers.</p>
<p>When you squint at faasd, you see something that looks a lot like a single-node Kubernetes cluster, using the same projects you'd find on most nodes: containerd, runc and CNI.</p>
<h2 id="whywouldyoudevelopwithcontainerd">Why would you develop with containerd?</h2>
<p>There were two main reasons for creating "faasd" - the first was that we were hearing from users that they didn't want to run an entire Kubernetes cluster just to run a handful of functions, APIS or webpages. The second was that I fancied doing some learning and low-level coding.</p>
<p>Whilst containerd has a socket available, and can be mounted or forwarded, it doesn't work as you would expect. The containerd client tries to run containers on the host it's executing on and just synchronises state with the containerd socket. I found that very confusing, but was reassured that is the way it was designed to work.</p>
<p>You can see our code which has developed into two main services shipped in a single binary.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/cmd/up.go">faasd</a> - starts all the core services for OpenFaaS: the gateway, NATS, Prometheus and our queue worker. <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml">A docker-compose file</a> is used to define versions of images, and the dependency graph for starting up services.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/tree/master/pkg/provider">faasd-provider</a> - a HTTP interface that performs invoke and CRUD for functions and secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are installed with systemd unit files, it was refreshing to lean on the host system for once, instead of using abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="theshortversion">The short-version</h3>
<p><a href="https://multipass.run/">multipass</a> is a <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> and its open source components and usage instructions are <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command.</p>
<p>Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On MacOS it is currently using hyperkit to run VMs, which is another thing we can thank Docker for building. On Windows and Linux it uses different virtualization technology, but has the same simple user-experience which means we get to write one tutorial and to be done with it. As a busy maintainer, I see that as a big win.</p>
<p>Here's how you get a VM launched with the latest version of Ubuntu Server:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Shell into the VM:</p>
<pre><code>multipass exec faasd /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>We then realised that multipass supported cloud-init, so morphed our README to the following:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt
multipass launch --cloud-init cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to the engineering manager and PM for multipass on Zoom today and they told me you can even pass the cloud-init file as a URL, so our tutorial becomes even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --cloud-init https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>From there, you have a full Linux system with a working version of containerd and Container Network Initiative (CNI) plugins running, and most importantly faasd is up and running.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli list
faas-cli store deploy figlet
faas-cli invoke figlet &lt;&lt;&lt; "faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst I've not used it yet, I'm told you can also mount folders from your base system to synchronise your GOPATH. So you could write code using VSCode and have the built-in terminal pane running "multipass exec /bin/bash" or an ssh session.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a post on <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/memory-lane-raspberry-pi-zero/">One last trip down memory lane with the Raspberry Pi Zero</a> where I tried to port faasd to a Raspberry Pi Zero. The Go build for faasd was taking so long that I gave up, opened multipass and cross-compiled it. That whole process was quicker than waiting for the poor little armv6 service to finish its work.</p>
<h3 id="multipassforkubernetes">multipass for Kubernetes</h3>
<p>You can also use multipass to run other workloads, I tried to deploy Kubernetes with microk8s, but ran into some issues with the default limits.</p>
<p>First of all: there was not enough RAM alloacted, then there was not enough disk, finally there were not enough vCPUs. After working all that out I came up with the following:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name microk8s -m 8G -c 2 -d 80G
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's not that much of a surprise that we never ran into that issue, because faasd is designed to be ridicuously lean. It even runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 which only has 1GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>multipass has been useful for us whenever we need to access a Linux VM from a Mac. It could even be used for running a Kubernetes cluster, but I would usually prefer to deploy Kubernetes in a Docker container using either <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">KinD</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d">k3d</a> for the sheer speed and efficiency of it.</p>
<p>multipass is a much leaner alternative to tooling like VirtualBox and Vagrant. The team are looking for feedback and are already planning for a way to launch custom images. Think: <code>multipass launch openfaas</code> or <code>multipass launch gitlab</code> for instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see multipass being an important part of enabling collaboration with users from all-over the world, whether they use Linux, MacOS or Windows on their desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around 20 people have contributed to faasd directly, and many more indirectly. It worked very well for us and we believe that multipass deserves more attention.</p>
<p>Go and try it out, let them know what works for you and where it can be improved for your workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users have already suggested using <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+qemu">qemu on MacOS</a>, and the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization">Virtualization.Framework</a> introduced in Big Sur could also have some impact on the future roadmap and M1 support.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://multipass.run/">multipass.run</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whataboutfaasdvsopenfaasonkubernetes">what about faasd vs. OpenFaaS on Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>faasd now fills a nice gap where Docker Swarm used to live in the OpenFaaS ecosystem. If you're working your way up to production with Kubernetes, or already have experience then you may benefit from a cluster and installing OpenFaaS to it.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to run a few functions, start small, keep costs down, then faasd may be a better fit. Managing and keeping up with Kubernetes versions can be its own challenge. So if you want to deploy code for a customer and barely give it another thought, then package faasd as a VM or cloud-init script and be done with it.</p>
<p>faasd can be run for 5-10 USD on a cloud VPS, or on your Raspberry Pi for free using <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">an inlets tunnel</a> to get it a public IP address.</p>

<p>Russia is a large market with incredible potential. This is understood by technology giants (for example, the Russian market is one of the main ones for Apple pay) and small startups from neighbouring countries.</p>



<p>If you want to enter this market and become part of a startup ecosystem, you need to understand its structure. We have collected the most important things to start this acquaintance with.</p>



<p>In 2020, 2.8 million enterprises and 6.7 individual entrepreneurs worked in Russia (a type of entrepreneurial activity in which an individual conducts commercial activity with some restrictions and tax benefits). The entire business generated $2.4 trillion in revenue in 11 months of 2020. </p>



<p>This is one of the highest percentages of entrepreneurial activity in Eastern Europe – 7.9% of the economically active population is in business.</p>



<p>Among 9.5M entrepreneurs, 450K are involved in the startup economy of the country (provide services to startups, work in a startup or plan to launch a startup in the next 6 months). Since the last survey (аugust 2019), the audience has grown by 50K members.</p>



<blockquote><p>The male/female ratio shifted towards the former. The audience of women increased slightly (by 3K), mainly due to the audience of 45+. There are almost 50K more men.</p></blockquote>



<p>The average participant in a startup ecosystem is a 35-44 year old male (23.7%). </p>



<p>More than half of the people involved in the startup ecosystem (52%) are located in Moscow. In second place – St. Petersburg (8%), both of these cities added, after the last report, by one percent.</p>



<p>In your pocket – except for a Samsung phone with a mobile operator MTS or Megafon. Also a Tinkoff or Raiffeisenbank card.</p>



<p>Political views can be said to be moderate (certainly not liberal). They enjoy reading the blog of Sobyanin (the current mayor of Moscow) and Prokhorov.</p>



<p>Read regional Russian-language blogs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vc.ru/" target="_blank">vc.ru</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sostav.ru/" target="_blank">Sostav</a>, <a href="https://www.cossa.ru/">Cossa</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbr.org/" target="_blank">HBR</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rb.ru/" target="_blank">RB</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secretmag.ru/" target="_blank">Secret Firmy</a>.</p>



<p>Many designated Internet media can easily be entered with a press release under the heading “guest post” and get the attention of the target audience.</p>



<p>They can be seen in the DO coworking spaces, Flacon and the Skolkovo Technopark. </p>



<blockquote><p>Use the data received from Panoptic Insights in order to better understand the audience of the Russian startup market. We hope that this data will help you decide whether to enter this rich market or not.</p></blockquote>

You pick up your phone to check the time or your to-do list, and the first thing you see is that you've received 9 messages from 4 different people, who are waiting for your response. Let’s start with an assessment.</p><h2>What is the state of play with notifications?</h2><h3>They capture our attention</h3><p>In 2015, researchers from Florida State University published <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.distraction" target="_blank">this study</a> on attention and phone notifications. Participants worked on an attention-demanding task on a computer, during which some received automated call or text alerts on their personal phones. As it turns out, those who received text notifications performed poorly compared to participants who didn’t. Those who received call notifications performed even worse than those who got text messages. Here’s the most interesting part: simply knowing that you have received a text or missed a call might impact your attention as much as actually using your phone. That’s because some of your focus is now allocated to remembering this notification that’s waiting for you.</p><h3>They get in our way</h3><p>Fast-forward to the 20’s. Today, push notifications may be the most obvious form of interruptions because they pop up on or slide into our screens ; but they’re not the only ones that cut off our flow. For instance, I would love to have Discord open, or to use Twitter, without having the constant reminder that I have things to catch up on. The notification badge, with or without count, disrupts our focus. If you open Twitter because you want to message someone, the badge immediately calls for your attention instead of letting you pursue the task you had in mind.</p><p>An alternative design could be one that lets you check your notifications whenever it suits you, making it a deliberate choice, by removing their constant presence on the homepage and keeping them contained to a dedicated zone. Dr. Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, and professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, uses <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids" target="_blank">this expressive comparison</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our attention is being captured by devices rather than being voluntarily regulated. We are like a sailor without a rudder on the ocean — pushed and pulled by the digital stimuli to which we are exposed rather than by the intentional direction of our own mind.”</em></p></blockquote><h3>What’s with the red?</h3><p>There’s also the issue of the colour. Many notification badges are <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-apples-notification-bubbles-are-so-stressful-65a544e51f10" target="_blank">red by default</a>. Red is the colour that stands out the most in our daily life. Whether in a city, in nature, or at home, this hue contrasts the best against any background. As a result, red is also consistently used to alert us of important signals, including in the physical world. By important, I mean “that which could have strongly negative consequences if we miss them”. The stop sign, the red light, the no-crossing light, the stove, the train’s emergency window breaker, the car dashboard’s red lights, and more, use red as a signifier.</p><p>So not only is red more striking, but we’re also conditioned to be particularly attentive to red signals. Now, I ask you: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red? I’m curious where your mind is at. I created a poll on Twitter, and you can vote below or <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937">over there</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.<br><br>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you\u2019re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p>\u2014 This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610456282977_18734"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.</p><p>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p></div>— This Too Shall Grow 🌱 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

We’re constantly being summoned: we switch between tasks and different platforms without dedicating appropriate levels of attention to each. In the example I mentioned above, you 1) open twitter.com, but before completing the “send message to friend” task, you 2) are prompted by the notification badge. So you 3) open the notifications panel, switching to a “read notifications” task. Some of them require a reaction from you, where you 4) switch to “post reply” or “like tweet”. Once you’re done going through this list, you 5) can finally return to your original messaging task.</p><p>“I have strong willpower, I would stick to the original task without checking my notifications”, you say? That’s great! Though as we’ve seen above, the niggling awareness of new information waiting for you is enough to impede your focus.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_15957"><div>

Take emails: a promotional newsletter from The Fork, or the LinkedIn announcement that someone you don’t know started a new job, are given the same importance as an email from your client saying they accepted your budget. Gmail tabs and inbox filters can help with that, but most email providers don’t have that kind of feature enabled by default. John Herrman, tech and media reporter, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html" target="_blank">eloquently written</a> about this topic:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I’ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while</em>.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“<em>The same badge might lead to word that Grandma’s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don’t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat. New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Here are some examples of irrelevant notifications:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Other people - whom I don’t know - commented on a post I’ve commented on</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_22192"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_30798"><div><p>Those are what Adrian Zumbrunnen calls “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-rise-of-anti-notifications-6c92e355612b" target="_blank">anti-notifications</a>”: notifications that aren’t about you or meant for you, but are instead about others. None of the screenshots above concern me, yet LinkedIn decided on my behalf that having them in my feed wasn’t enough, but that I should also be notified of them.</p><h2>How are mindful notifications helpful?</h2><p>What are mindful notifications? Here’s my attempt at constructing a definition.</p><p>“Notifications are mindful when their mental cost and attention required are suitable to the information communicated to a given user. It enables them instead of hindering them. As much as possible, it’s signalling instead of interrupting.”</p><p>I asked people in the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank">Ness Labs community</a> to tell me about their relationship with notifications. Here’s what they shared:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I've turned most notifications off, entirely, especially sounds but also quite a few badges. This has increased my productivity and my equanimity. I find myself no less informed as a result. I am experimenting with widgets on my iPhone to surface the information I want convenient access to” - </em><a href="https://twitter.com/manleywalker" target="_blank">Manley</a></p></blockquote><p>I also found <a href="https://twitter.com/_middlesister" target="_blank">Karin</a>’s approach interesting. She has a feature phone for personal use, and a smartphone for her professional life only. On her smartphone, everything is off by default - including badges and sound - and she only allows a few selected apps to notify her. This mindset of starting with a clean slate and only turning on the relevant alerts helps ensure that she makes her digital life work for her, and not the other way around.</p><p>Another member mentioned she has no social media, and that she keeps her phone free from work emails and news apps.

<p>A few weeks ago, Chip compared the state of real-time machine learning in China and US: While many Chinese companies have adopted real-time ML, US companies are still assessing its value. She also wrote about ML going real-time <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Talking to Internet companies in China gives me the impression that their MLOps infra is away ahead.</p><p>Many US Internet co. are still wondering if there's value in real-time ML. Chinese counterparts are already doing real-time inference + online training.</p><p>Are my samples biased?</p></div>— Chip Huyen (@chipro) <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1337077324936663040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>This post continues the thread and shares <strong>how real-time ML looks in practice</strong>. Drawing from my experience and industry papers/blogs, weâ€™ll discuss <strong>real-time recommendations</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When does real-time recommendation make sense? When does it not?</li>
<li>How have China and US companies implemented real-time recommenders?</li>
<li>How can we design and implement a simple MVP?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This discussion assumes basic knowledge of recommendation systems, such as the difference between item-to-item and user-to-item, and the candidate generation &amp; ranking paradigm. Fret not if those terms are unfamiliar. Weâ€™ll have two primers to help you get up to speed. Click on the ðŸ‘‰ below to start with the first.</p>
<details><summary id="primer-i">Primer I: Collaboration vs. Content-based, item-to-item vs. user-to-item</summary>
<div>
<p>If you understand the difference between collaboration vs. content-based recommendations, and item-to-item vs. user-to-item, feel free to skip this section.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration-based recommendations are based on user behavior</strong>. Assume I like movie <code><span>X</span></code> and dislike movie <code><span>Y</span></code>. To recommend movies to me, we first find users similar to me (i.e., like <code><span>X</span></code>, dislike <code><span>Y</span></code>). Then, from those users, what are movies they liked, but Iâ€™ve not watched? Those movies are then recommended to me. With user behavioral data, users can â€œcollaborateâ€� to create recommendations for each other. Collaborative filtering is probably the most well-known approach.</p>
<p><strong>Content-based recommendations are based on item metadata</strong>. Given the movies Iâ€™ve watched (and enjoyed), content-based recommenders suggest movies of similar genre, time period, director, etc. Relative to collaboration-based recommenders, content-based recommenders tend to be more effective when the movie is new and we donâ€™t have enough user behavioral data about it yet (i.e., cold-start problem)</p>
<p><strong>In item-to-item (i2i) recommendations, given an item, we recommend other items</strong>. Hereâ€™s an example of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/" target="_blank">i2i recommendations on IMDB</a>, under the â€œMore Like Thisâ€� widget. This works well in scenarios where the focus is the item (e.g., item detail page).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mlt.jpg" loading="lazy" title="More like Independence Day on IMDB" alt="More like Independence Day on IMDB"></p><p>More like Independence Day on IMDB</p>
<p><strong>In user-to-item (u2i), given a user, we recommend items</strong>. We see this on the home page of Netflix, Amazon, Taobao, sometimes with the name of â€œRecommended For Youâ€�. Our social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) are u2i recommendations too. In such scenarios, the user (and their historical preferences) is the focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/rfy.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Recommended For You on Amazon" alt="Recommended For You on Amazon"></p><p>Recommended For You on Amazon</p>
<p>Taken together, i2i and u2i recommendations provide coverage for the bulk of user traffic via detail pages and home pages.</p>
</div>
</details>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use-real-time-recommendations">When <em>(not)</em> to use real-time recommendations?</h2>
<p>Before we get too excited, let me first say that <strong>most use cases wonâ€™t need real-time recommendations</strong>; batch recommendations are good enough.</p>
<p>Relative to real-time recommendations, batch recommendations are computationally cheaper. They are usually generated once a day and benefit from batch processingâ€™s economies of scale. The recommendations are then loaded into a key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) and served via a key-value lookup.</p>
<p>Batch recommendations are also simpler ops-wise. By caching pre-computed recommendations (in our key-value store), we decouple computation from serving. Thus, even if the compute step fails, thereâ€™s no customer-facing impact; we continue to serve the previous batch of (slightly stale) recommendations. The cache provides a buffer and ensures almost 100% uptime, reducing ops burden on the team (e.g., on-call, complaints).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/batch-vs-stream.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics" alt="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics"></p>
<p>Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics (<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/09/converged-data-platform-unifying-streaming-data-using-mapr/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In contrast, real-time recommendations usually require more computation. For example, we might aggregate streamed events (e.g., click, like, purchase) and generate new recommendations on-demand, based on user interactions. (In comparison, batch recommendations only compute a single set daily.) Furthermore, such computation is done individually and does not benefit from economies of scale. (Nonetheless, we save on not generating recommendations for customers who donâ€™t visit our app).</p>
<p>Operating real-time recommendations in production is also far tricker. Instead of using ephemeral Spark clusters (for compute) and a DynamoDB (for serving), weâ€™ll need low-latency high-throughput APIs with 24/7 uptime. In the strictest scenario, we wonâ€™t have our key-value store as a buffer. The line between compute and serving disappears. Ops burden will increase (read: weâ€™ll be paged in the middle of the night for an outage in another timezone ðŸš¨).</p>
<p><strong>Why real-time recommendations then?</strong> Theyâ€™re useful when the customer journey is mission-centric and depends on the context. Such missions are often time-sensitive. Real-time demand fades quickly; demand could be met (on a competitor site) or the user might lose interest. Weâ€™ll examine this in two examples: shopping and watching a movie.</p>
<p>Shopping is a <strong>mission-centric activity</strong>. Though a customer might predominately purchase a category of products, their shopping behavior is often punctuated with tangential missions. For example, if I usually shop for clothes, my u2i recommendations will mostly be fashion recommendations. However, if I need a new wide-screen monitor and start browsing for one, my u2i recommendations should update ASAP to help me quickly fulfill my mission (lest I go to a competing app).</p>
<p>In this scenario, batch recommendations donâ€™t react fast enough. And even when the recommendations are updated, due to the data imbalance, such mission-related needs are not met (More in Section 2.1 of this <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240323.3240372" target="_blank">Netflix paper</a>).</p>
<p>The movies we watch <strong>depend on context</strong> (though our long-term preferences are fairly stable). For example, we might watch different movies depending on whether weâ€™re alone, with friends, with a romantic interest, or with children. It might also depend on our mood, as well as the time of day. Similar to shopping, daily batch recommendations face the same challenges here.</p>
<p>Other than the examples above, real-time recommendations are also handy in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel (our vacation destinations are often changing)</li>
<li>YouTube (we watch videos for coding, yoga, and recipes within the same day)</li>
<li>Serving ads (our interest is time-sensitive; our attention spans are shrinking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-time recommendations are also useful when the majority of our customers are new (i.e., cold-start). This happens when weâ€™re in the customer acquisition stage, such as when weâ€™ve just launched a new product or entered a new market (e.g., e-commerce in Southeast Asia in 2013 - 2015).</p>
<p>Imagine youâ€™ve just downloaded an e-commerce app. Since weâ€™re uncertain of your gender, the home page will have a mix of categories catering to each gender, from dresses to menâ€™s shirts, from GPUs to makeup. If you click on a dress, we can immediately build a persona (that youâ€™re female) and personalize your shopping experience. In this case, the u2i recommendations on your home page will tilt towards female products.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/" target="_blank">1 in 4 users abandon mobile apps</a> <em>after only one use</em>, quickly responding to customer needsâ€”from the very first touchpointâ€”helps with acquisition and retention.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Most modern recommenders have two key components: candidate generation and ranking.</p>
<p>Candidate generation is a fastâ€”but coarseâ€”approach to get (hundreds of) item candidates from millions of items. We trade off precision for efficiency to reduce the search space (e.g., from 100 million to 1,000 candidates, a 99.999% reduction). This is usually done via metadata-based filters (e.g., category, brand) or k-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>Ranking is a slowerâ€”but more preciseâ€”approach to sort and select top recommendation candidates. We have leeway to include features that might not have been feasible in the candidate generation step. Such features include user persona (e.g., demographics, price propensity), item metadata (e.g., attributes, engagement statistics), cross features (e.g., interaction between each feature pair), and media embeddings.</p>
<p>Ranking can be framed as either a classification or learning to rank problem. As a classification problem, we can score candidates based on probability of click or purchase. Logistic regression with crossed features is simple to implement and a difficult baseline to beat. Decision trees are also commonly used. As a learning to rank problem, commonly used algorithms include <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ranking-boosting-and-model-adaptation/" target="_blank">LambdaMart</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Abstract.html" target="_blank">LightGBM</a>. Neural networks are also gaining adoption, thanks to <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/notes-from-sparkai-summit-application-agnostic/#scaling-up-deep-learning-by-scaling-down-24th-june" target="_blank">gains in model efficiency</a> via distillation, pruning, quantization, etc.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/xwd18280820053/article/details/90316416" target="_blank">general reference</a> sheds light on recommendation systems from a Chinese perspective. Itâ€™s organized based on the paradigm discussed, with sections for candidate generation (â€œMatchâ€�) and ranking (â€œRankâ€�). It also discusses two other components: profile (building user preferences) and post-processing (e.g., excluding previously purchased goods, item-deduplication across recommendation sets).</p>
<p><strong>To see how recommendations can be incrementally updated</strong>, weâ€™ll discuss two algorithms: the humble collaborative filtering (CF) and Alibabaâ€™s Swing algorithm that improves on CF.</p>

<p>Developers and software teams already know that one of the biggest challenges of their job is <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/how-to-scope-software-projects">accurately scoping work</a>, and being able to consistently and predictably deliver results to clients within the promised timeline.</p>



<p>Yet another challenge is finding ways to streamline workflows so <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">missed deadlines due to inaccurate scoping</a> become 100 percent a thing of the past. Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are just a few metrics that software teams can track and optimize to boost their efficiency and productivity —&nbsp;but these are also metrics that are often confused with one another.</p>



<p>Each one of them —&nbsp;lead time, cycle time, and takt time — is an individual metric that helps developers monitor, track, and evaluate <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">how efficiently your team completes projects</a>. Optimizing each of them for better efficiency doesn’t only boost client satisfaction; it also makes your team better, faster, and stronger.</p>







<p>But doing that requires understanding what each metric is, how to calculate it, and the role it plays in the overall project scope. By understanding the differences between lead time, cycle time, and takt time — and how and when to use each metric —&nbsp;developers can discover paths to better scoping and increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Lead Time vs Cycle Time vs Takt Time: What Are They</h2>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time all come from Kanban, a workflow management method that was originally created to help streamline manufacturing processes. Many of the principles of Kanban translate well to the process of software development, so it’s become a common practice for managing workflows for software teams, as well.</p>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are all metrics used to track, measure, and evaluate efficiency at different parts of the production process. If that doesn’t make sense just yet, don’t worry —&nbsp;we’ll explain each one in better detail down below.</p>



<h3>What Is Lead Time?</h3>



<p>Lead time is the total amount of time between when a new task or project enters your workflow, and when it leaves your workflow. In other words, it’s the total time from when your team agrees to take on a project, to when you deliver it to the client.</p>



<h4>How Is Lead Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for lead time in a manufacturing setting is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Lead Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In the context of a software team, that might look like this:</p>



<ul><li>After the client makes a request that includes three deliverables, it takes your team two days to process it.</li><li>Then, it takes four months (~120 days) to complete the project.</li><li>Once the project is finished on your end, the client takes two weeks (14 days) to review it and make the final payment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>In this case, the lead time would equal 2 days + 120 days + 14 days, or 136 days.</strong></p>



<h4>Why Is Lead Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Lead time provides you with a good overview of how long a project takes from start to finish. You can compare your lead time to your cycle time to determine some insights about your team’s productivity and customer satisfaction, but more on that in a minute.</p>



<h3>What Is Cycle Time?</h3>



<p>Cycle time is how you can measure how long it takes your team to complete work on a project. In manufacturing, cycle time means the amount of time it takes to complete a production cycle from beginning to end. For software teams, that usually translates to the amount of time from when your team starts coding, to when the software is released.</p>



<p>Cycle time differs from lead time in that it measures <em>only</em> the time your team spends in production. Lead time takes that measurement, then combines it with the time it takes your team to receive and process requests, deliver them to the client, and receive approval and payment.</p>



<h4>How Is Cycle Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating cycle time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Cycle Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s take the same example from above, and calculate the team’s cycle time.</p>



<p>It took the team 120 hours to complete the three deliverables the client requested. So cycle time could be calculated in two different ways.</p>



<ul><li>120 hours divided by three deliverables = 40 hours of cycle time per deliverable; or</li><li>120 hours divided by one project for the client = 120 hours of cycle time</li></ul>



<h4>Why Is Cycle Time Important for Software teams?</h4>



<p>Cycle time is one of the most important metrics you can compare to your lead time, and how those two differ can tell you quite a bit about your team’s efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, if your cycle time is much lower than your lead time, it shows that your team is either taking a long time to process requests and begin projects, or projects are lingering in the approval phase. This could mean your team is leaving loose ends and not moving through the entire workflow efficiently.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your cycle time is equal to your lead time, it could be because you’re allowing processing and approval times on projects to overlap. While this might be an efficient use of your software team’s time, it may also lower the quality of the customer service you deliver.</p>



<h3>What Is Takt Time?</h3>



<p>And now, let’s look at time measurements from a different angle with takt time. Takt time is a measurement of how quickly or efficiently your team is able to meet the needs of your client or production schedule. “Takt” comes from the German word for “pulse,” and that’s a good way of looking at it —&nbsp;this measurement finds your team’s ideal “pulse” of work, that allows you to deliver projects as needed without underworking or overworking the team.</p>



<h4>How Is Takt Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating takt time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Takt Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This can be a little trickier to apply to work like software development (though that doesn’t make it a less useful metric!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the example we’ve been using above, we can take those three deliverables the client needs, and divide them into the 120 hours your team has available for the project. In that case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 3 = 40 hours per deliverable.</p>



<p>But we know software development isn’t always that easy to segment. So, to look at this another way, let’s say your team has scoped the client’s project and determined there are 6 smaller goals you need to achieve during your sprints. So in this case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 6 = 20 hours per sprint. That means your team can plan on completing two sprints per week to hit their optimal pulse, or takt, for this project.</p>



<h4>Why Is Takt Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Takt time tells you whether your team is overworked and unable to keep up with demand, or underworked and not being as productive as it could be.</p>



<p>For example, if you calculate your takt time to be 120 hours per project, but your team’s cycle time is 150 hours, your team won’t be able to deliver on the deadlines it’s scoping.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your takt time is 120 hours and your cycle time is 100 hours, you’re leaving 20 hours per project in your scope as wasted time.</p>



<h2>How Can You Measure Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Takt Time?</h2>



<p>We know time tracking <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">isn’t a favorite topic among developers</a>. But for getting the valuable insights that lead time, cycle time, and takt time can provide, it’s 100 percent necessary.</p>



<p>So why not use a time tracking tool that’s built into your existing systems, but stays in the background, out of your way while you do the job you’re here to do? <a href="https://www.7pace.com/">7pace Timetracker</a> is just that — it’s a time tracking tool built for developers, by developers who use it themselves. It integrates directly into Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">GitHub</a>, so no matter where and how you work, it’s always where you need it to be —&nbsp;tracking time so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>But we know we’re not going to sell you on a time tracking tool unless there’s real value your team can gain. That’s why it’s not so important <em>how</em> you track different time metrics —&nbsp;what matters is <em>why</em> you track them (and how you use the insights they give you).</p>



<h3>Why Should You Track All These Time Metrics?</h3>



<p>Tracking time metrics like lead time, cycle time, and takt time comes with a whole pile of potential benefits for your team. These metrics can:</p>



<ul><li>Help your team identify bottlenecks in your workflow;</li><li>Give you a better understanding of your team’s capacity for work;</li><li>Help you more accurately scope new projects.</li></ul>



<p>The most important takeaway here is that tracking different time metrics gives you a complete view of how your team is spending time. That allows you to identify any workflow problems, and identifying them is the first step toward eliminating them — and getting as close as possible to maximum productivity with your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note and recognize that time metrics will be constantly changing, so this isn’t a one-and-done kind of assessment. In order to keep getting the maximum value out of tracking time metrics, you’ll have to continue to track and analyze them over time, on all your projects —&nbsp;and adjust your workflow accordingly. Sometimes changes you put into place based on one set of time metrics will end up getting reversed later based on a newer set of time metrics — software teams are made up of people, after all, and not robots.</p>



<p>It takes some time and effort to constantly track time metrics, but we think the value of the insights you can gather makes the endeavor well worth it. If you’re ready to start tracking your team’s time metrics —&nbsp;from lead time to cycle time to takt time and even more — you need the time tracker that will automate the most tedious parts of the process.

<p>
From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

The main US military and intelligence computer networks are (of course) only accessible for authorized personnel from the United States. Special security measures are in place to prevent interception by foreign intelligence agencies. Most of the tools and programs used by NSA run on JWICS and NSANet, but here we only mention them when this is confirmed by  documents. </p><blockquote>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

</p>
<p>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

Finally, there's the <b>Capitol Network</b> (CapNet, formerly known as Intelink-P), which provides Congressional intelligence consumers with connectivity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelink" target="_blank">Intelink-TS</a> and <a href="http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/CIASource" target="_blank">CIASource</a>, the latter being the CIA's primary dissemination vehicle for both finished and unfinished intelligence reports.</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h488Ajw2pV8/VrA6r26xQsI/AAAAAAAAC_s/ZqEaJoXWiCw/s1600/homeland-security-networks.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h488Ajw2pV8/VrA6r26xQsI/AAAAAAAAC_s/ZqEaJoXWiCw/s1600/homeland-security-networks.jpg" title="Major US Homeland Security computer networks" width="450"></a><br>

Besides the aforementioned networks that are only accessible for authorized military and intelligence personnel from the United States, there are also computer networks set up by the US for multinational coalitions, and which therefore can also be used by officials from partner countries. </p><p>

The group of countries that have access to such coalition networks is often denoted by a number of "Eyes" corresponding with the number of countries that participate.</p>

    <p><img src="https://techaid24.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Switch-Case-In-Python.jpg" alt="Python Switch Case"></p>

<p>The <em>switch</em> is a statement that evaluates the accuracy or similarity of the value of a certain input.
But isn’t that the same thing that the <em>if</em> statement does?
Let’s see this statement starting with <strong>bash</strong> scripting language.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>case</span> EXPRESSION in

  PATTERN_1<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_2<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_N<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  *<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em>EXPRESSION</em> is an expression (command) or a variable. <em>PATTERN_N</em>, is a value that is expected from <em>EXPRESSION</em>. <em>*</em> is default value.</p>
<p>So given an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, I evaluate the <strong>PATTERN</strong> cases and if they don’t fit into the latter, the default <strong>*</strong> comes into play. Simple. Let’s see her at work.</p>
<h2 id="switch-work">Switch, work!</h2>
<p>Which fruit do you want?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> -n <span>"Enter the name of a fruit "</span>
<span>read</span> FRUIT

<span>echo</span> -n <span>"The </span><span>$FRUIT</span><span> is "</span>

<span>case</span> <span>$FRUIT</span> in

  apple<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"apple"</span>
    <span>;;</span>

  banana<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"banana"</span>
    <span>;;</span>

    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In bash everything is very simple and clear. Let’s see what happens in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="switch-in-other-languages">Switch in other languages</h2>
<p>In other languages such as Java and .NET C#, the switch case is a bit more complicated. However, compared to the simplicity of the bash case, the purpose is clear.

<h2 id="but-in-python">But in python?</h2>
<p>Python does not have any <em>switch</em> statements.
A <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/">PEP 3103</a> has been evaluated and created, but the conclusion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was reflecting above, the switch case is very similar to the if statement.
An early form of switch in python could be given by <strong>if/elif/else</strong> statements.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>fruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>

<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is simple to both read and understand. But it’s still not a switch statement. The switch evaluates the accuracy but also the similarity of a word.
There is an object in python which acts as a selector. Not for nothing have the two classes written in Java and C# above called “<em>Selector</em>”.</p>
<p>A selector evaluates an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, takes its value and checks the accuracy of the <strong>PATTERN</strong>, otherwise, it returns a default value (<strong>*</strong>).
The dictionary object is a kind of selector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being based on hash indexes, it is much faster in retrieving values. Let’s try to create our selector.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>myfruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>
<span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blueberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>myfruit</span><span>,</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this way, we made our switch selector, beautiful and “<em>pythonic</em>”. But still, the exactness but also the similarity of a word is not evaluated.</p>
<h2 id="can-it-be-improved">Can it be improved?</h2>
<p>Yes, of course!
Let’s now create a function that will act as a selector, as we’ve seen done in Java and C#.
There is a python builtin that applies filters. The function is called <em>filter</em>. Apply a function to an iterable. Functions such as terables are python objects and can be assigned as arguments to other functions. Also, our fruit selector (dictionary) is an iterable. We just need a function that evaluates the similarity of the keys.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>fruit</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>in</span> <span>key</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()))</span>

<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'banana'</span><span>)</span>
<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'anana'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In python, methods of classes and functions are objects of type <em>Callable</em>. Being objects, information can be stored in them.
We will transform our selector into a switch, with an added value: the cache of the last selected fruit.
In python everything is an object and therefore can be treated as such.
If we wanted to abstract our selector even more to make it become a switch in effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="a-callable-switch">A callable switch</h2>
<p>Also, since functions in python are objects, it is possible to replace string values of the dictionary with functions and return them if the keys match, in this way, can be called. A very simple example.
In effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In fact, <strong>python</strong> doesn’t need a switch statement. Do other programming languages really need it? I believe that in simple languages like <strong>bash</strong>, there is a real need for this construct. In <strong>Java</strong> you could do the same thing I did in python via a map object and same thing in <strong>C#</strong>. Finally, I agree with the conclusions of PEP 3103: <em>“In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right."</em></p>

            </small></p><p><a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/">Ohm</a> is an open-source parsing toolkit for JavaScript which <a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/">Alex Warth</a> and I have been working on since 2014. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.</p>
<p>This article is not about Ohm itself, but about the <strong>Ohm visualizer</strong>, which I designed and built in 2015 while working on Alex’s team at CDG.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Later, the team expanded the visualizer into the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">Ohm Editor</a>, which we continued to actively develop over the years. The editor itself has been <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/live2016/">presented before</a>, so I’ll focus specifically on the visualization here.</p>
<p>Creating the visualization was one of the most difficult and interesting design challenges I’ve ever tackled — so it’s been rewarding to hear from people who have found it to be helpful:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey, I used Ohm for the first time a couple days ago.</p><p>I used to have an irrational fear of writing parsers.</p><p>Your visualization cured it.<br>Thanks a lot!</p></div>— Anselm Eickhoff (@ae_play) <a href="https://twitter.com/ae_play/status/1347325515770826757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></blockquote>


<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Ohm is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">parsing expression grammars</a> (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. Like other PEG-based tools, it uses <em>packrat parsing</em>, a form of top-down parsing with unlimited lookahead.</p>
<p>One of Ohm’s main goals is ease-of-use —&nbsp;not only for the end users of languages, but also for grammar authors. And debugging grammars can be a notoriously painful. So I designed and built an interactive visualization that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. This lets grammar authors <em>follow the flow</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> rather than “playing computer” and trying to simulate the execution in their head.</p>
<p>When creating or debugging a grammar, there are a few things you might be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parse succeeded…<ul>
<li>…what does the parse tree look like?</li>
<li>Did it parse the input the way I intended? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the parse failed, why did it fail?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, I explored two different design directions: one focused on the output (the parse tree), and another that focused on the algorithm execution. The big challenge was to come up with a design that could do both.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out all the examples here online in the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/">Ohm Editor</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Visualizing Parse Trees</h2>
<p>To visualize the parse tree, I chose a variant of the icicle plot (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685881?seq=1">Kruskal and Landwehr 1983</a>). Some people may be more familiar with the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> used in software profilers, which are basically inverted icicle plots.</p>
<p>Each node is represented by a <span>gray rectangle</span>, with its children directly below it. A <span>dashed bottom border</span> indicates a node with hidden children. You can click on a node to show or hide its children.</p>
<p>Unlike most icicle plots, the absolute width of a box is not meaningful — only its width and position relative to the input text. Nodes always sit directly below the input text they consumed.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This is emphasized by highlighting the relevant portion of the input when the cursor is over the node:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/arithmetic-parse-tree-hover.png" width="320px"></p>
<p>This means that the node must be at least as wide as its consumed input. We also ensure that the nodes are always wide enough to display the full label. So unlike most hierarchicial visualizations, there’s no need to hover over a node to see its label.</p>
<p>To satisfy both of these width constraints, the layout algorithm will expand the letter spacing of the input text where required:</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<h2>Visualizing the parser execution</h2>
<p>A parse tree visualization can help you understand what the parse tree looks like, but only if the parse succeeded. If the input failed to parse, or if the parse tree is not what you intended, you’ll want to understand <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, I designed the “explain parse” feature, which shows a visual explanation of the parser’s execution. This can be enabled via the option panel in the lower right corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-checkbox.png"></p>
<p>Like other PEG-based tools, Ohm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent parsing</a>. A useful property of recursive-descent parsing is that parser’s execution (e.g. as represented by a dynamic call graph) has a very similar structure to the parse tree. This made it possible to design a single visualization that serves both purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple grammar for parsing credit card expiry dates. The animation below shows a trace of the logical steps taken to parse the input “08/24”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-expiry.gif">
<figcaption>Stepping through the parse of “08/24”.<br><i>(click to replay)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see that the tree is built in a top-down, left-to-right manner. Each non-leaf node is visited twice: once on the way down, and again on the way up. This is the basic structure of recursive-descent parsing. </p>
<p>In this extremely simple example, every step taken by the parser succeeds. So the execution trace looks <em>exactly</em> like the parse tree. This is not usually the case. Let’s take a look at a more complex example:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>In this example, several steps in the parsing failed to match any input (shown with <span>red labels</span>). This doesn’t mean something went wrong — this is just part of the way that a packrat parser works. The screenshot above shows two different types of match failure that can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failed branches of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#alternation">alternation expression</a>, as seen under <code>idFirst</code>. The parser first attempts to match an underscore (<code>"_"</code>), which fails, before successfully matching <code>letter</code> on the second branch.</li>
<li>The last child of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#repetition-operators---">repetition expression</a>. The repetition expression <code>idRest*</code> means  to match <code>idRest</code> as many times as possible; the last attempt will always fail by definition.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/highlighted-failures.png"></p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>Another challenge in designing the visualization was how to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>. In a packrat parser, backtracking happens when a successful match is part of a larger expression which fails.</p>
<p>For example, many programming languages contain <em>keywords</em> (e.g. <code>function</code>) which can appear in the same position as a variable name. A common way to handle this is to use <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#negative-lookahead-"><em>negative lookahead</em></a> to prevent incorrectly matching a keyword at the beginning of an identifier like “functional”.</p>
<p>Here is the same grammar from before, modified to include a <em>functionKeyword</em> rule. And here is the visual explanation of matching the the input “functional”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/functional-parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>The nodes with a <span>pink background</span> are nodes which successfully matched some portion of the input, but were ultimately discarded during backtracking.</p>
<h3>Left recursion</h3>
<p>One thing in Ohm that’s different from many similar tools is its special support for <em>left recursion</em>. The <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">arithmetic grammar</a> included in the Ohm Editor has some examples of left-recursive rules:</p>
<pre><code>  AddExp
    = AddExp "+" MulExp  -- plus
    | AddExp "-" MulExp  -- minus
    | MulExp
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the first two branches of <em>AddExp</em> begin with a recursive application of <em>AddExp</em> itself — that’s left recursion. In a typical recursive-descent parser, this would result in infinite recursion. However, since it’s so convenient to define left-associative operators this way, the Ohm parsing algorithm detects these rules and handles them specially.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Ohm handles left recursion by iteratively trying to expand the input consumed by the left-recursive rule, and stopping when it can’t be expanded any further. As a grammar author, you might sometimes wonder why it stopped when it did. To find out, you can look at the special <span>[Grow LR]</span> node that appears as the last child of any left-recursive rule application:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/grow-left-recursion.png"></p>
<h2>Single-stepping</h2>
<p>One other feature of the visual parse explanation is the ability to single-step through the parser’s execution. In terms of information content, it doesn’t show anything that’s not already visible in the full visualization — so in a sense, it’s not strictly necessary. However, I hoped that it might help new users learn how the visualization works.</p>
<p>Single-stepping can be controlled through the buttons in the option panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-controls.png"></p>
<p>You can also right-click on any node and choose “step into” or “step out”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-into.png"></p>
<p>From there, you can use the arrow keys to step forwards (→) or backwards (←) through the logical steps of the parser execution:</p>

</figure>



<p>As I explained at the beginning, my goal with the Ohm visualizer was <strong>to make entire execution of the parser visible and tangible</strong>. In the end, I think I was able to achieve that — but I’m sure there are also many aspects of the design that could be improved. If you have ideas, please feel free to get in touch!</p>

        <hr id="70bf0a0b-e2be-4205-ab11-7380136e2a36">
        
        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>
        
        <p id="a546e1c2-8a2d-4d3a-8d6b-0e74b0f867f0">Databases are filing cabinets.</p>
        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

        <p id="aef2d2df-d75a-43cf-a023-943585a6f450">Dictionaries, calendars, and filing cabinets are particularly useful because they represent information in a sorted order, making it possible for us to retrieve information quickly and efficiently using a process called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>. Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019
...
August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10
11
2
3
...
9

// Numerical sort
1
2
3
...
9
10
11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.
01
02
03
...
09
10
11
12</code></pre>
        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10
...
2019-12-28
...
2020-08-26
...</code></pre>
        
        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DarkMarket, the world's largest illegal marketplace on the dark web, has been taken offline in an international operation involving Germany, Australia, Denmark, Moldova, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (the National Crime Agency), and the USA (DEA, FBI, and IRS). Europol supported the takedown with specialist operational analysis and coordinated the cross-border collaborative effort of the countries involved.</p>
<h3>DarkMarket in figures:</h3>
<ul><li>almost <strong>500 000 users</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>2 400 sellers</strong>;&nbsp;</li>
<li>over <strong>320 000 transactions</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>4 650 bitcoin</strong> and <strong>12 800 monero transferred</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the current rate, this corresponds to a sum of more than <strong>€140 million</strong>. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.</p>
<h3>Germany takes the lead</h3>
<p>The Central Criminal Investigation Department in the German city of Oldenburg arrested an Australian citizen who is the alleged operator of DarkMarket near the German-Danish border over the weekend. The investigation, which was led by the cybercrime unit of the Koblenz Public Prosecutor's Office, allowed officers to locate and close the marketplace, switch off the servers and seize the criminal infrastructure – more than 20 servers in Moldova and Ukraine supported by the German Federal Criminal Police office (BKA). The stored data will give investigators new leads to further investigate moderators, sellers, and buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Europol's involvement</h3>
<ul><li>Facilitated international information exchange.</li>
<li>Provided specialist operational support.</li>
<li>Provided advanced analytics that assisted the German authorities in identifying and tracking down the alleged administrator.</li>
<li>Supported Germany in coordinating the cross-border collaborative effort involving international partners.</li>
</ul><h3>Europol's Dark Web Team</h3>
<div><p>One of Europol's initiatives is to create a coordinated law enforcement approach to tackle crime on the dark web. This involves law enforcement agencies from across and outside the EU and other relevant partners and organisations, such as Eurojust.</p><p>
&nbsp;
To achieve this goal, Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a> has established a dedicated Dark Web Team to work together with EU partners and law enforcement across the globe to reduce the size of this underground illegal economy.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>It will deliver a complete, coordinated approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>sharing information;</li>
<li>providing operational support and expertise in different crime areas;</li>
<li>developing tools, tactics and techniques to conduct dark web investigations;</li>
<li>identifying threats and targets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The team also aims to enhance joint technical and investigative actions, organise training and capacity-building initiatives, together with prevention and awareness-raising campaigns – a 360° strategy against criminality on the dark web.</p>
<p>A shared commitment across the law enforcement community worldwide and a coordinated approach by law enforcement agencies have once again proved their effectiveness. The scale of the operation at Europol demonstrates the global commitment to tackling the use of the dark web as a means to commit crime.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Despite your expectations I’m going to support that cheesy header with a real
talk! Fraudsters will hate you.</p>
<p>We have this site with classified ads in Ukraine, <a href="https://vsevolod.net/antifraud/olx.ua">OLX</a> and it is
completely plagued with spam and fraud. I create an ad to sell something I don’t
need anymore, and within a couple of hours I have some stupid fraud in my
inbox. What baffles me is that it’s very easy and simple to fix, and they do
nothing.</p>
<p>Back in 2006 I was involved in one of the forks of an open source project
<a href="https://www.l2jserver.com/">L2J</a> (so-called “server emulator”), which was a
re-creation of the server part of then-popular game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_II">Lineage
II</a> of MMORPG genre.</p>
<p>A lot of the servers were plagued with bots (official servers too). There were
two variants for the bot software — a standalone one that communicated with a
server on its own, and another one that controlled an interface of an actual
client (in-game bot).</p>
<p>In-game bot required much more resources to run (basically, a separate computer
per bot), so the majority of the problems were created by standalones, you could
easily run ten of them from a regular computer.</p>
<p>We discussed this problem in a developer chat and had an idea — maybe these
standalone bots have some differences while talking to the server? We tried to
investigate that and indeed, the order of packets was completely different
between a standalone bot and a regular game client.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to detect and reject bots on connect, but then it would
be too obvious. So we started detecting them on connect, and disconnecting and
banning after some random time online, like 2..5 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, generally bot developers aimed at official servers and couldn’t care
less about some anti-bot defense on free emulator servers, so we didn’t spend
too much brain activity on it. Nevertheless, it was committed into the
Subversion repository with a completely unsuspicious “small fix” message (open
source!).</p>
<p>It sounds a lot like security by obscurity, as I’m writing it now. I am not an
anti-fraud expert, however, it looks like it really is — we need to detect some
suspicious activities, and then stop them in a way that doesn’t immediately tell
fraudsters about it. Why? To make “debugging” around our defense a much harder
problem.</p>
<p>For example, if we needed to do better with those bots, one way to go was to
keep track of a cumulative bot time on a player’s account in a database and ban
it some time into the future. Maybe an hour or two, maybe a day, or even a week.</p>
<p>There is also a technique called “shadow ban”, that’s sometimes used on
forums. For a shadowbanned person everything looks the same, they can view
everything and post comments, just their responses are not visible to anyone
else (except moderators), so they’re not causing a stir on a forum, and do not
launch attacks onto it from other places, because they do not perceive it as an
attack on them.</p>
<p>We could have employed something akin to a shadow ban. Stop bots from interacting
with other users from time to time. Drop their packets a lot when they’re in a
battlefield, so they and their party-members end up being killed by mobs.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s always possible to employ these delayed responses — anything
financial and we’re out of luck? I’m not familiar with that field, never worked
at a bank or a payment processor. Would be interesting to learn a bit about
that.</p>
<p>So, back to classified ads. They could raise their defenses a bit, and with a
clever shadow ban technique (mark messages as read when a recipient logs in,
etc) it would eliminate a lot of the fraudulent activity from the platform.</p>
<p>If a fraudster tries this and tries that and there is no apparent benefit and it
seems like everything works, but people just don’t fall for a scam — will they
continue to try more and more sophisticated attacks? To a certain extent, later
they’ll get bored with having no results.</p>
<p>We also need good anomaly detection mechanisms. It starts with good logging and
monitoring, and with user complaints, just like any other performance problem or
a bug. Of course, later you can start to employ different machine learning
techniques, but it shouldn’t be the first step, and you need to do it really
carefully.</p>
<p>It’s very maddening for legit users to fall prey to some stupid algorithm that
can be hard to fix. Gather more cases and re-train a model? Maybe employ
heuristics to fix some corner-cases? In any case, a model's decision should be
overridable by moderators.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will pierce through your defenses anyway, so you’ll have to
react quickly, identify new patterns, shadow ban them, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be fixed by a product change. For example, if there is some
kind of bonus system, make it so users can spend bonuses only on themselves,
ship products paid with bonuses to the existing address only (that has a history
of successful deliveries from a given account), etc.</p>
<p>Removing an incentive to fraud is the best strategy.</p>
<p>After running a service for some time you’ll get a grip on how these things are
done.</p>
<p>Even Twitter seemingly managed to remove that Bitcoin “ElonMuskque
giveaways”. What took them so long I don’t understand, but if even Twitter did
it — you can do it too.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>

  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<![CDATA[Making VoIP Calls with Antique Rotary Phones]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>One of the worst parts of modern life is how <em>unsatisfying</em> it is to hang up on somebody. Tapping on the ‘End Call’ button on an iPhone or angrily clicking ‘Leave Meeting’ on Zoom just isn’t nearly as fun as slamming down the handset on a <em>real phone</em>.</p>
<p>This particular project was to breathe some life into the antique Northern Telecom phone from my grandparents’ house by attaching it to a modern VoIP system. This was surprisingly difficult, but very satisfying as the result is essentially a free ‘vintage’ landline for my home.</p>
<p><img src="https://nbailey.ca/images/nt500.jpg" alt="Northern Telecom model 500"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kentonkwok.com/telephones/WE500.php">Photo Source: Kenton’s Antiques</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-phone">The Phone</h3>
<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-dialling">Pulse Dialling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/pulse-dialing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/">Photo Source: RF Wireless World</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/MultiTone1.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling#/media/File:MultiTone1.png">Photo Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/images/D/small%202-212.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converter.html">Photo Source: OldPhoneWorks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

Today we share an interview exploring Joel’s more than four decades in the software industry.</h2><hr><h3>Let’s start at the beginning. What did you study in school?</h3><p>I started as a math major at UMBC with no thought of working with computers. A chess friend pushed me to take Intro to Computer Programming, and I reluctantly enrolled.</p><p>After struggling through the first half of this poorly taught Fortran class, it clicked and I was hooked. UMBC was too small to offer a CS major at the time. I took the three computer classes they offered, and then transferred to University of Michigan.</p><p>At that time there were three big players in mainframe computing: IBM, Univac, and Burrows. Michigan was an IBM school, so I learned IBM mainframe assembler, data structures, computer theory, and operating systems. Operating systems were tough. We wrote in IBM assembler adding paging and virtual memory to a fixed memory operating system.</p><h3>What was your first job out of school? What kind of technology were you using back then?</h3><p>I started my career working for the Detroit area school districts. COBOL was the lingua franca in 1975, although PL/1 and IBM assembler were occasionally used where I worked. Everything was batch processing, key punch cards, card readers, and flat files (which were mostly on tape because disk storage was so expensive). Online systems and databases had yet to hit the mainstream.</p><p>At my first job, I mainly supported batch COBOL applications for the school districts. We used Job Control Language (JCL)—a rather confusing “language” in its own right—to direct what programs to run, what files to read and write, and where to print the reams of output. We carried these JCL decks (to print, compile, and run) in our shirt pockets and always had rubber bands around our wrists.</p><p>The term “killing trees” was not an exaggeration! Computers didn’t have monitors. A single compile could generate 10 or more printed pages of 14″x11″ green bar paper, whereupon you’d find a typo in your program, re-punch a card, stick it in the deck and run it again. If the program compiled but blew up, you’d get a single error code and reams of hexadecimal core dump to decipher as you looked for your logic error.</p><h3>How did your early experiences shape your approach to programming?</h3><p>My very first assignment was to modify a complex statistical test scoring program in PL/1. The author, a PhD in statistics, fancied himself a programming wizard as measured by . . . brevity. Seriously!</p><p>This genius used one character variable names (a, b, c, etc..) or two if absolutely necessary (aa, ab, ac). He nested loops three-deep on one line. In a word, his code was undecipherable.</p><p>As I untangled his code, I vowed to myself I would never do that to anybody. I realized that we always write for the next person who will read our code. Code should be as clear and understandable as I can make it. This was before any standards or formalized methodologies existed. Today we call this idea “clean code” and it’s baked into the culture of BTI360.</p><h3>Can you summarize the changes you’ve seen over 4+ decades in this field?</h3><p>The technical changes are too vast to adequately describe: from punch cards and a “cutting edge” 16 MB IBM mainframe to Object-Oriented Programming, big data, and the internet of things. So many tools that we take for granted, like relational databases, did not exist when I started.</p><p>Corporate culture was also very different in my early career. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking was rampant until the late 80s. I’d sit in smoke-filled meetings and come out wheezing, reeking of tobacco. Also, the dress was different. I was required to wear a conservative suit, tie, and leather shoes until around 2000 when business casual became popular (my employer waited until <em>after</em> IBM relaxed their dress code).</p><p><a href="http://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4297" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/interview-looking-back-on-4-decades-in-the-software-industry/joelandles-captioned2/" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" data-orig-size="875,679" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="JoelAndLes-captioned2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" alt="" width="875" height="679" srcset="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg 875w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg 400w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-768x596.jpg 768w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-564x438.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px"></a>Maybe more surprising is how my own perspective shifted over four decades. Initially, I was attracted to programming because of all the cool stuff you could do with technology. But as I think back on my career, I realize that my focus gradually shifted to the high-powered teams and great relationships you could build around technology.</p><h3>Tell us about your experience working with W. Edwards Deming.</h3><p>Sure, for those who don’t know, Deming was an engineer turned management consultant. He went to Japan and had an enormous impact on their manufacturing industry. Many credit him with sparking the miraculous Japanese post-war economic recovery in the 1950s.</p><p>I encountered Deming when I was working at GM. He was brought in to consult with the division I was working in. I attended meetings with Deming and somewhere I have a grainy, out-of-focus photo of us together.</p><p>Deming was ahead of his time. He had a lot of ideas that were quite provocative to American automakers in those days. Some of his best ideas for GM were around improving the systems in which their employees worked—creating an environment for success. Management was so obsessed with individual performance, that they could miss systemic factors that were holding everyone back.</p><p>Of course, Deming’s influence continues to this day. You see his ideas reflected in agile methodologies as well as in books like <em>Drive</em> by Daniel Pink.</p><h3>You worked for Ross Perot as well?</h3><p>Yes. In 1984 GM acquired Ross Perot’s software company, EDS. All of GM’s IT folks either transitioned to EDS or quit. Although Perot is best known nationally for his quirky presidential bid and debate performances, he was very effective in the contexts where I encountered him.</p><p>Perot had been the top-selling salesman at IBM. He wanted them to get into software services, and when they didn’t he founded EDS to fill the need himself. EDS grew to be a multi-billion dollar company. Perot had a folksy, charming manner. I can still picture him sitting on a table in the front of a meeting room, rather than using the podium.</p><p>Perot was known for being loyal to his people. The most famous example is when he sent a team of civilians to Iran to free two wrongfully imprisoned EDS employees who had been working in Tehran. Perot oversaw the mission personally from Turkey. It’s a wild story that was documented in a best-selling book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Wings_of_Eagles">On Wings of Eagles</a></em>. I met one of the EDS employees who was rescued.</p><h3>What’s next for you in retirement?</h3><p>Plans?? I thought retirement was the time in my life I didn’t need to follow any plans! I certainly have a lot of interests and activities to keep me busy. I’ll continue to stay active with biking, running and swimming and do the occasional triathlon. I’ve always been intrigued by riding a unicycle. I plan to learn. I’d like also to get back into woodworking and photography.</p><p>My biggest near-term project is my retirement puppy, Cosmo, a little Havanese. I’m currently learning to be a dog owner and train a puppy. Eventually, I would like to train and certify him as a therapy dog and take him to comfort kids and the elderly in hospitals and long-term care facilities.</p><h3>Thanks so much for sharing these reflections with us, Joel.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to all our new subscribers! I write a weekly newsletter, sent out every Sunday, with curated quotes and one-line takeaways from material that I think is worth reading. Occasionally, I share my own thoughts, inspired by others’ writings, on Tuesdays. If you enjoy our newsletter, please share it with a few friends/colleagues or follow me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ButWhatForBlog">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><em>As always, any suggested materials for our Sunday newsletter can be sent to social@butwhatfor.com. </em></p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shel_Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a></strong> was an American writer, poet, cartoonist, songwriter, and playwright. He is known for his cartoons, songs, and children's books. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 20 million copies, and he was the recipient of two&nbsp;Grammy Awards (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZNZt5qVgvM">A Boy Named Sue</a>” as popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR5XGTpophI">Johnny Cash</a>, and a recording of his famous “<a href="https://amzn.to/35xJz6N">Where the Sidewalk Ends</a>”).</p><p>For her first Christmas, my parents got my niece Shel Silverstein’s <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends </em>(apparently expectations are high for the six-month mark). I grew up reading its collection of poems, over and over. I even - to the horror of some of my readers, I am sure - used colored pencils (because I didn’t yet appreciate the waxy beauty of crayons) to color in some of Silverstein’s famous illustrations. </p><p>The gift sent me down memory lane. Re-reading a selection of those poems from all those years ago, I was struck by just how much more there is to much of Silverstein’s writing than his characteristic style and funny words.</p><p>Take the namesake of that book - <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> - for example. As a child, reading the poem brought to me images of running out into a grassy field somewhere. And that is what Silverstein is writing about. </p><p>But why didn’t I realize that the place “before the street begins” was so radiant? It is “soft and white,” burning “crimson bright,” with a mint-sweet smell in the air. What happens, once we arrive in the city, that changes nature into a place where the “smoke blows black” and the winding “dark streets” are pitted and cracked?  </p><p>Are the “asphalt flowers” supposed to be nature succumbing to industry? Or are we even talking about nature?</p><p>Maybe we are the flowers, trapped in cracks of a toiling modern life - meaning we never grow into what we were meant to be? Why is it that only the children see the “chalk-white arrows” and know they lead to “the place where the sidewalk ends,” while adults might have forgotten how to get there altogether?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Where the Sidewalk Ends</strong></em></p><p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>And before the street begins,<br>And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>To cool in the peppermint wind.</p><p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>And the dark street winds and bends.<br>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p><p>Yes we’ll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And we’ll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>The place where the sidewalk ends.</p></blockquote><p>And what about the unhappy crocodile with a toothache? Isn’t it true that we often run through life <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">not listening to other’s difficulties because of our preoccupation with solely our own lives</a>, meaning others have no option but to do the same?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Crocodile's Toothache</strong></em></p><p>Oh the Crocodile<br>Went to the dentist<br>And sat down in the chair,<br>And the dentist said, 'Now tell me, sir,<br>Why does it hurt and where?'<br>And the Crocodile said, 'I'll tell you the truth.<br>I have a terrible ache in my tooth.'<br>And he opened his jaws so wide, so wide,<br>That the dentist he climbed right inside,<br>And the dentist laughed, 'Oh, isn't this fun?'<br>As he pulled the teeth out, one by one.<br>And the Crocodile cried, 'You're hurting me so!<br>Please put down your pliers and let me go.'<br>But the dentist just laughed with a Ho Ho Ho,<br>And he said, 'I still have twelve to go --<br>Oops, that's the wrong one, I confess.<br>But what's one crocodile's tooth, more or less?'<br>Then suddenly the jaws went snap,<br>And the dentist was gone right off the map.<br>And where he went one could only guess...<br>To North or South or East or West...<br>He left no forwarding address.<br>But what's one dentist more or less?</p></blockquote><p>And we all need to remember to not take ourselves too seriously because creativity doesn’t come without the chance of looking at least a little bit silly.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Put Something In</strong></em></p><p>Draw a crazy picture,<br>Write a nutty poem,<br>Sing a mumble-grumble song,<br>Whistle through your comb.<br>Do a loony-goony dance<br>'Cross the kitchen floor,<br>Put something silly in the world<br>That ain't been there before.</p></blockquote><p>But then I came across one of Silverstein’s works that I had not read before - thanks to the power of Google and the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/">endless curiosity of Maria Popova</a>. Flipping through the pages of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2MS9KhT">The Missing Pieces Meets the Big O</a></em>, I landed on a little bit of a different takeaway than Maria did. </p><p>She is probably closer to correct, but I thought I would share the story and my own thoughts anyway - which is related to <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/charlie-munger/">Charlie Munger</a>’s ideas on dealing with adversity: “<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/dont-feel-like-a-victim-facing-adversity-with-charlie-munger/">If you just take the attitude that, however bad it is in any way,&nbsp;it’s always your fault and you just fix it as best you can&nbsp;– the so-called ‘iron prescription’ –&nbsp;I think that really works.</a>”</p><p>Pictures sourced from <a href="https://archive.org/stream/missingpiecemeet00silv">Open Library</a>.</p><p>We meet a lonely, pointy shape that wants nothing more than to be able to roll.

<p><span>L</span>ast year, as Russia faced a rising tide of coronavirus infections, Tatyana Bakalchuk stepped into the spotlight. Newly <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/02/20/wildberries-founder-becomes-russias-richest-woman-a69365">crowned</a> as the country’s richest woman, the owner of online retail giant Wildberries released <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/3HAf/4TwvE8ZGU">a video statement</a> promising that digital merchants would rise to the challenge of lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting alone on a large sofa with her hands clasped firmly in her lap, Bakalchuk outlined a set of rules for pandemic-era internet trading before attacking shopping malls and stores for their irresponsible approach to safety, arguing they should instead be repurposed as collection points for online orders. “Stay at home, and we’ll take care of you and your loved ones,” pledged the founder. “We’re a great country that has more than once gotten out of the most difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Such public leadership was a departure for the poetry-writing former English teacher. In her 16 years in business, Bakalchuk typically avoided media scrutiny and claimed in an <a href="https://tass.ru/business-officials/8759963">interview last year</a> that she aspired to a “quiet life.” But as Wildberries consolidates its position as Russia’s biggest online retailer — its unmissable pink-and-purple branding can be found from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean — she has stepped out of the shadows. In recent years, Bakalchuk has, among other things, appeared at business conferences, held public meetings with ministers, and even attended celebrity events in an attempt to boost her public profile. A Wildberries spokesperson, however, declined to answer questions for this article.</p>



<p>Wildberries is comfortably ahead in the cutthroat race to become Russia’s Amazon. The company has underwritten its growth by catering to low-income consumers via offline collection points, free delivery, and rolling discounts. And the coronavirus pandemic has only strengthened its lead. With almost a million orders a day, Wildberries all but doubled its payroll last year and quadrupled the size of its supplier network to almost 80,000 firms and individuals. While real estate tycoon Elena Baturina officially reclaimed her title as Russia’s richest woman in 2020, <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/milliardery/414621-ocenka-sostoyaniya-vladelicy-wildberries-tatyany-bakalchuk-vyrosla-do-10-mlrd"><em>Forbes</em> magazine</a> has suggested that Bakalchuk’s personal fortune could be as much as $10 billion.</p>



<p>Bakalchuk has described how she set up the company a month after giving birth in 2004, while still suffering from postpartum depression. “I didn’t want to be known as just ‘someone with a child,’” she said in her first-ever video interview 14 years later. “I tried to return to what I was doing previously — I was a foreign-language tutor — but it didn’t work out because, of course, my child didn’t care about my schedule.” Instead, she invested $700 in a website that sold clothes, and a little more in online advertisements. When the first orders came in, she used her apartment as a makeshift warehouse and took public transport to deliver the packages herself. According to Bakalchuk, Wildberries has grown organically ever since.</p>



<p>This rags-to-riches origin story makes Bakalchuk highly unusual in Russia, where the state controls huge swathes of the economy, and the wealthy elite is almost entirely male. And it means Bakalchuk stands out from the country’s other billionaires, the majority of whom made their fortunes, directly or indirectly, from the extraction of mineral resources. Just like Wildberries’ name — chosen for its evocations of color and dynamism — Bakalchuk is seen as a breath of fresh air in Russia’s business world. Cultivating this persona has opened the doors of government ministers keen to cultivate homegrown business success and helped Bakalchuk win a following among members of the younger generation.</p>



<p>Despite its healthy lead in the e-commerce industry, Wildberries’ total dominance is far from guaranteed. The market in Russia is unusual because it consists almost entirely of local firms, including state-backed ventures, and is far more fragmented than its Western and Asian counterparts. Most experts believe the sector is on the brink of a turbulent period that will see the emergence of a few major players. “The market is moving toward consolidation because of rapid growth, not via mergers and acquisitions,” said Fedor Virin, co-founder of Russian e-commerce analysis firm Data Insight. Competition to come out on top is intense, pitting influential billionaires against state-owned financial behemoths.</p>

<p><strong>Wildberries has repeatedly</strong> denied ever receiving any significant outside investment, but many in the Russian e-commerce world are deeply skeptical of Bakalchuk’s “self-made” rhetoric, pointing to the company’s phenomenal growth and powerful friends as evidence. In 2019, year-on-year sales rose 88%, and analysts predict it will be over 100% in 2020, rising more than 2.5 times faster than the market as a whole. Even competitors with significant investments struggle to grow at these rates, fueling rumors of a secret investor or high-level state support. “There are concerns that a road is being cleared for Wildberries,” said retail sector analyst Aleksei Petrovsky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company’s business tactics unquestionably play a major role in its popularity among Russia’s 95 million active internet users (the largest in Europe). Wildberries operates a huge network of over 14,700 collection centers in low-rent suburban areas that also function as mini-distribution points and provide customers with a place to try on their purchases. It provides free delivery and free returns and has historically focused on products with higher profit margins, like clothes and shoes, which, as of May 2020, accounted for over 50% of sales.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A physical presence in towns and cities has, at least in the short term, helped Wildberries overcome the major hurdles facing other e-commerce companies in Russia: long delivery distances, scattered populations, a notoriously unreliable postal service, and a deep mistrust of upfront payment, a legacy of the turbulent transition from communism in the 1990s. </p>



<p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible,” Dmitry Alekseev, co-owner of large electronics retailer DNS, told <em>The Bell</em> last May. “Wildberries has more offline outlets than we do.”</p>

<p>Wildberries’ success is also built in part on its 2014 decision to transition to an Amazon-style marketplace, in which suppliers are simply offered a platform to make sales. The company doesn’t have to sink its own money into products and is able to retain control of pricing, meaning it can pressure suppliers to offer big discounts. This policy has alienated some of the companies that work with Wildberries, which accuse the retail giant of forcing their hand. “If you only work with Wildberries, you can easily destroy the rest of the market for yourself,” said one supplier who requested anonymity.</p>



<p>Grabbing market share has long been the company’s overriding goal. “[They] were always compulsively drawn to growth. They sensed that if they were not developing rapidly, they would be caught, overtaken, and trampled into the ground,” recalled a former employee, who feared retaliation. Occasionally, growth was prioritized over profit. The decision to implement free deliveries, for example, initially hit the company’s bottom line.</p>



<p>As the company began to reach into households all over the country, and Bakalchuk attracted increasing interest from both the media and senior government officials, it was no longer possible to outright refuse interviews and dismiss the need for a PR department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the start of 2018, Wildberries hired an external PR agency, which helped craft the tale of self-made female entrepreneurship, a narrative that Bakalchuk has since adopted as her origin story in interviews with top Russian media outlets. On the back of this carefully curated image of independence, however, the company has forged links in the heart of Moscow. One of Bakalchuk’s biggest cheerleaders is Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov, who has traveled with Bakalchuk on domestic business trips, announced major corporate decisions, and lobbied Wildberries’ interests abroad. And during the pandemic, Bakalchuk’s increasingly public reputation helped propel Wildberries to the top of Russia’s e-commerce sector.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Bakalchuk’s neatly packaged</strong> origin story downplays some key details. For starters, she is not the only decision-maker at Wildberries. Vladislav Bakalchuk, her husband — a soft-spoken man who reportedly owns 1% of Wildberries — was a successful businessman in the early 2000s and received a windfall when the internet provider he’d partly owned was sold in 2007. He and bodybuilder Sergei Anufriev occupy key positions in Wildberries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anufriev played an especially intriguing role in the early days of the company, brokering a large delivery of Adidas-branded goods for Wildberries in the late-2000s, after several other buyers declined, according to the former Wildberries employee. Back then, many Russian retailers were dependent on unwanted stock from major Western brands, a sizeable portion of which was shipped into the country using false customs declarations (the Russian Central Bank estimated in 2005 that these “gray imports” constituted as much as 20% of all imports).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the extent of Anufriev’s influence today is unclear, the heavily discounted Adidas items were the backbone of Wildberries’ catalogue during a crucial growth period for the company. Several years later, reputable Russian media outlets <a href="https://retailer.ru/asos-vstretjat-po-odezhke/">repeatedly identified</a> Anufriev as a co-owner of Wildberries. And the former …</p></div></div>

									<p>All modern computers have the ability to play high-quality digital sound, thanks to the presence of a dedicated sound card or an audio chip on the motherboard. Today’s computers produce lifelike, realistic audio, enabling us to listen to digital music collections, watch online videos and play action-packed games. However, the audio capabilities of today’s computers are the culmination of decades of development, and it took a significant contribution from the computer game industry to get us here. Without that contribution, anyone who isn’t a professional musician might still be listening to little more than beeps on his or her computer today.<br>

<p>If you had an IBM PC computer or a 100-percent compatible clone between 1981-1988, you were most likely listening to — or cutting the wires of — your computer’s internal speaker. The PC speaker was solely a rudimentary tone generator. It played one note at a time, didn’t have different instruments for composers to choose from and even lacked volume control. As a result, music played on the PC speaker tended to sound tinny and grating. Composers could get around these problems by varying the pitch of a note slightly to create vibrato and playing fast arpeggios to simulate the sound of multiple notes being played simultaneously. By playing short “blips” between notes — short low-pitched sounds in the middle of a longer, high-pitched sound, for example — it was possible to simulate percussion. However, most PC speaker music didn’t have this much effort put into it; game music from this era often sounded rather monotonous. Through a clever hack, some computer games from the late ’80s actually played 6-bit digital sound through the PC speaker. However, this technology was used in few games because it was difficult to play digital sound through the speaker without sacrificing speed. When sound cards began to drop in price, the digital sound hack became irrelevant.</p>

<p>Hearing digital samples from an IBM-compatible computer before the release of the Sound Blaster was quite a novelty. Because of space limitations — <em>Space Racer</em>&nbsp;shipped on just one 5.25-inch floppy diskette — each sample is stored on the disk only once. The song is played by triggering the samples in a specific order.</p>

<h2>1984: IBM PCjr and Tandy 1000</h2>
</a><p><a name="2"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="IBM PCjr" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IBM-PCjr.gif" alt="IBM PCjr" width="250" height="212">The PCjr was released by IBM in 1984 as an attempt to provide better competition for Apple in the home computer market. The PCjr included features designed to appeal to home users, such as an infrared wireless keyboard, cartridge slots and expansion hardware that could be installed without opening the computer. More importantly, the PCjr featured enhanced graphics and a sound chip that could play three voices simultaneously rather than the one voice of the original IBM PC. IBM contacted the game company Sierra On-Line, asking them to design a game that would show off the enhanced graphics and sound of the PCjr. The result was <a title="King's Quest" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/kings-quest" target="_blank">King’s Quest</a>. The game became an enormous hit, saving Sierra from a failed investment in cartridge-based games just before the <a title="Video Game Crash of 1983" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983" target="_blank">video game crash of 1983</a>&nbsp;and spawning a series that lasted 14 years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Tandy 1000" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Tandy-1000.jpg" alt="Tandy 1000" width="250" height="111">Some of IBM’s design decisions for the PCjr were poor ones, and the computer ultimately failed. However, Radio Shack’s Tandy 1000 — an IBM-compatible computer with the same video and sound capabilities as the PCjr — was a big seller. IBM still set the computing standard at that point, and since the PCjr wasn’t a success, not all games took advantage of the Tandy 1000’s advanced sound capabilities. Those that did provided a significantly better audio experience on the Tandy 1000 than they did on the IBM PC.</p>
<h3>Listen to the Tandy 1000</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Silpheed Game Screenshot" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Game-Screenshot.gif" alt="Silpheed Game Screenshot" width="320" height="200"><span><strong>Silpheed (1988)</strong></span></p>
<p>Although the sound chip of the Tandy 1000 lacked an effects channel for percussion, the three-voice polyphony made it possible to construct a full piece of music with melody, harmony and bass. The Tandy 1000 version of the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack was a significant improvement over the PC speaker version.</p>

<p><audio id="audio-3009-6" preload="none" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3?_=6"><a href="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3">http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3</a></audio></p>

<p>The Tandy 1000 version of the introduction piece for <em>Rendezvous With Rama</em>&nbsp;conveys the full effect of what the composer intended, while the PC speaker version could only “fake” it by switching from voice to voice. Because the quality of PC game music was generally rather low in the early ’80s, hearing such a complex piece at the beginning of a game was a real treat.</p>

<p>The PC speaker version of <em>Music Construction Set</em>&nbsp;was done so well that the difference between it and the Tandy 1000 version isn’t quite “night and day” as it is with some other games. However, because the Tandy 1000 could play multiple voices without tricks, the tones do sound less “fuzzy.”</p>

<p><em>Composed by Hibiki Godai. Developed by Game Arts and published by Sierra On-Line.</em></p>
<p><em>Thexder</em>, the pinnacle of PC action gaming in 1987. features an appropriately energetic soundtrack that makes use of arpeggios to suggest chord changes. If the music sounds familiar to you, it may have something to do with the fact that Hibiki Godai also contributed to the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack.</p>

<h2>1987: AdLib Music Synthesizer</h2>
</a><p><a name="3"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AdLib-Music-Synthesizer-Card.jpg" alt="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" width="250" height="205">A few different sound cards were available to purchase in 1987, but few people other than professional musicians were aware of them. Sierra On-Line became a driving force in the evolution of computer sound again, approaching AdLib and Roland about putting together bundles of their products — the AdLib Music Synthesizer card and Roland MT-32 sound module — for Sierra to market. Sierra then hired&nbsp;professional musicians such as William Goldstein (<a title="Wikipedia: Fame" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fame_(1982_TV_series)" target="_blank">Fame</a>) and Bob Siebenberg (<a title="Supertramp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp" target="_blank">Supertramp</a>) to compose soundtracks supporting these devices for their upcoming games. Sierra also mailed&nbsp;<a title="A Letter From Ken Williams" href="http://queststudios.com/quest/music.html" target="_blank">letters</a> and demonstration cassettes to its customers&nbsp;to promote the AdLib and Roland MT-32, and the consumer sound card market was born.</p>
<p>Although the Roland MT-32 was a far better synthesizer, it was the AdLib Music Synthesizer card that would set the standard in PC audio for the next few years — mostly due to its lower price tag. The AdLib cost $200, making it far more affordable than the $550 MT-32 ($1,053 in 2012 dollars). The AdLib generated music with a&nbsp;Yamaha YM3812 chip, which produced sound through FM synthesis. The YM3812 was also known as the FM Operator Type-L 2 or OPL2&nbsp;chip; it could play up to nine voices simultaneously and produced tones by manipulating waveforms such as sine and half-sine waves. The sound quality was not unlike that of the inexpensive Japanese keyboards that many families had stashed under their couches in the late ’80s. The AdLib lacked the ability to produce true stereo audio or play digital sound samples of any kind. Nevertheless, it could produce rich, full sounds in the hands of skilled composers, as demonstrated by some of the samples below. Its primary shortcoming stemmed from the fact that many game music composers focused most of their efforts on high-end MIDI hardware such as the Roland MT-32 and Sound Canvas SC-55. In converting these soundtracks for the AdLib, little time was spent tweaking the music to highlight the AdLib’s strengths. Some of the best AdLib music was composed by <a title="Wikipedia: Demoscene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank">demoscene</a> members and shareware game companies, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning a new programming language can be challenging. There’s frequently a load of novel code patterns, techniques, and features.</p><p>Elixir, in particular, is a bit odd. While its syntax looks easy, it can be surprising. Even more, the semantics – Elixir code can sometimes be a puzzle even if you are a functional programming veteran.</p><p>For this post, I have gone through all the basic Elixir constructs and collected a few tips that will help you write idiomatic Elixir code without hours of Googling. It should be useful when you attempt your first Elixir project or do <a href="https://exercism.io/">Exercism</a> exercises.</p><p>If you have already finished Exercism or done an Elixir course, you will know most of this already, but it might serve as a good refresher.</p><p>Now, let’s see what Elixir can offer us. 😉</p><h2 id="basic-syntax">Basic syntax</h2><p>Seriously, just watch this video. It’s amazingly well done:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBNOavRoNL0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Additionally, you can visit the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html">Basic Types</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-operators.html">Basic Operators</a> guides on Elixir’s webpage.</p><h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/kc/kcyxakor.pasted_image_0_(8).png" alt="Mario image that somehow ilustrates Elixir pipes" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Hop into the pipes, and they take you weird places.</i></center><p>The pipe operator is the main operator for function composition in Elixir.</p><p>It takes the result of the expression before it and passes it as the first argument of the following expression. Pipes replace nested function calls like <code>foo(bar(baz))</code>with <code>foo |&gt; bar |&gt; baz</code> .</p><h3 id="example-of-pipes">Example of pipes</h3><p>For example, here’s a function that makes a string into an exclamation sentence.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaim</span></span>(string) <span>do</span>
  string
    |&gt; String.trim()
    |&gt; String.capitalize()
    |&gt; Kernel.&lt;&gt;(<span>"!"</span>)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Here, we take a string and pass it through various string methods. Since Elixir functions return the result of the last evaluated value, we don’t have to return anything. Data and transformations applied to it are clearly delineated.</p><p>Pipes look even more incredible when you use them to compose higher-level functions. The whole program can easily be one large pipe, consisting of smaller pipes, which consist of even smaller pipes. Pipes all the way down!</p><h2 id="higher-order-functions">Higher-order functions</h2><p>Elixir, as a functional programming language, makes heavy use of higher-order functions.</p><p>Higher-order functions take in other functions as arguments. A few examples of HOFs are map, filter, and reduce.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/na/na14enxf.pasted_image_0_(9).png" alt="Higher-order functions" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/TDA452/lectures/HigherOrderFunctions.html">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/</a> </i></center><p>In Elixir, most of these functions live in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html">Enum</a> module of the standard library and operate on anything that is <em><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a></em>: lists, maps, ranges, etc.</p><p>Using HOFs is a good substitute for loops: instead of a for-in, iterate over the elements of the list with <code>Enum.map</code>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; list = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]

iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, <span>fn</span> x -&gt; x * x <span>end</span>)
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>In the function above, we provided the square function as <code>fn x -&gt; x * x end</code>. This is Elixir’s syntax for anonymous functions. There is also another way to provide functions, and that is through the <em><a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/08/05/understand-capture-operator-in-elixir">capture operator</a></em>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, &amp;(&amp;<span>1</span> * &amp;<span>1</span>))
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>The <code>&amp;</code> initiates a new anonymous function, while the <code>&amp;1</code> denotes the first argument of that function. It’s debatable whether it makes it easier to read in this case. 😅</p><h3 id="example-of-higher-order-functions">Example of higher-order functions</h3><p>Let’s say we need to read a list of lines from a file, make them into exclamation sentences, and print them out to the console.</p><p>While we could usually do that with a loop, now we need another way. You can easily do it with a map function.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaimify</span></span>(file) <span>do</span>
  file
    |&gt; File.read!()
    |&gt; String.split(<span>"\n"</span>, <span>trim:</span> <span>true</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.map(<span>fn</span> x -&gt; exclaim(x) <span>end</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.join(<span>"\n"</span>)
    |&gt; IO.puts()
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Remember the capture operator we talked about? Here, you can use it to make it simpler to call <code>exclaim</code>. Just switch up the map function to <code>Enum.map(&amp;exclaim/1)</code>!</p><h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/rr/rr7zgnre.pasted_image_0_(10).png" alt="Elixir pattern matching meme" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Sneakily borrowed from <a href="https://www.ludu.co/course/discover-elixir-phoenix/pattern-matching">https://www.ludu.co</a></i></center><p>Pattern matching is one of the most powerful parts of Elixir. Any kind of control flow that you write, it’s a reasonable heuristic to check whether you can’t do it with pattern matching.</p><p>Basically, pattern matching works by providing some <em>pattern</em> you expect in the data and then checking whether this pattern <em>matches</em> the data.</p><p>It all starts with the match operator, <code>=</code>. Yup. In Elixir, we don’t assign variables; we <em>match</em> them.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>What happens here is that Elixir checks whether the structure of both sides is the same. If it is, unassigned variables on the left side get assigned the values from the right side. If it is not, it will skip to the next match statement (or give you MatchError if the match wasn’t exhaustive).</p><p>We can play around with it in IEx.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>

iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>2</span>
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side <span>value:</span> <span>2</span>

iex(<span>5</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>It starts to get much more useful when the structures are more complex, enabling you to destructure tuples, lists, and nested maps quite easily.</p><p><strong>Tuples</strong></p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; {x, y} = {<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>}

</code></pre><p>In the case of the code above, we can go even more idiomatic.</p><h3 id="multiple-function-clauses">Multiple function clauses</h3><p>Elixir supports pattern matching in function clauses. Therefore, instead of writing long-winded control flow statements, you can create multiple functions.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><p>Whoah! 🤯 If done correctly, this makes the code more extensible and easier to read.</p><h3 id="guards">Guards</h3><p>But there’s even more modularity incoming.</p><p>Let’s imagine we wanted to get the age only if Andrew is of legal age. We can easily accomplish this with a guard, an additional construction that augments pattern matching.</p><p>Guards consist of <code>when</code> and a boolean expression, and are added to the function clause. They support only a limited set of expressions, which you can check out in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html">documentation</a>.</p><p>Here’s how our code would look with guards:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &gt;= <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &lt; <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_legal_age</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><h3 id="overloading-functions">Overloading functions</h3><p>There’s this cool thing with Elixir functions where you can have functions with different argument counts, and they get counted as different functions even though they have the same name. In other words, you can overload functions via arity.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y), <span>do:</span> x + y
<span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y,z), <span>do:</span> x + y + z 
</code></pre><p>One of these functions in Elixir-speak is actually add/2, the other is add/3.</p><p>And, by using multiple functions and pattern matching, we can do a nice trick in our Elixir code that comes up quite often.</p><p>We can define an x-argument function that will serve as the outer shell of our function. Then, we use that x-argument function to launch an x+1-argument function that will track the state as an argument, not a variable.</p><p>It’s easier if you look at it in action. Here’s a function that reverses a list.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>(list), <span>do:</span> reverse(list, [])

<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([], list), <span>do:</span> 
<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([head | tail], reversed_list), <span>do:</span>
</code></pre><p>I have left the implementation details unfinished, and you might have a question or two about what is happening. Stay with me for a while. To fully explain it, we need to turn to recursive functions.</p><h2 id="recursive-functions">Recursive functions</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ko/kodpjcyk.pasted_image_0_(11).png" alt="XKCD tail recursion" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1270/">xkcd</a></i></center><p>A recursive function is simply a function that can call itself.</p><p>One of the typical examples is calculating a certain Fibonacci number, a naive implementation of which in Elixir would be:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(0), <span>do:</span> 0
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(<span>1</span>), <span>do:</span> <span>1</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(n), <span>do:</span> fib(n<span>-1</span>) + fib(n<span>-2</span>)
</code></pre><p>(Take note of our use of pattern matching covered above.)</p><p>We can find two things in each sane recursive piece of code: a base case and a recursive call.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Base case.</strong> This is the point where recursion terminates. It’s the result you want to achieve, and it will not call itself.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive call.</strong> This is where the program will do most of the computation. With it, you will reduce your task to a smaller one, and it will call itself.</li>
</ul><p>Basically, you can think of the base case as <em>the simplest possible example</em> of the task you want to solve and the recursive call as <em>a way to simplify</em> any given problem. In the example given, <code>fib(0)</code> and <code>fib(1)</code> are base cases, <code>fib(n)</code> is the recursive call.</p><h3 id="looping-with-recursion">Looping with recursion</h3><p>In Elixir, we use recursion much more frequently than you would in a non-FP language since we don’t have access to things like loops. Recursion mimics imperative behavior quite well.</p><p>For example, if we need to do something a set amount of times, we can create a recursive function with a number as an argument.</p><p>Let’s say that we want to duplicate a string any given number of times.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times, <span>""</span>)

<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(_string, 0, acc), <span>do:</span> acc
<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times, acc), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times - <span>1</span>, acc &lt;&gt; string)
</code></pre><p>Instead of initializing a variable in the function, we add one more argument to the function. Then we call it again and again, each time decreasing <code>times</code> and increasing <code>acc</code>.</p><p>In the end, we have achieved the same result as instantiating two variables – <code>i</code> and <code>acc</code> – and creating a while loop that decrements <code>i</code> until it is equal to 0 and adds <code>string</code> to <code>acc</code> on each iteration.</p><p>Now, I believe you will find it easy to complete the <code>reverse</code> example in the pattern matching section; it’s rather similar to <code>repeat</code> in structure.</p><h2 id="structs">Str…</h2></div></div>

      </section>
<p>2020 was a particular year for everyone, and Progressive Web Apps are no exception. In terms of innovation in the PWA space, it was the laziest of the last five years.</p>

<p>I will try to answer the most challenging question: <em>what's the market share of PWAs</em>? The only two companies with an accurate answer are Google and Samsung from their or WebAPK minting servers. Unfortunately, they are not sharing the data with us. Samsung disclosed a number at the end of 2019, but the company didn't update it since then. You can see it in the previous article <a href="https://firt.dev/pwa-2020">Progressive Web Apps in 2020</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A WebAPK minting server operates in the cloud and generates an APK (Android Package) -or delivers a cached version- every time you install a PWA when WebAPK is enabled. For Google Chrome, that's every time the browser is used to install a PWA that passes the PWA criteria, and for Samsung, it's every time Internet Browser is used in the same situation on a Samsung device. They have the data of how many unique manifest URLs -hence PWAs- are out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite not having that information, we can extrapolate some data from different sources, including <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/pwa">HTTP Archive 2020 Almanac</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, approximately <em>1% of websites included a Service Worker, and 2.2% had an installable Web App Manifest file</em>. Remember that some platforms -such as Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android- do not require a Service Worker to have a standalone experience after installation. We can assume that 2.2% of websites are installable, and 1% may pass the PWA criteria on Android, 71% of which offer some offline experience.</p>
<p>If we extrapolate the HTTP Archive data, the 2019 data shared from Samsung and apply the growth from HTTP Archive; the numbers will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>~120,000 domains may host at least one PWA.</li>
<li>~1,500,000 websites may be installable on mobile home screens, offering an app experience.</li>
<li>~600,000 websites may be offline-capable.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can compare this with app stores stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>~800,000 publishers on both Play Store and AppStore.</li>
<li>~2,000,000 apps in the AppStore, ~3,000,000 in Play Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite tricky to get this data accurate without real information from browsers, but it's clear that <em>PWAs are still behind native apps in the store in quantity and downloads</em>. Also, having <em>x</em> amount of websites that are ready to be installed doesn't mean users are actually installing them or even that they are aware that they are installable.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em> After publishing the first version of this post, the Chrome team reached me on a <a href="https://twitter.com/b1tr0t/status/1347656636991590401?s=20">Twitter thread</a> to share some of the public data they have from the WebAPK Minting server:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPK Installations per months: <em>10s of millions installations</em> only on Chrome for Android (compared that with around 10 billion installations per month on stores, iOS, iPadOS and Android)</li>
<li><em>Number of origins with PWAs has grown 170% in 2020</em>, outperforming the trend line for prior years. This is for domains with a minimum number of installs (so they are not just tests or internal PWAs)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, many solutions appear these days (low-code, no-code, CMS plugins) that will start creating a significant number of new PWAs. That situation is also possible on app stores with native apps, but each app needs an individual entry in the store, and app stores may limit similar apps. On the PWA side, you can create infinite different PWAs just by creating different manifest URLs, so it's always unfair to compare.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">What about PWAs in the stores? <a href="#what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>As with the rest of the data, it's challenging to find an answer here. First, TWA-based PWA launchers are still new in the Play Store, so they don't appear in the stats. The only thing that we can measure is how many hybrids are in the Play Store -apps using the WebView, including Cordova and Capacitor apps-.</p>
<p>Using data from <a href="https://www.appbrain.com/stats">AppBrain Stats</a> we can conclude that <em>12% of apps in the Play Store (around 360,000 apps) are using the Web View</em>. However, these apps are typically on the long tail as <em>they count as 2% of the downloads</em>.</p>
<p>While some of them may be using offline HTML content in the APK or using native plugins not available in the Web Platform, many are candidates to be replaced in the future with a Trusted Web Activity APK. We don't have data on AppStore, but we can assume that at least 50% of those apps in the Play Store are also available in the AppStore with the same codebase.</p>

<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to publish a PWA to App Stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data seems low, but when you look at browsing market share instead of quantity of apps, we can see that at 2021, <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/990">18% of page loads</a> have a Service Worker controlling them. It's also good to compare the platform's growth: <em>Service Workers' usage has increased 38% in the last year</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The platform is growing slowly, but it's not replacing the native world as some people were expecting a few years ago. Those of us in the Web space typically have a vision of PWAs not shared among the rest of the mobile app space. For example, Flutter had exponential growth in interest and usage last year, while PWA kept itself inside a niche.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will it change during 2021? We'll see in the rest of the article.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-compatibility">Current State of Compatibility <a href="#current-state-of-compatibility">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm currently maintaining a full <a href="https://firt.dev/notes/pwa/">live document with PWA compatibility</a>, so I don't want to repeat myself here. Let's see a summary and what has changed in the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Android</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome (WebAPK), Samsung Internet (WebAPK on Samsung devices), Firefox, Edge, UCWeb, Opera, Baidu, Brave, Huawei</li>
<li>Play Store: Trusted Web Activities</li>
<li>Enterprise: Managed Play iframe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>iOS and iPadOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Safari</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebView with App-Bound Domains (14+)</li>
<li>Enterprise: Mobile Configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 10</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: EdgeHTML engine, Chromium engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 7 and 8.x</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>macOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebView with App-Bound Domains (11+)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Linux</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome 64 bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>ChromeOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser</li>
<li>Play Store: Trusted Web Activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-in-numbers">Compatibility in numbers <a href="#compatibility-in-numbers">#</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2021, from users browsing the Web (data from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>95.1% support Service Worker</em></li>
<li><em>85.2% can install a PWA from their browser</em></li>
<li><em>76.3% can install a PWA from the store</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This data shows an increase of 2%－4% from a year ago.</p>
<p><em>Why isn't it 100%?</em> Let's see</p>
<ul>
<li>For Service Workers support, we still have some users browsing the Web on IE/Old Edge (1%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS before 14 (1%), Android Browser (0.5%), older Safari on mac (0.5%) and a mix of other older browsers.</li>
<li>For browser installation (Add to the Homescreen/Install), we have Safari on macOS (4%), Firefox on Desktop (3.2%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS on all versions (1.5%), IE/Old Edge (1%), Opera for Desktop and other browsers.</li>
<li>And the difference on store installation has to do mainly with macOS 10.x (7%), Windows 7 (6%), Windows 8.x (1.6%), and Windows XP (0.5%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-changes-during-2020">Compatibility changes during 2020 <a href="#compatibility-changes-during-2020">#</a></h3>
<p>In the past year, the changes in PWA compatibility were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huawei Browser</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebViews with App-Bound domains for iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11 (Big Sur)</li>
<li>Play Store on ChromeOS: Trusted Web Activity</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: Chromium-based WebView</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="huawei-browser">Huawei Browser <a href="#huawei-browser">#</a></h4>
<p>The Huawei Browser is a Chromium-based browser that appeared in 2020 for HMS-based devices, without Google Services, such as the Huawei P40 series. That browser supports the installation of PWAs, probably because it was already written in the Chromium code but not because there was a conscious decision.</p>
<p>In fact, during 2020, Huawei launched the <a href="https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/huawei-quickApp/">Quick Apps project</a> with other Chinese vendors, a sort of web app that can be used without installation, so it seems their way to support web apps in the platform.</p>
<h4 id="app-store-and-wkwebviews">App Store and WKWebViews <a href="#app-store-and-wkwebviews">#</a></h4>
<p>I will cover WKWebViews later in the article, but for now, let's say that PWAs are officially possible on the AppStore now, thanks to a new feature known as App-Bound Domains. It's available from iOS and iPadOS 14 and macOS from Big Sur, and Apple shipped it without any official word about their usage for the App Store.</p>
<p>I'm covering more about it in my recently published course <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps.</a></p>
<h4 id="play-store-on-chromeos">Play Store on ChromeOS <a href="#play-store-on-chromeos">#</a></h4>
<p>From ChromeOS 86, Trusted Web Activities are supported, so PWA Launchers distributed in the Play Store can be using TWAs. BubbleWrap CLIs and PWABuilder support the creation of PWA Launcher APKs just for ChromeOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to use Trusted Web Activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="microsoft-store">Microsoft Store <a href="#microsoft-store">#</a></h4>
<p>At the end of 2020, Microsoft announced <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> and support from <a href="https://medium.com/pwabuilder/bringing-chromium-edge-pwas-progressive-web-apps-to-the-microsoft-store-c0bd07914ed9">PWABuilder to create PWA launchers</a> for the Microsoft Store that can use the Chromium-based engine instead of the old EdgeHTML engine. Apart from the modern engine, there are several advantages, including sharing storages with the Edge browser installed in that device.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you change your PWA engine, you will also lose access to the UWP APIs available in previous versions. These APIs let you create, for example, Live Tiles for the Start screen.</p>
<h2 id="more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">More PWAs from Companies, in silent mode <a href="#more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>Many companies during 2020 launched new PWAs. Progressive Web App development is becoming a default for most companies, so they make it PWA …</p></section></div>

<p>
    Posted on January 11, 2021
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>I have written several posts on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">things that we got wrong in Futhark</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-12-08-why-futhark-sometimes-goes-wrong.html">why the compiler goes wrong</a>, as well as posts about <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html#size-types">complicated features</a> where it is still unclear whether the feature works well enough. However, there are also some parts of Futhark’s design that I feel pretty good about! This post will discuss some of them. I will focus on very concrete details, rather than grand observations such as “bulk-parallel functional programming is a good paradigm for numerical programming”. Such doctrinal statements are more of an entire <em>thesis</em>, and require much richer and more qualified answers than just “this turned out pretty well”. Everything to follow is what I don’t <em>regret</em>, so it is necessarily subjective, but maybe other language designers will find it useful or amusing.</p>
<h2 id="short-names"><a href="#short-names" id="short-names-link" title="short-names">Short names</a></h2>
<p>Naming things is one of the two most difficult problems in computer science, and in contrast to the other two (cache invalidation and off-by-one errors), there is no tooling or theory to tell you when you pick a bad name. Matters are even graver when it comes to names that are part of public interfaces. You may well receive acclaim for fixing a subtle cache invalidation bug in old and widely used code, but do not expect similar praise if you also change the naming convention of the public API from underscores to CamelCasing along the way.</p>
<p>Futhark exposes many names, both in its command line interface and its <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/">built-in libraries</a>. Many of the names have been changed over the years. When we initially fleshed out the primitive type system, I agonised over how to name the new types. Should 32-bit signed integers be <code>Int32</code> as in Haskell, or <code>i32</code> as in Rust? I worried the latter was <em>too short</em>. Yet in the end, that was the scheme we went with: <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code> for the signed types, <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code>/<code>u64</code> for the unsigned, and <code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code> for floats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here is a piece of advice: if you are ever agonising over some design detail that is not core to what makes your language special, and all options seem equally reasonable, just go with whatever Rust does. Odds are that whatever Rust decided was preceded by significant debate, and that whatever they picked has few gotchas. Lexical syntax is one area where this is particularly good (and easy) advice to follow.</p>
<p>But back to naming things. The terse type names turned out to work fine. In fact, I realised that <em>I have never regretted making a name too short</em>. The names I still regret tend to be those that are too imprecise or <em>too long</em> - the <code>negate</code> function in the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> modules should have been <code>neg</code>, for example. I am not quite sure why this is. When I code in Haskell, I have a preference for relatively verbose names for top-level definitions. In Futhark, short names just seem to fit better with the language aesthetics. Maybe that is just the nature of numerical code? I don’t know. But I definitely rely on this observation to guide future naming of things.</p>
<h2 id="file-orientation"><a href="#file-orientation" id="file-orientation-link" title="file-orientation">File orientation</a></h2>
<p>While Futhark is not designed for large programs, we still want to support multi-file programs. Code in a file <code>A</code> must be allowed to reference definitions in some other file <code>B</code>. Languages differ significantly in how they go about this. Futhark went for a particularly simple model: the declaration <code>import "foo"</code> allows access to the definitions in the file <code>foo.fut</code>, looked up relative to the importing file. That is all there is to it. If you know how a hierarchical file system works, then you know how Futhark looks up files. This is not textual inclusion as in C - each file still has to be syntactically valid on its own. We are not barbarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html">The philosophical background is spelled out here</a>, but the basic rationale is that <em>nobody enjoys learning about language import mechanics</em>, and in Futhark we can get away with doing something stupidly simple. Other languages, like Haskell and Java, put more effort into decoupling the notion of a “module” or “compilation unit” from that of a physical file. Even languages that reason in terms of files usually also provide support for a “search path”, where you provide the compiler with additional directories that are searched when including files.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that for larger programs with multiple directories of source files, a file has no unique way to be referenced (except for its absolute pathname, which is not practical), so you may need to use different relative paths in different files (e.g. <code>"../lib/foo"</code> and <code>"../../lib/foo"</code>). Another downside is that you cannot have a central repository of “system files” that are always checked (like <code>/usr/include</code> in Unix).</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> advantage of the design is that each file in a program can be processed as the “root”, without having to look for some kind of project definition file that contains necessary compiler directives such as include paths. This has allowed very lightweight zero-config tooling, such as a “go to definition” command in <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-mode">futhark-mode</a> and showing the types of variables - something that most Emacs modes definitely do not have without additional configuration.</p>
<p>Clearly this solution wouldn’t work for all languages, but it has worked really well for Futhark. I was initially worried because this design is much more similar to <em>bad</em> languages (like shell script) than to <em>good</em> languages (like Haskell), but it hasn’t caused problems yet, and I don’t recall any Futhark programmers ever being confused about how <code>import</code> works. This is the right design for Futhark, and I don’t expect to regret it any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-10-10-block-comments-are-a-bad-idea.html">These remain a bad idea</a>. Emacs has <code>M-x comment-region</code> and inferior editors likely have something similar. No regrets. In fact, my experience writing more <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-08-31-beginning-a-collection-of-futhark-examples.html">semi-syntactic tooling</a> has only strengthened my conviction. Line comments are easy to parse in an ad-hoc way, and it is particularly nice that there is only one way of writing comments.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-binding"><a href="#explicit-binding" id="explicit-binding-link" title="explicit-binding">Explicit binding</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a record type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>type</span> t = {foo: i32, bar: bool}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a function definition we can bind variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to the field contents as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo=a, bar=b}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if we wish to bind variables with the same names as the fields, there is a shorthand syntax inspired by OCaml and Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo, bar}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These languages also support an even more concise form:</p>

<p>This implicitly binds variables with the same names as the record fields. Futhark does <em>not</em> support this. The reason is a philosophy of never bringing names into scope unless those names are actually syntactically present at the binding site in some form. There are many things I enjoy about programming, but guessing where some variable comes from is not among them. I find C++’s policy of implicitly bringing class fields into scope inside method bodies to be particularly confusing.</p>
<p>My distaste for complex binding structure goes further: Futhark requires that all definitions occur <em>before</em> their first use. Originally this was just for implementation simplicity, but I have come to enjoy the restriction. It’s nice not to worry so much about the best definition order, because the compiler already ruled out most options. OCaml and SML have similar restrictions, so this is not <em>just</em> Futhark aping some 70s Pascal dialect.</p>
<p>The one exception to this explicitness principle is the <code>open</code> statement, which brings names from another module into scope. While a plain <code>open</code> is rare, it is used implicitly by <code>import</code>. There are also <em>local open</em> expressions, which allow us to write e.g. <code>M.(x*y+z)</code> with the names in module <code>M</code> in scope within the parenthesised expression. This is <em>really</em> convenient when writing advanced modularised numerical code, as the alternative is the much more clumsy <code>x M.* y M.+ z</code>. I am not sure how to reconcile this with our general principle, but maybe you just can’t be a fundamentalist all the time.</p>
<h2 id="no-dependencies"><a href="#no-dependencies" id="no-dependencies-link" title="no-dependencies">No dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Futhark is written in Haskell, and all of its code dependencies are either pure Haskell libraries or embed small amounts of C code. This means that it is quite easy to build the Futhark compiler - all you need is a standard Haskell build tool like <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code>, which is supported and documented on most operating systems. I do not recall anyone having trouble installing the compiler itself. Difficulties tend to be more in the direction of setting up GPU drivers on Linux (yet another of the great unsolved problems in computer science).</p>
<p>This policy is not all upside. For many years, we lugged around a home-brewed implementation of algebraic simplification because we were averse to native code dependencies. We also generate C code (compiled with the system C compiler) rather than interacting directly with LLVM the way <a href="http://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> does it. This means that there are some things we cannot efficiently express in our generated code. On the other hand, Accelerate’s dependency on LLVM can make it tricky to install, unless your system happens to have the right version of LLVM installed (and HPC systems and servers running <em>mature</em> versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tend not to). <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a> provides compiler binaries that embed a statically linked version of LLVM - this <em>may</em> be a direction we could go in, but I suspect statically linking LLVM with a Haskell program is more tricky than linking it with C++. And frankly, I think I already spend too much time hacking on build systems and CI setups.</p>
<p>We have gone quite far with this focus on installation simplicity. For example, the <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-pkg.html">Futhark package manager</a> does not even use native code to download packages. Instead, it shells out to <code>curl</code>. This has allowed us to statically link the Futhark binary that we provide for releases, a well as not having to worry about certificate store configuration. If you can download with <code>curl</code> in the command line, then <code>futhark pkg</code> will work. And if your system requires you to configure a special proxy or whatnot, then whichever configuration files or environment variables that <code>curl</code> respects will also work for <code>futhark pkg</code>.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant about this …</p></div></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

      <section>
        <p>Something really interesting happens when you consume a boatload of information: your brain begins to pick out patterns from the mass of stories in your head. This is true regardless of whether it’s books that you’re reading, or podcasts, or even just research programs that you’re executing (I know friends who — on becoming a parent — go <em>deep</em> into child development research; the same thing probably happens for them once they cross a certain threshold of information consumption.)</p><p>I read 53 books last year, most of it as an alternative to therapy for pandemic-related burnout. If a stranger were to look at my list of books, it would look like a random grab bag of topics, authors, and ideas. But when <em>I</em> look at my list, I see books falling into clusters, each cluster representing a set of questions I want answered, and in some cases have been investigating for a number of years now.</p><p>I thought I’d start 2021 with one of the questions that leapt out at me over the course of 2020, along with the books (and external sources!) that I consumed in order to investigate it.</p><h2 id="uber-how-do-you-see-into-the-future">Uber: How Do You See Into The Future?</h2><p>I read Mike Isaac’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44573628-super-pumped">Super Pumped</a></em> and Brad Stone’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29905580-the-upstarts">The Upstarts</a></em> fairly late in the year last year, shortly before the Airbnb IPO, and two years after the Uber one.</p><p>The books are ostensibly about Uber’s rise to greatness (and in <em>Super Pumped</em>, Uber’s fall from greatness). Both authors spend some time on the structural and technological changes that led to the rise of the sharing economy, but the bulk of the book is focused on the narrative arc of the main actors. I sometimes read such business biographies and struggle to find useful, generalisable things that I can learn from them — you would think that in Uber’s case, the lessons might be “winning at any cost is often not worth it” or “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-uber-dilemma/">VCs might stab you in the back if you represent too large a size of their portfolio, because this turns things into a finite game</a> (vs an infinite one)” and “you really really <em>really</em> need to get lucky if you want to take advantage of a structural shift; nobody recognised the underlying reasons for the sharing economy until <em>after</em> the fact”. As with many business biographies, the lessons are often too specific to the story to matter; you read the narrative simply to add an extra business pattern to your head.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But that last lesson — on the recognition of structural shifts — isn’t exactly true. While nobody could say that they understood the <em>full</em> opportunity in ride-hailing, I think there’s a plausible case that Uber board member and venture capitalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gurley">Bill Gurley</a> saw more than most. I spent three books and a couple of podcast episodes looking into it last year — mostly because I was interested in the kind of thinking that allowed Gurley to bet big on Uber. In other words: what did Bill Gurley <em>see</em>? What did he focus on in the fog of uncertainty around early ride-hailing? And how did he pick the right horse?</p><p>It’s easy to forget that in the early days of ride-hailing, it wasn’t at all clear that Uber would emerge as the winner. One of the dangers of reading business history is that everything seems pre-ordained — <em>of course</em> Uber would win; <em>of course</em> they would prevail against government regulation; <em>of course</em> Kalanick was a ridiculously effective combatant in the ride-hailing wars. But for a taste of what it must’ve felt like circa 2011, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">recall how the fog of uncertainty felt in the early days of the pandemic last year</a>, or even the confusion one feels about the multitude of crypto projects today.</p><p>To hear Isaac and Stone tell it, Gurley met with <em>every</em> Uber-like startup in the 2010-2011 period, long before ride-hailing was on most peoples’s radars. He eventually backed Travis Kalanick and Uber. The story isn’t that straightforward, however: before he found Kalanick, he offered $8 million to Taxi Magic at a $32 million valuation (he was turned down), and tried to get into an early Cabulous financing round (the founder, John Wolpert, told him the round was ‘full’).</p><p>How did Gurley win? One — trite — answer is that Gurley got lucky. He had been searching for taxi-related marketplace startups for many months, and found Uber only after every other competitor had turned him down. It was thus a stroke of luck that the first — and last! — deal he made in the market turned out to be the winning one.</p><p>But that trite answer obscures another fact: when it comes to marketplace startups, Gurley has had a hell of a track record. He invested in GrubHub, Nextdoor, LiveOps, OpenTable, Stitch Fix, and Zillow, amongst others. And indeed, whenever I listen to Gurley talk about marketplaces or network effects on a podcast or at an interview, his comments tend to be a <em>lot</em> more nuanced when compared to his contemporaries. You get the feeling that he’s skimming from the surface of a very deep pond.</p><p>Take, for instance, this <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/12224182/gurley-all-things-business-and-investing">interview</a> with Patrick O’Shaughnessy:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> And I've come up with this phrase I use internally that I made up. So one day I'll have to write a definition of it, but I call it liquidity quality. And I tell entrepreneurs, “I care way more about that than I do how broad you are. We can use venture dollars and growth playbooks to go broad if the fires burning bright. And so how do you get this liquidity quality high?” And Jeremy <em>(the Yelp founder)</em>, being at those nightclubs in San Francisco and people being super passionate and their review frequency being high, that caused the quality of the experience, even though it was in a very small area.<p>And so I very frequently run into entrepreneurs who think they need to expand to 10 cities really quickly to raise their A or their B or whatever. And I'm like, “No, if you have like incredible unit economics and growth metrics in a single city where it's obvious that your playbook's working and things are spinning and things are getting better and you're basically having network effects, that's way more interesting.”</p><p><strong>O’Shaughnessy:</strong> Are there interesting markers of whether it's liquidity quality or the health of the network itself in a contained area that you find especially interesting?</p><p><strong>Gurley:</strong> I mean, I think that's exactly what you have to look for. The reason I can't say measure A, B and C is you have to know the system that you're looking at and then define what that is. But I think every company that's trying to build a marketplace, UGC <em>(user generated content) </em>and network effect, should have some definition of what quality looks like or liquidity threshold that matters and track it like crazy.</p></blockquote><p>Gurley’s conception of ‘liquidity quality’ made me sit up. If you spend enough time sniffing for <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-mental-model-faq/">tacit mental models</a>, you would learn to recognise signs of expert pattern recognition. Gurley’s inability to articulate ‘liquidity quality’ was likely due to the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">tacit</a> nature of his recognition: that is, the LQ metric was different for every marketplace startup that Gurley had seen; he could — to paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart — “know it when he saw it”. Later on in the podcast, for instance, Gurley explains:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> … Tinder, ironically did this with parties, not really a UGC, but kind of a UGC company in each city that they would launch in because you want to get the quality up to a certain high level. And Nextdoor, we did the craziest thing in the world. We said, "Until you get to 10 members, you can't open your neighbourhood." So intentionally restrictive because we didn't want ghost town experiences and we knew quality of the experience was a function of how many neighbours were in your system.<p>So we thought the anticipation of getting in was a better user experience than getting in and finding it poor. And so we'd encourage you to go find the other so you could unlock your neighbourhood, is almost like a game heuristic. And so every one of these you'll find there's somebody that understands that nuance and about how this is going to tip and have some type of growth playbook is what people would call it. But I find the number of entrepreneurs that are capable of successfully launching a UGC play is a very small fraction, maybe less than 1% of all entrepreneurs. And they just tend to have a nuanced feel for what it takes to make something come alive and the feature sets that matter and how much they care about quality, I keep going back to that word, but it's what makes the kind of fire burn and then makes it possible to grow into ever bigger circles.</p></blockquote><p>Think about the implication of that insight: Gurley and company restricted the growth of Nextdoor in order to optimise for ‘liquidity quality’ — that ineffable mix of user value and density; they only allowed it to spread to neighbourhoods that were <em>adjacent</em> to existing ones with high LQ. That way, when you signed up for Nextdoor, you would be able to search for reviews of local businesses and services, because it would have already been filled in by users in the adjacent neighbourhoods.</p><p>My point: Gurley appears to have thought <em>really deeply</em> about the nature of networked marketplaces, at a level above many of his peers. One reason for this might be that he started much earlier compared to everyone else:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> So between '93 and '96 I was working on Wall Street at Credit Suisse First Boston in the research department. And literally the first or second day fell into a friendship with Mike Mauboussin, who you've had on many times and who you know well. And Mike and I, even though he was the food analyst and I was the tech analyst, we started sharing ideas and books and whatnot and I actually don't remember which one of us, he might remember, had a book called Complexity by Mitchell Waldrop which was about the rise of the Santa Fe Institute. And in that book, Brian Arthur is one of the heroes, early professor at Santa Fe Institute and someone that had a lot of different radical ideas. And so we had read that book and I think visited Santa Fe and met Brian, but this notion of increasing returns that some company that got to a big level would find it even …</blockquote></section></div></div>

<p>On Tuesday, 15<sup>th</sup> of December, Ethiopian federal troops and Amhara militia approached the Mariam of Zion cathedral in the Tigrayan city of Aksum. It is possible that they thought that Tigrayan troops were sheltering in the church – taking advantage of the ancient right of sanctuary. According to a number of sources the church was full, with some saying that up to 1,000 people were in the building or the compound surrounding it.</p>
<p>The advancing soldiers caused consternation: a chapel in the compound is believed by Ethiopians to house the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Only a monk – appointed as its guardian – may see it. There was a huge commotion. Amhara soldiers are reported to have shouted that “the Ark belongs in Addis Ababa!” but this cannot be confirmed. Those inside the cathedral came out to try to defend the sacred object.</p>
<p>A confrontation ensued. Everyone in the compound was forced into the square outside the cathedral. As the crowd milled around, there was further shouting and the troops opened fire on the protesting crowd. As many as 750 people are reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>News of the massacre has only gradually reached the outside world. People walked over 200 kilometres to the regional capital, Mekelle, and from there the story gradually filtered out – despite the clamp-down on the media in Tigray.</p>

<p>News of the massacre follows confirmation by the Ethiopian authorities that one of the most sacred Islamic sites, the Nejashi Mosque in the town of Wukro, had been badly damaged in fighting.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.omanobserver.om/the-untold-story-of-king-negash-and-the-al-nejashi-mosque/">built</a> in the 7th century by the companions of the Prophet Mohammad, some of whom are buried at the site.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government accepts the damage took place, and promises to restore the building, which is one of the oldest mosques in the world.</p>
<p>The government say it was attacked after Tigrayan troops dug trenches around the mosque.</p>
<p>Independent journalists are being prevented from visiting the Tigray region – the site of a fierce conflict between Tigrayan fighters and Ethiopian and Eritrean troops, supported by Amhara militia.</p>

January 12, 2021 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/hausdorff/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/hausdorff/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this post, I want to briefly discuss the Hausdorff distance, its
uses, and its extensions. Prior to delving into this, we need to
understand our setting here. We are dealing with a metric space $(X,
\operatorname{d})$ and its subsets. A metric space is, in some sense,
one of the most fundamental mathematical objects that everyone is
working with, either consciously or unconsciously. It is defined as
a space, i.e. a set of points&nbsp;(or objects in general, but for the
sake of intuition, I will only refer to points), together with a distance
function $\operatorname{d}\colon X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$, the
eponymous <em>metric</em> of the space. This function must satisfy three
properties for all points $x, y, z \in X$:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = \operatorname{d}(y, x)$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, z) \leq \operatorname{d}(x, y) + \operatorname{d}(y, z)$</li>
</ol>
<p>These properties are usually also known as the ‘identity of
indiscernibles’, ‘symmetric’, and the ‘triangle inequality’,
respectively. Property 1 just tells us that we can always distinguish
between points that are <em>not</em> the same—the metric is zero if and only
if the points are identical. Property 2 is a symmetry condition, telling
us that the order in which we evaluate the arguments of the function
does not matter. Finally, Property 3 indicates that the distance between
two points is never larger than adding a third point in-between. It is
called the <em>triangle inequality</em> because the sides of a triangle can be
seen to satisfy this. We can also reformulate it as stating that the sum
of the lengths of any two sides in a triangle must be greater than or
equal to the length of the last side.</p>
<p>The quintessential example of a metric space is the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the usual Euclidean distance between
points, i.e. $\operatorname{d}(x, y) := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^d(x_i - y_i)^2}$.
While there are all kinds of interesting relaxations of the three
aforementioned properties, leading to things such as pseudometrics,
I want to focus on a very simple question here: given two finite
subsets $X_1, X_2 \subset X$, possibly of different sizes, can we
measure their distance from each other?</p>
<p>It turns out that we can and this is where we need the Hausdorff
distance! Before giving definitions, let us look at an example and see
how we could define such a distance ourselves. To this end, assume that
these are our two subsets $X_1$&nbsp;(in red) and $X_2$&nbsp;(in blue):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/point_clouds.svg" alt="An example of two sets in a metric space" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>To motivate our first definition for the Hausdorff distance, note that
if $X_1 \subset X_2$&nbsp;(or vice versa), it would be easier to
calculate the distance, because we would only have to account for the
parts that are <em>not</em> part of the subset, and we would have to measure
how far it is to every other point of the smaller subset. With this in
hand, let’s <em>pretend</em> that $X_1$ and $X_2$ can be <em>turned</em> into subsets
of each other! To this end, we define the $\epsilon$-thickening for
$\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ as the space we obtain by replacing every
point $x$ in the sample by an $\epsilon$-ball, i.e. the set of all points in
the metric space $X$ that are at most $\epsilon$ units away from $x$.
This has the effect of ‘squinting’ at a subsample. Let’s illustrate this
for the circle:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/circle_05.svg" alt="An $\epsilon$-thickening of a circle" height="128"> <figcaption>
            <p>An $\epsilon$-thickening for $\epsilon = 5$</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>We can of course increase $\epsilon$ to ‘squint even more’:</p>

<p>How do we know when to <em>stop</em>, though? Well, we can stop once <em>both</em>
$X_1$ and $X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the
respective other space!  Using the notation $X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ for the
$\epsilon$-thickening of $X_1$&nbsp;(and analogously for $X_2$), this
leads to our first definition of the Hausdorff distance as
$\operatorname{d}_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \inf \left\{ \epsilon &gt; 0 \mid X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}
\right\}$.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly disentangle this! We define the distance between $X_1$ and
$X_2$ as the <em>smallest</em> $\epsilon$ that we need such that both $X_1$ and
$X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the other space. As
a simple example, consider thickening both $X_1$ and $X_2$ with
increasing values:</p>

<p>We can see that it takes large values of $\epsilon$ for $X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ to
hold. Let’s take a look at an alternative definition. To this end,
assume that an adversary can place you on one point of one of the sets.
Your goal is to travel as quickly as possible to the <em>other</em> set. The
Hausdorff distance is now the <em>longest</em> distance the adversary
can force you to travel. We can formulate this as follows:</p>
<p>$$d_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \max\left\{\sup_{x_1 \in X_1} \inf_{x_2 \in X_2} d(x_1, x_2), \sup_{x_2 \in X_2} \inf_{x_1 \in X_1} d(x_1,x_2)\right\}$$</p>
<p>Note the inherent symmetry of the two terms in the distance here. The
first one calculates the distance from the perspective of $X_1$, looking
for the point $x_1 \in X_1$ that <em>maximises</em> the <em>minimum</em> distance to
$X_2$. The second term works analogously.</p>
<p>The two definitions yield the same distance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This is intuitive
to see when you consider that if we follow the first definition, we end
up with a value for $\epsilon$ that is precisely the worst-case bound
for the distance one needs to travel to go from set to the other set. On
the other hand, following the second definition, we can construct the
$\epsilon$-thickening and it will be guaranteed—thanks to the
symmetry condition—that there is no point in either one of the sets to
lie outside the thickened space.</p>
<p>This covers the case for subsets from the <em>same</em> metric space $X$. But
what can we do if we have two <em>different</em> compact<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> metric spaces $X$ and $Y$&nbsp;(or subsets
thereof), each one with their own metric? To solve this case, we will
use a trick and use an intermediate space. This leads to the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance $d_\mathrm{GH}(X, Y)$, which is defined as
the <em>infimum</em> of all Hausdorff distances $d_\mathrm{H}\left(f(X), g(Y)\right)$,
where $f\colon X \to Z$ and $g\colon Y \to Z$ are <em>isometric embeddings</em>
into a shared metric space $Z$.</p>
<p>In other words: we are looking for two functions $f$ and $g$ that leave
the distances in $X$ and $Y$ intact—hence the term <em>isometric</em>—so
that we can measure the Hausdorff distance in the shared space $Z$
instead. As you can imagine from the definition, the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance is tough to calculate because finding an
appropriate $f$ and $g$ is not easy. Nevertheless, the Gromov–Hausdorff
distance has some fascinating properties and is one of the ‘workhorses’
in geometrical data analysis. If you want to learn more, I can highly
recommend reading the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1057432.1057436">Comparing Point Clouds</a> by <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1">Facundo
Mémoli</a> and <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/guillermo-sapiro">Guillermo Sapiro</a>.</p>
<p>Happy distance calculations, until next time!</p>

        <div>
            <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">   Prologue: getting muted in a a video conference <a href="#prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>As is the trend for many since 2020, I am working remote, and as a result in a lot of video conferences.</p>

<p>One silver lining with being remote is the ability to take notes: by nature of video conference, you’re in front of the computer, so it’s a lot easier to take notes on your computer without looking like you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>In one such meeting, I was notified how I was muted in the middle while someone else was talking: it turns out my keyboard noise was quite audible! How embarassing.</p>

<p>So thus started the quest to find the quietest keyboard possible.</p>
                <h2 id="whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">   What’s causing the noise when I type? <a href="#whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For context: I use an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ergodox-ez</a>. I didn’t realize it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoDoxEZ/comments/9ls494/ergodoxez_case_seems_very_loud/">loud noise with the Ergodox EZ is a common issue</a>.</p>

<p>On the ergodox-ez page, there is a lot of discussion around keyswitches (the thing that detects the key being pressed) and how much they affect noise. I chose the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html">Cherry MX Browns</a> since they are made to be silent, but still provide a tactile feel.</p>

<p>But after experimenting with different keyboards, removing some pieces, and changing my style, I’ve found that keyswitches are just one piece of the puzzle. The additional factors I found were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keycaps: the cap you put on the key switches. Once you put the keycap on, the clacking becomes louder, seemingly due to the resonation of the keys to the bottom of the switch.</li>
  <li>keyboard housing: the reverberation that occurs in the housing can be significant. This occurs while the key is being pressed, and even once it’s released.</li>
</ul>

<p>When holding a decibel meter up to where my microphone is during calls, and when typing a single key in a rhythmic fashion, I found that my ErgoDox produces noise of 62.8 decibels (dB) of loudness. My voice talking normally (and also much closer to the mic) is roughly 72 dB.</p>

<p>To be silent for practical purposes, the keyboard would have to produce below 40dB of noise: that’s roughly the loudness of a library.</p>
                <h2 id="keyboard-components-in-depth">   Keyboard components in depth <a href="#keyboard-components-in-depth">#</a>   </h2>
                    
                <h3 id="keycaps">   Keycaps <a href="#keycaps">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>As mentioned previously, keycaps are the cover for a key, and is often marked with the key that would be typed if pressed. A little research shows that <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69537.0">PBT plastic dampens higher frequencies</a>. These seemed to be loud in my case.</p>
                <h3 id="o-rings">   O-rings <a href="#o-rings">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>If your keypresses are loud, it’s common to just add o-rings (plastic rings that wrap the stem of your keycap) rather than brand by new switches. I’ve found the use of o-rings to be hit or miss, but generally they do play a part in reducing the noise of your keypresses, at the cost of the “feel” of your keys (the press feels a little squish at the bottom due to the ring being compressed rather than hitting whatever bottom it normally does).</p>
                <h3 id="key-switches">   Key switches <a href="#key-switches">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>Key Switches are the mechanical components which are responsible for “actuation”, in other words registering a key press.</p>

<p>There are a few general properties that can be used to categorize switches:</p>
                <h4 id="clicky-or-silent">   Clicky or silent <a href="#clicky-or-silent">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>If the switch is clicky, then the actuation includes a purposeful “click” sound. The click is actually not necessary to register the key press.</p>
                <h4 id="tactile-or-linear">   Tactile or linear <a href="#tactile-or-linear">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>For silent switches, tactile switches include physical feedback when the key is actuated. You feel a little resistance, and once that gives way you know you’ve pressed the button.</p>

<p>With a linear switch, the resistance is the same all the way through, which doesn’t give you a way to physically determine when the press was made.</p>
                <h4 id="travel-distance">   Travel distance <a href="#travel-distance">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The distance the switch travels between pressed and unpressed. Typically a few millimeters.</p>
                <h4 id="actuation-force">   Actuation force <a href="#actuation-force">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The total amount of force that must be applied to actuate the switch. The key will feel harder to press if the actuation force is higher.</p>
                <h4 id="my-conclusion-on-switches">   My Conclusion on Switches <a href="#my-conclusion-on-switches">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>I chose a switch with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest possible actuation force and travel distance. I tend to hit keys quite hard, and to minimize sound I need to try to actuate the key, but not actually “bottom out” and have my switch hit the bottom.</li>
  <li>Silent and linear attributes. Silent since the whole goal is to not make sound, and I found through testing that silent tactile switches result in additional noise when you hit the tactile feedback. The linear has no such noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the switch brand themselves, I found that Cherry MX, Gateron, and Kailh brand switches made roughly the same amount of noise. However, the <a href="https://zealpc.net/products/healio">ZealPC Healios</a> were orders of magnitude quieter in my HotDox. I’m not sure on exactly why, but it was impressive. Combined with the fact that they were linear switches, the Healios were the winner.</p>
                <h3 id="keyboard-housing">   Keyboard housing <a href="#keyboard-housing">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>The keyboard housing played a big part, based on my experiments (details below).</p>

<p>Housings that had less air inside produced less noise, since there wasn’t space for reverberation and the force of the keypress was more dampened by the material the keybaord was on.</p>

<p>Based on reviews, I read that the <a href="https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/">Hot Dox</a> keyboard was very silent (acrylic case with very little empty space inside). To further reduce any chance of reverberation, I added some <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-foam/products/kbdfans-module-foam">EVA foam</a> to fill the space between the PCB and the metallic cover on top.</p>

<p>There is also a material called <a href="https://www.sorbothane.com/">Sorbothane</a> that dampens things even better than foam, but I didn’t go that route because it would require hand-cutting it, and the material is hard to cut. If I tried to cut it without special equipment, I would probably end up with a rather uneven and unpleasent look.</p>
                <h3 id="material-keyboard-is-on">   Material keyboard is on <a href="#material-keyboard-is-on">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>I also found that the material the keyboard is on made a difference, although of a couple decibels. Typing on hard wood was louder. I read that using a keyboard / mousepad mat and putting your keyboard on top helps, so I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CP231W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">a cheap one on Amazon</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="experiments-with-different-scenarios">   Experiments with different scenarios <a href="#experiments-with-different-scenarios">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>To verify what I read, I tried to take some measurements with the loudness of various keyboards and configurations.</p>

<p>Although I originally tried to test the various scenarios with a decibel app on my phone, I found that the sensitivity wasn’t good enough to capture even relative differences between the different configurations. So I purchased a real decibel meter.</p>

<p>To measure the volume, I hovered the decibel meter about 3cm directly above the key being pressed. I pressed with the same rhythm, setting the decibel to “max” setting to capture the loudest the keypress ever is.</p>

<p>All experiments were with PBT Keycaps.</p>

<p>I started with a keyboard that was very loud (72.9 decibels), and was able to finish with a setup that was roughly 20dB quieter! Although the real noise reduction may be lower due to the microphone being more than 3cm away from the keyboard, the relative comparison is going from a noisy restaurant (70db) to a quiet office (50db).</p>

However, with the development of technology, the support has included more and more new functions, and its importance has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the development of IT support. In this article, we will figure out why IT support is important for business, why its quality directly affects the company’s profits, and what the prospects for this area are.</span></p>
<h2><span>The historical value of IT support</span></h2>
<p><span>The responsibilities of this service have grown in number steadily as technology, methodologies, and customer relationships have evolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the main functions of the IT help desk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>technical support for the company’s employees;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>support of external clients – users of the company’s products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and its applications/products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>control over the execution of requests at the agreed service levels;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Call Center/Help Desk;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>work with the Service Desk system;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>filling the knowledge base;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>monitoring the quality of the company’s IT services;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>communication with clients, employees, contractors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this is without a lot of smaller tasks that differ depending on the specifics of a company. Most of them are hidden from prying eyes like the underwater part of an iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the deepness of modern IT support, there is an opinion that this support for both employees and customers does not have an essential impact on the financial performance of the company. This point of view has been formed over decades, so no wonder that changing it is very difficult. But the world does not stand still, and changes have affected this function of the business as well.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the support service that is often the first point of contact between customers and a company, and it has great potential to take their relationship to the next level. Modern IT support specialists are no longer bearded geeks in sweaters who speak incomprehensible tech jargon.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, a qualified IT support specialist is a person with a high level of sociability and empathy, as well as teamwork and problem-solving skills. Such a specialist is constantly evolving and puts the needs of the client first. And they can give the business something more than solving clients’ problems and advising them.</span></p>
<h2><span>COVID-19: a tragedy or a chance?</span></h2>
<p><span>The coronavirus pandemic directly affected the development of IT support services, just as it affected all businesses across the world. From the digital transformation era perspective, these changes present a tremendous opportunity for CEOs around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the global development of digital processes. Companies that managed to implement digital solutions in time have already seen practical benefits for their businesses. Those that hadn’t, realized their oversight with the beginning of the transition of the whole world to remote work. There is no doubt that the trend will not decline but, vice versa, only grow in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up new opportunities and forces businesses to be more flexible, including in IT processes. In addition, the massive transfer of IT teams around the world to remote work has opened the eyes of companies to the effectiveness of remote support. More and more companies are announcing their plans to work in this mode at least for the whole of 2020, and some are organizing this process on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The work of IT support is going to a new level and increasing the value of the outsourcing format. Outsourcing companies often have a higher level of process maturity and a larger pool of resources than internal IT teams. Moreover, outsourcing services also actively introduce new digital approaches and change their models in accordance with modern customer requirements. Their flexibility is now extremely high, and the benefits of using their services are maximized.</span></p>
<p><span>These companies operate at agreed levels of service, so the client can be confident in the quality of service they will receive and how much it will cost. Both </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/trending-topics/coronavirus-impact"><span>Gartner</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/digital-transformation/articles/delivering-customer-service-during-COVID-19.html"><span>Deloitte</span></a><span> are reporting the increased value of outsourcing services during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many examples of successful transfer of customer service to outsourcing companies, including by such well-known entities as Microsoft, Dell, Ford Motor Company, CISCO, General Electric, American Express. Cost reduction remains one of the major reasons for such transfers, but </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/global-outsourcing-survey.html"><span>Deloitte research shows</span></a><span> that modern companies are concentrating more on the overall value they can get from the outsourcing services instead of just cost savings.</span></p>
<h2><span>The digital future of IT support services</span></h2>
<p><span>Digital transformation is primarily perceived as the introduction of new technologies and communication channels in the work with clients. More and more companies are implementing chatbots, virtual assistants, notifications via messengers, polls via social networks, etc. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data are also increasingly used to create additional customer benefits in IT services.</span></p>
<p><span>But even this is not enough to get the maximum benefits of the current period of digital transformation. Now the most important thing is to change how the operating model of IT support works with clients. All operational processes need to be improved to meet the new service requirements that are put forward by today’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>IT support teams should reorient from their usual performance indicators to those that are more important for the business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Net Promoter Score</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Lifetime Value</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The new benchmarks for the IT support function should be aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating additional benefits for them. And IT support team leaders should reconsider processes much more often. This will ensure that the quality of their teams’ work meets the current requirements of clients.</span></p>
<p><b>Additional features of the support service that add value to your business:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Analyzing customer needs and behaviors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Identifying key touchpoints of customers</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing customers’ loyalty through a personalized experience</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Demonstrating to customers how they can get the best from the new digital solutions</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Providing fast feedback about the efficiency of new methods and technologies</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes it obvious that there is a need for urgent changes in the operational approaches of IT support for every company that wants to achieve maximum success in working with clients. The old approaches are hopelessly outdated, and the competition is higher than ever before. At the same time, the scale of the ongoing digital changes is enormous and brings many benefits to the business.</span></p>
<p><span>Those companies that adapt to the demands of the new era faster than others will be the first to maximize their competitive advantages. And clients, for their part, will tend to work with those companies that are actively implementing digital solutions in their work for the sake of the clients’ convenience. This is a win-win situation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>The transformation has already affected all aspects of the business: sales, marketing, development, and so on. But the support service has one big advantage over all others: it historically has the maximum flexibility necessary to work effectively with customers. In a fast-paced world, support teams who work directly with customers on a daily basis are used to changing their approaches and tools as soon as required.</span></p>
<p><span>Since customers now more than ever dictate to companies the level of service they receive, the willingness of organizations to respond quickly to these requirements plays center stage. And here, the flexibility of customer service specialists and their developed software skills will be more useful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The determination to act and change is needed for one more reason. Digital transformation is not the last of the key trends affecting the business environment. It will be followed by other trends, also critical for business development. The sooner companies start implementing technological innovations, the sooner they will have the opportunity to be among the leaders in their field.</span></p>
<p><span>This mindset is now more important than ever for leaders who determine the strategy for support services for the coming months and years. Today, clients are very demanding and highly value quality service. The opportunities that have opened up for companies in the current era of digital transformation may be exactly the accelerator that many of them dream of. The only question is who is ready to change quickly for the benefit of clients and for the sake of their future – in practice, not just in words.</span></p>

When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>

I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

Despite living in Switzerland, since I am Portuguese, I usually fly with <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> at least to go home.</p><p>When I visit TAP's website, I am presented with a website in German. This is normal. Switzerland is a country with four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. The most common one is German, so it stands to reason that most websites targeted at (or from) Switzerland present themselves in German on your first visit when they see you are coming from Switzerland.</p><p>Sadly, I don't know German (yet), so every time I enter a website in German, I start looking for the language picker so I can change the language to one that I might understand. Once I do this on TAP's website, I can finally get down to business and buy my tickets and when I do, I'm happy and leave the website thinking about the beaches and the sand waiting for me.</p><p>Sadly, five minutes later, I'm not that happy anymore because I just realized that I needed to travel with a check-in luggage that I forgot to add. No worries, I go back to <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> to fix the issue, but I'm greeted again with a website in German?!?</p><hr><p>This situation is common: you visit a website, you change the language to one you understand. Once you get what you need, you leave. The next time you come back, the website is once again in a language you do not understand instead of the one you picked on your last visit.</p><p>Some will say that this is nothing. In fact, it is nothing. A nothing that can be fixed in a couple of clicks. A nothing without any real impact. It is true but it is a nothing that happens every day, multiple times per day.</p><blockquote><p>Every time this happens it's something small, like a drop of water... but after a while, your cup will probably be full.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> is a single example out of hundreds, probably thousands. Go ahead, try this at <a href="https://www.comparis.ch/">comparis</a> or even <a href="https://www.migros.ch/">migros</a>. Look for other Swiss websites but don't forget to close the page after picking the language and re-opening it to check what language you will be presented with. If you read until now, you already know the result.</p><h2>We as web developers</h2><p>As a web developer, this makes me mad. Why is the user presented with a default language he does not understand, if he already chose his preference before? If you have a good reason I'd really like to know. If not, can we do better? After all, Switzerland is mostly German but not only.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A guide to event handling in Elixir]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  <p>Using events is a common way of integrating different parts of a modular system. But while the concept is easy to grasp, the implementation can be tricker.</p>

<p>Integrating subsystems is hard, and there are always trade-offs. Events are not different.</p>

<p>There are many possible ways of event handling. Choosing the wrong one for your needs can be a serious mistake.</p>

<p>This article shows you some of the choices available and trade-offs you have to consider with each of them. Some are related to Elixir itself, and some are technology-agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="1-synchronous-processing">1. Synchronous processing</h2>

<p>The simplest way to process events is to do this synchronously:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>\\</span> <span>[</span><span>Mailer</span><span>,</span> <span>Notifications</span><span>])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># You can wrap the entire function in a transaction</span>
    <span># to ensure strong consistency.</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>event_handler</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>event_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Synchronous processing has multiple benefits and <strong>it should probably be the first step</strong> (especially for existing applications) unless you need the benefits of asynchronous processing.</p>

<p>If you’re running a modular monolith with a single database, you can even use a database transaction to guarantee strong consistency between the data and the event.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/synchronous.png" alt="synchronous processing"></p>

<p>That way, you can start decoupling your contexts logically (see: <a href="https://mkaszubowski.com/2019/06/28/events-and-different-kinds-of-coupling.html">Events and different kinds of coupling</a>) without dealing with the technical challenges of asynchronous code and eventual consistency.</p>

<p>The trade-off is that synchronous processing and/or a transaction means <strong><em>all or nothing</em> semantics</strong>. Either everything works correctly, or nothing is saved.</p>

<p><em>All or nothing</em> makes the code more predictable and easier to debug, but it’s not always desirable. When it’s an issue? When the customer places an order, you probably want that information saved even if there’s a temporary bug in the code handling that shipping.</p>

<p>When to consider synchronous event processing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have little experience with events.</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to introduce additional technical complexity and infrastructure costs.</li>
  <li>In a monolith system, which you’d like to make more modular.</li>
  <li>As a replacement for other mechanisms in the test environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is synchronous processing <strong>not</strong> a good idea?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you need to isolate failures.</li>
  <li>When quick response is crucial (and you know what you’re doing).</li>
  <li>For long-running, asynchronous, or third-party side effects. If side effects are out of your control, it might be a better idea to handle them in a proper asynchronous fashion.</li>
  <li>When side-effects can be delayed or batched in the background for better performance.</li>
  <li>When you’re communicating across different services (in other words - in a distributed system).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-process-based-pubsub">2. Process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Since processes and message passing are basic building blocks in Elixir, we can use an in-memory PubSub mechanism (for example <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html#module-using-as-a-pubsub">Registry</a> or <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html#direct_broadcast/5">Phoenix PubSub for a single node</a>) to broadcast events to subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/pubsub.png" alt="in-memory PubSub"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Subscriber</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>GenServer</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>start_link</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>name:</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>([])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span>(</span><span>"user_sign_ups"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>())</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{}}</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>handle_info</span><span>(%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mailer</span><span>.</span><span>send_welcome_email</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Such in-memory PubSub offers at-most-once delivery semantics</strong>. That means that the message will either be received once or won’t be delivered at all.</p>

<p>At-most-once delivery means that if we handle side effects or events using an in-memory PubSub mechanism, <strong>the side effects are not guaranteed to be executed:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a subscriber exits before the message is received, it won’t receive the message again.</li>
  <li>If a subscriber crashes when processing the side effect, it won’t try to process it again after restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This approach should only be used if losing some messages is OK</strong>. Some common examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-app notifications.</li>
  <li>Transient application state (e.g. cache).</li>
  <li>Things that can be corrected by next messages or a periodic job.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Be careful when sending in-memory messages from within a DB transaction: </p><p> 
1) The transaction can be rolled back after a message has been sent. <br>
2) It can lead to hard-to-debug errors when a subscriber receives the message and tries to read the data before a transaction has been committed.</p></div>

<h2 id="3-multi-node-process-based-pubsub">3. Multi-node, process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Multi-node PubSub (like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html">Phoenix PubSub</a>) allows you to broadcast messages to subscribers on multiple nodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/multi-node.png" alt="multi-node in-memory PubSub"></p>

<p>Multi-node PubSub is usually useful for stateful processing when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to synchronize state across multiple nodes (e.g. distributed cache).</li>
  <li>You have clients with long-running connections (WebSocket, long-poll, …) - that’s why Phoenix Channels and LiveView use a multi-node Phoenix.PubSub).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with a single-node PubSub, message delivery is not guaranteed. Use this solution only if losing some messages is fine</p>

<p>With multi-node PubSub, you have to remember to make sure that the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">nodes are connected to form a cluster</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-same-database-for-events--smart-consumer-with-polling">4. Same database for events + smart consumer with polling</h2>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/polling.png" alt="polling for events"></p>

<p>If you need every event to be processed in an async environment, you need some kind of persistent storage.</p>

<p>The first and simplest option is to use a single database for data and events. Then, you can have multiple subscribers fetching the data and processing the events asynchronously.</p>

<p>Benefits of this approach include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low operational cost - you don’t need to add any additional infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The same database for data and events means it’s easier to maintain consistency since you can save events in a transaction. There’s no chance of “orphaned” events and no risk of not saving an event when something happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to scale for multiple services because of the coupling to the same DB.</li>
  <li>Harder to scale if the data exceeds a single DB.</li>
  <li>Each subscriber has to implement the logic to fetch the events, keep track of which events it’d already processed, and handle deduplication of events. This can be a lot of repetitive work for a larger system.</li>
  <li>Polling for events in a loop can have higher latency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-use-listennotify">Alternative: Use Listen/Notify</h3>

<p>You can modify the following approach to limit the number of queries done by polling the DB for new events. <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/listen-and-notify-postgresql-commands-in-elixir-187c49597851">If you use PostgreSQL, you can use Listen/Notify</a> to notify subscribers of new events. This way, you only have to ask the DB once (at startup) for the events missed by the subscriber:</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/listen-notify.png" alt="listen-notify"></p>

<h2 id="5-events-in-separate-dbmessage-queue">5. Events in separate DB/message queue</h2>

<p>Once you use a lot of events, or you have multiple services, you will probably use a separate message queue for events. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>Amazon SQA</li>
  <li>Google Cloud PubSub</li>
  <li>Kafka</li>
  <li>EventStore</li>
</ul>

<p>(While there are many differences between them, it’s way out of the scope of this article to describe them.)</p>

<p>The major drawback of this solution is that you can no longer rely on DB transactions to maintain consistency between your data and the events.</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s no guarantee that the user and the event will be saved atomically.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/timeline.png" alt="timeline of function calls"></p>

<p>If anything goes wrong before those two function calls (or the second one fails), the event is gone forever.</p>

<p>One way of dealing with this is to <strong>treat events as a source of truth.</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/cqrs.png" alt="cqrs"></p>

<p>You might have heard about this pattern as <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</strong> The biggest challenge with this approach is that we’re now in the realm of <strong>eventual consistency.</strong> The user will eventually be saved in the database, but there’s some unknown delay. CQRS and eventual consistency make the code more complicated at the cost of lower operational coupling.</p>

<p>The important conclusion is that everything is a trade-off and there’s a price to pay for everything. You might lower the operational coupling by introducing a separate message queue, but the price for that is more complicated code and higher operations and infrastructure cost.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-outbox-pattern">6. The outbox pattern</h2>

<p>You can use the outbox pattern when you use events for integration and not as a source of truth, but you cannot lose any events.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/outbox.png" alt="outbox pattern"></p>

<p>The Outbox pattern relies on having an outbox table in the same database as the data. We use a DB transaction to atomically save the data (the user) and the event. A separate process reads the outbox table in the background, publishes the events to the external message queue, and deletes the events from the outbox.</p>

<p>Outbox pattern guarantees that <strong>each event will be published at least once</strong>, which means that we still have to make sure we can handle duplicated events (but this is a good practice anyway since most message queues have at-least-once delivery semantics).</p>

<h2 id="performance-warning">Performance warning</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to use asynchronous processing to make the system “faster” by doing some of the work after returning a response to the client. Unless you know what you’re doing, <strong>don’t do that.</strong></p>

<p>Doing work in the background doesn’t make it faster. It only hides the work from the client.</p>

<p>Synchronous calls serve as automatic <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Back-Pressure">back pressure</a>. Since the clients wait for the response before making new requests, the server does only as much as it can handle. As the workload increases, so do the response times - which means that each client sends requests at a lower frequency.</p>

<p>Synchronous processing allows your system to slow down gracefully without collapsing. The system slows down, but it doesn’t crash.</p>

<p>If you do some work in the background, the clients can start sending the next requests much …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a> is a yearly event offered by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric Wastl</a>: every day before Christmas, you can unlock <strong>a<strong> daily code challenge</strong></strong> and crack it with the programming language of your choice.</p><p>It's super funny, with a pleasant Xmas/elve/reindeer... background and a soft difficulty curve (anyone with some programming experience can take the first challenges).</p><p>This year was my second participation. For the first time I was able to go through all the 25 challenges (it took me a bit more than 25 days) and the only language I used was Elixir.</p><p>I will now share with you my <strong><strong>Advent Of code takeaways</strong></strong>.</p><h2 id="1-you-re-not-an-impostor-"><strong>1 - You're not an impostor 🥸</strong></h2><p>Advent Of code is for anyone willing to improve their programming skills.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you are:</p><ul><li>a competitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">golf programmer</a> used to crack challenges in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/day/25">less than 5 minutes</a> to rank among the first 🤯</li><li>a student or just some folk learning programming</li><li>a seasoned programmer willing to crank up his skills ( 👈 I'm here )</li><li>a seasoned programmer learning a new language (I might do next season's AOC in Rust)</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/jim-carrey-2.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Cranking up my typing skills</figcaption></figure><p>What relieved me the most was how welcoming and helpful the AOC community is. A new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads">Reddit thread</a> is opened every day and people are encouraged to share their solutions or ask for help.</p><h2 id="2-cs101-again-"><strong>2 - CS101 ... again 👨‍🎓</strong></h2><p>If like me you graduated computer science quite a while ago, AOC might be the perfect occasion to refresh your academic knowledge.</p><p>Advent of Code will make you think about:</p><ul><li><strong>A<strong>lgorithmic complexity</strong></strong>, also known as <em><em>"</em>WTF<em> </em>why is <em>my code running for 30</em> <em>minutes and not yielding any result ?!?"</em></em></li><li><strong>D<strong>ata structures</strong>.</strong> Some challenges are tough without proper data modeling. So I suggest you know the ins and outs of basic data structures (chained lists, trees, and graphs) and related algorithms (depth-first vs breadth-first tree traversal)</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">Formal Grammar</a></strong> will help you with some challenge</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">D<strong>ynamic programming</strong></a></strong> also saved me an evening of hacking.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg" alt="infinite loop" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2021/01/infinite-loop.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryJGrady">Grady</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-coding-kata-"><strong>3 - Coding Kata 🥋</strong></h2><p>We are no machines and we are not required to know anything by heart: so much knowledge is reachable online, within a few seconds.</p><p>Still, knowing a few will help.</p><p>AOC helped me to muscle my memory, and I'm now able to code most challenges in a single streak without reaching the documentation or copy-pasting from previous code. During this event, I reinforced my knowledge of some of the most important Elixir APIs (<code>Enum</code>, <code>Stream</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Regex</code>).</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eiLJO8oDuWtU1xd5oc/giphy.gif" alt="Cobra Kai"><figcaption>Code Editor is your Dojo</figcaption></figure><p>By not abusing <em><em>alt-tab</em></em> and staying focused in your code editor you'll be able to reach what most athletes know as <strong><strong>flow state</strong></strong>: this mental state in which you feel the most enjoyed and productive.</p><p>Like athletes, everyday practice will give you reflex, confidence, and improve your judgment.</p><h2 id="4-and-a-few-elixir-lessons-"><strong>4 - And a few Elixir lessons 🧪</strong></h2><p>Reddit hosts the biggest AOC community, but you can also look after smaller AOC sub-communities. I learned much from ad-hoc threads created on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/tag/advent-of-code">Elixir Forum</a>.</p><p>Here are a few things I learned, mostly from reading at other's solutions:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://elixirforum.com/tag/advent-of-code">Elixir comprehensions</a> are powerful</strong>. They let you iterate, combine, filter and reduce in few line of codes (I recommend you <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/best-practices-of-comprehensions-in-elixir-310ae3167bd2">this article</a>)</li><li><strong><strong>Prepending is not appending</strong> - <strong>Elixir lists are not arrays</strong></strong>. Those assumptions sound trivial but helped me make a 60 seconds program run within a few milliseconds. Elixir is immutable and as such if you want to append a single item to a list, Elixir will create a whole new copy of the list (Elixir can't modify the last item to point at your new item - immutable we said ;-). On the opposite, prepending to a list will only create a new item that will point to the previous untouched list. That's why Elixir gives us a powerful prepend operator <code>prepended_list = [item | list]</code></li><li><strong>Elixir most common APIs hide a few jewels</strong> that I never used in 4 years of Elixir Programming. With AOC I discovered <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_every/4">Enum.chunk_every</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_while/4">Enum.chunk_while</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#zip/1">Enum.zip</a></code> or <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#unfold/2">Stream.unfold</a></code></li><li>You have all <strong><strong>Erlang magic at hand</strong></strong>. I solved some of the challenges by using raw Erlang APIs such as <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code>, <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/digraph.html">digraph</a></code>, or the fairly new <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> module.</li><li><strong>Immutability brings safety</strong>. Some challenges were tricky to code in some other languages because if you didn't take care of doing deep copies of your data structure you ran into an inconsistent state. In Elixir, there is no such thing as shared mutable state, so deep copy comes for free 😎</li><li><strong>Immutability is slower. </strong>The cost of safety is that any write operation in Elixir will be slower than in any other languages with mutable data structures. <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code> or <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> Erlang APIs can sometimes be handy.</li></ul><h2 id="final-words"><strong><strong>Final words</strong></strong></h2><p>If you didn't know Advent Of Code before or just never tried, I hope this post will convince you to give a shot at it. AOC is not timebound and you can follow any event whenever you want at your own pace.</p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention that AOC is also a bit addictive and I may have started over from year 2015 🙊 😁 🎄</p>

<h2 id="bastille-default-templates">Bastille Default Templates</h2>
<p>Beginning with Bastille 0.8.20210101 the <code>Bastillefile</code> format is now standard
and the template system is fully native. This means that Bastille will use
default templates to apply base configuration of all new containers.</p>
<p>These default templates can also be customized or extended to meet your
specific needs.</p>
<p>In this post I will outline the Bastille template system and how it is used to
configure all new containers.</p>
<h3 id="template-overview">Template Overview</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are simple text files defining the automation needed to
configure a container. These templates can range from simple to complex. To see
a list of available templates visit <a href="https://gitlab.com/bastillebsd-templates/">BastilleBSD
Templates</a></p>
<h3 id="bastillefile">Bastillefile</h3>
<p>A <code>Bastillefile</code> is the “script” that is executed when a template is applied.
Each template will have a unique <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p>These files can also <code>INCLUDE</code> other Bastillefiles. This allows you to keep the
files relatively simple and organize logical components into separate
templates.</p>
<p>The <code>Bastillefile</code> template syntax follows a simple format of a Bastille
sub-command followed by its arguments. Inside a <code>Bastillefile</code> you do not need
to specify a TARGET. The target is defined when applying the template.</p>
<p>Given these simple requirements you can execute any Bastille sub-command in any
order by defining them <em>one per line</em> in the <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Bastillefile Example: nginx</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
SYSRC nginx_enable=YES
SERVICE nginx start
RDR 443 443
</code></pre><p>This <code>Bastillefile</code> would perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>nginx</code> binary package inside the container.</li>
<li>Recursively copy <code>usr</code> from the template directory into container / path.</li>
<li>Enable the nginx service at container startup.</li>
<li>Start the nginx service in the running container.</li>
<li>Redirect port 443 traffic from host into container.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the required nginx configuration files were included in the <code>usr</code>
directory (overlay), that container is now configured, enabled, running and
accepting traffic.</p>
<p>The “UPPERCASE lowercase” format is a simple visual representation of the
sub-command (UPPERCASE) and the arguments to that sub-command (lowercase).</p>
<p>Any Bastille sub-command that targets a container can be used within a
<code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<h3 id="default-templates">Default Templates</h3>
<p>As of version 0.8.20210101 Bastille ships with a handful of “default”
templates. These are used to apply any default configuration to newly created
containers. These “default” templates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>base</li>
<li>empty</li>
<li>thick</li>
<li>thin</li>
<li>vnet</li>
</ul>
<p>These default templates are defined in the <code>bastille.conf</code> like so:</p>
<p><strong>bastille.conf</strong></p>
<pre><code>+## Default Templates
+bastille_template_base="default/base"      ## default: "default/base"
+bastille_template_empty="default/empty"    ## default: "default/empty"
+bastille_template_thick="default/thick"    ## default: "default/thick"
+bastille_template_thin="default/thin"      ## default: "default/thin"
+bastille_template_vnet="default/vnet"      ## default: "default/vnet"
</code></pre><p><strong>If upgrading from a previous release be sure these lines have been merged
into your bastille.conf</strong></p>
<p>These templates are included in the installation at
<code>/usr/local/share/bastille/templates/default</code>.</p>
<p>The default <code>base</code> template is applied to all new containers. This base
template is applied by way of an <code>INCLUDE</code> statement within the other
templates.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Below is a copy of these five default templates for reference.</p>
<p><strong>default/base</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

CMD touch /etc/rc.conf
SYSRC syslogd_flags="-ss"
SYSRC sendmail_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
SYSRC cron_flags="-J 60"

CP "${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}" /etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thin</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thick</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/vnet</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

ARG EPAIR
ARG GATEWAY
ARG IFCONFIG="SYNCDHCP"

SYSRC ifconfig_${EPAIR}_name=vnet0
SYSRC ifconfig_vnet0="${IFCONFIG}"
# GATEWAY will be empty for a DHCP config. -- cwells
CMD if [ -n "${GATEWAY}" ]; then /usr/sbin/sysrc defaultrouter="${GATEWAY}"; fi
</code></pre><p><strong>default/empty</strong></p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>As the name implies this is an empty container. No custom configuration
is defined.</p>
<h3 id="template-arg">Template ARG</h3>
<p>The keen observer will notice many of the default templates use the keyword
<code>ARG</code> to define variables. In this case:</p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>These variables can be referenced later in the template:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p>The above example variables would translate into:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>Additionally you can define and later <code>RENDER</code> these custom variables inside
configuration files.</p>
<p>Tip: The variables <code>${JAIL_NAME}</code> and <code>${JAIL_IP}</code> are automatically included
and can be used within container configuration files.</p>
<p><strong>Example: RENDER file</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>Example: RENDER directory (recursive)</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/www
...
</code></pre><h3 id="customizing-default-templates">Customizing Default Templates</h3>
<p>As you can see from the included default template examples, most configuration
is done in the <code>default/base</code> template and the other templates <code>INCLUDE</code> that
and (optionally) extend with additional changes.</p>
<p>The best way to customize the default templates is to extend them in your own
custom template. These custom templates can then be configured as the defaults
for your environment by updating the <code>bastille.conf</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In order to avoid having your changes clobbered with a Bastille package
update it is not recommended to edit the default template(s) themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Create a new template namespace at <code>/usr/local/bastille/templates/</code>. This
new template namespace is often a username or team/project name. Within this
namespace you can create new templates and extend the defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Example for admin: cedwards</strong></p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/bastille/templates/cedwards/base 
</code></pre><p>From here we can extend the <code>default/base</code> template with our own template.</p>
<p>Included below is an example <code>Bastillefile</code> that enables outbound sendmail.</p>
<p><strong>cedwards/base/Bastillefile</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="YES"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="YES"
</code></pre><p>Update the <code>bastille.conf</code> to use <code>cedwards/base</code> as the new default:</p>
<pre><code>bastille_template_base="cedwards/base"      ## default: "default/base"
</code></pre><p>With this configuration every new container would have <code>default/base</code> applied
(due to the <code>INCLUDE</code> from <code>cedwards/base</code>) followed by the additional
configuration in the <code>cedwards/base</code> template.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are a simple and effective way to automate container
creation and management. Who knew automated configuration management could be
so simple?</p>
<p>Customizing a default template <code>Bastillefile</code> will allow you to change the way
every new system is configured. These defaults can be set for each main
container type and can be extended using any Bastille sub-command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I wrote a post at the start of last year thinking about <a href="http://www.erisian.com.au/wordpress/2020/01/07/bitcoiner-maximalism">my general priorities for Bitcoin</a> and I’m still pretty happy with that approach — certainly <em><strong>“store of value” as a foundation</strong></em> feels like it’s held up!</p>



<p>I think over the past year we’ve seen a lot of people starting to hold a Bitcoin balance, and that we’ll continue to do so — which is a win, but following last year’s logic also means we’ll want to start paying more attention to the later parts of the funnel as well: if we (for instance) double the number of people holding Bitcoin, we also want to double the number of people doing self-custody, and double the number of people transacting over lightning, eg; and ideally we’d want that in addition to whatever growth in self-custody and layer 2 transactions we’d already been aiming for if Bitcoin adoption had remained flat.</p>



<p>That said, I’m not sure I’m in a growth mindset for Bitcoin this year, rather than a consolidation one: consider the BTC price at the start of the past few years: 2016: ~$450, 2017: $1000, 2018: $13,000, 2019: $3700, 2020: $8000, 2021: $30,000. Has there been a 8x increase in security and robustness during 2016, 2017 and 2018 to match the 8x price increase from Jan 2016 to Jan 2019? Yeah, that’s probably fair. Has there been another 8x increase in security and robustness during 2019 and 2020 to match the 8x price increase there? Maybe. What if you’re thinking of a price target of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hitting-200k-by-december-2021-is-now-conservative-willy-woo">$200,000</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionusd/status/1343140448160915457">$300,000</a> sometime soon — doesn’t that require yet another 8x increase in security and robustness? Where’s that going to come from? And those 8x factors are multiplicative: if you want something like $250k by December 2021, that’s not a “three-eights-are-24” times increase in robustness over six years (2016 to 2022), it’s an “<strong>eight-cubed-is-512</strong>” times increase in robustness! And your mileage may vary, but I don’t really think Bitcoin’s already 500x more robust than it was five years ago.</p>



<p>So as excited as I am about taproot and the possibilities that opens up (PTLCs and eventually eltoo on lightning, scriptless scripts and discreet log contracts, privacy preserving proof of reserves, cheap multisig — the list might not be infinite but at least seems computationally intractable), I think I’m now even more of the view that <em><strong>it’s probably more important to work on things that reinforce the existing foundations, than neat new ideas to change them</strong></em> than I was this time last year.</p>



<p>There are already a bunch of areas where Bitcoin’s approach to security and robustness has improved technically over the past few years: we’ve got more people doing reviews (eg, via the PR review club, or getting introduced to Bitcoin via the Chaincode Residency etc), we’ve got deeper and more diverse continuous integration testing (thanks both to more integrations being enabled via github, and travis becoming unreliable enough to force looking at other approaches), fuzz testing has improved a lot and become a bit more broadly used, and I think static analysis of the codebase has improved a bit. There have been a bunch of improvements in code standards (eg using safe pointers, locking annotations, spans instead of raw pointers) too, I think it’s fair to say. I haven’t done an analysis here, just going from gut feel and recollection.</p>



<p>With a focus on robustness, to me, the areas to prioritise in the short term are probably:</p>



<ol><li>Modularisation — eg, so that we can better leverage process separation to reduce security impacts, and better use fuzz testing to catch bugs in edge cases. There’s already work to split the gui and wallet into separate processes, though while that’s merged, it’s not part of the standard build yet. Having the p2p-network-facing layer also be a separate process might be another good win. While it’s a tempting goal, I think libconsensus is still a ways off — p2p, mempool management, and validation rules are currently pretty tightly coupled — but there’s steps we can make towards that goal that will be improvements on their own, I think.</li><li>The P2P network — This is the obvious way to attack Bitcoin since by its nature everyone has access to it. There are multiple levels to this: passively monitoring the p2p network may allow you to violate users’ privacy expectations, while actively isolating users onto independent networks can break Bitcoin’s fundamental assumptions (you can’t extend the longest chain if you can’t communicate with any of the people who have the longest chain). There are also plenty of potential problems that someone could cause in between those extremes that could, eg, break assumptions that L2 systems like lightning make. Third-party (potentially centralised) alternatives as backups for the p2p network may also be valuable support here — things like Blockstream Satellite, or block relay over ham radio, or headers over DNS: those can mend splits in the p2p network that the p2p layer itself can’t automatically fix. Or efficiency improvements like erlay or block-relay-only can allow a higher degree of connectivity making attacks harder.</li><li>CI, static analysis, reproducible builds — Over the past year, travis seems like it’s gone from having the occasional annoying problem to being <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works">pretty much unusable</a> for open source projects. CI is an important part of both development and review; having it break makes both quite a lot harder. What we’ve got at this point seems pretty good, but it’s new and not really time-tested yet, so I’d guess a year of smoothing out the rough edges is probably needed. I think there’s other “CI”-ish stuff that could be improved, like more automated IBD testing (eg, I think <a href="https://bitcoinperf.com/d/YiV16Vsik/overview?orgId=1&amp;from=now-6M&amp;to=now">bitcoinperf</a> is about 3 months out of date). Static analysis serves a similar goal to tests in a different way; and while we’ve already got a lot of low hanging fruit of this nature already integrated into CI via linters and compiler options, I suspect there’s still some useful automation that could happen here. Finally, nailing down the last mile to ensure that people are running the software the devs are testing is always valuable, and I think the nixos work is showing some promise there.</li><li>Third-party validation — We’ve had a few third-party monitoring tools arise lately — various sites monitoring feerate and mempool sizes, forkmonitor checking for stale blocks (and double-spends), or, at a stretch, optech’s reviews of wallet behaviour and segwit support. There’s probably a lot of room for more of this.</li></ol>



<p>I’d love to list formal verification at the consensus layer as a priority, but I think there’s too much yak-shaving needed first: it would probably need all the refactoring to get to libconsensus first, then would likely need that separated into its own process, which you could only then start defining a formal spec for, which in turn would give you something you could start doing formal verification against. I suspect we’ll want to be at that point within another cycle or two though.</p>



<p>I’m not concerned about mining — eventually there might be a risk that the subsidy is too small and there’s not enough fee income, but that’s not going to happen while the price doubles faster than the pre-scheduled halvings. There’s certainly centralisation risks, whether in ASIC manufacture, in hardware ownership/control, or at the pool level, but my sense of things is that’s not getting worse, and is not the biggest immediate risk. Maybe I’m wrong; if so, hopefully the people who think so are working on preventing problems from arising, rather than taking advantage of them.</p>



<p>There are other levels of robustness and security beyond just “keep the network working”, if you consider the question of “how to prevent my coins from being lost/stolen?” more broadly. The phishing attacks and potential for physical attacks resulting from the Ledger leak are an easy example of a problem of this sort, but exchange hacks/failures in general, malware swapping addresses so your funds go to an attacker instead of the intended recipient, and lost access to keys are also pretty bad. I think descriptors, miniscript and taproot multisig probably provide for a good path forward to help prevent losing access to keys; and it’s possible that progress on BIP322 (signing messages against a Bitcoin address) may provide a path to avoiding address swapping attacks.</p>



<p>Technical solutions are, in some sense, all you can hope for if you’re doing self-custody; but where a bank/custodian is involved (good) regulation might be useful too: requirements to keep customer data protected or destroyed, third-party audits to ensure the best-practices procedures you’re claiming to follow are actually being followed, etc. If custodians store funds in taproot addresses, it may be feasible to do privacy preserving (zero-knowledge) <a href="https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833">proofs of solvency</a>, eg, making it harder for fly-by-night folks to run ponzi schemes or otherwise steal their customers’ funds.</p>



<p>Obviously where possible these sorts of standards should be implemented via audited open source code rather than needing extensive implementation costs by each company. But one other thing to think about is whether regulations of this nature could be setup as industry standards (“we comply with the industry standard, competitor X doesn’t”) rather than necessarily a government regulator — for one, it certainly seems questionable whether government regulators have the background to pick good best practices for cryptocurrency systems to follow. Though perhaps it would be to have something oriented towards “consumer rights” than “industry” per se, to avoid it just being a vector for regulatory capture.</p>



<p>I think there’s been good progress on stabilising Bitcoin development — in 2015 through 2017 we were in a phase where people were seriously thinking of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/according-viabtc-team-bitcoin-core-developers-fired/">replacing</a> <a href="https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7">Bitcoin’s</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2017-bitpay-ceo-bitcoin-fork">developers</a> — devs were opposing a quick blocksize increase, so the obvious solution was to replace them with people who weren’t opposed. If you think of Bitcoin as an experimental, payments-oriented, tech startup, that’s perhaps not …</p></div></div>

	<p><strong>FEROZ KHAN HAS</strong> spent his whole life in Dubai, and hadn’t ever considered leaving until last year. The IT professional, 37, worked for Emirates airline in aviation technology until August, when he was made redundant. He was there for 14 years.</p>
<p>Khan applied for dozens of technology and startup jobs in the weeks since, both in the UAE and around the world. He gave himself until the end of the year to find something else, or else he’s heading for Canada to do a master’s degree. He probably won’t come back.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly well networked here in the industry, but anyone I’ve asked has said they’ll have to wait until [2021] to hire,” he says. “The toughest part for me is that I was born here. This is home—I have never known anywhere else. Thirty seven years in this city and I’m now wondering if I made a huge mistake by getting too deeply attached here.”</p>
<p>Over the months, Khan has watched as friends in the industry, mostly programmers and IT professionals, have been made redundant or have moved home because their spouses have lost their jobs, or found the IT salaries aren’t what they used to be.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen people who’ve been here 40 years who say they can’t afford to live here anymore. I think they need to have a good look and see how the expat model is going to work. There are so many people leaving.”</p>
<p>As Covid-19 wreaks havoc on the job market in the Gulf, expats are returning home in unprecedented numbers. A report from Oxford Economics suggests the UAE alone could lose 10 percent of its population due to the impact of the pandemic, but some believe it could be more.</p>
<p>And while this expat exodus is happening across industries—there are multiple reports of blue-collar workers, many from South Asia, leaving—what for the tech industry, a sector that the UAE, and many of its neighbors, have staked their futures on?</p>
<p>As the industry hemorrhages foreign talent due to industry-wide layoffs, can it still experience the record-breaking growth that was expected?</p>
<p>Experts say it’s possible—but companies will have to think hard about how they lure people back as things calm down, or figure out how to leverage foreign expertise in a world more accepting of virtual workplaces.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Middle East and North Africa experienced a boom in tech activity. A record 564 startup investments were made in the region, accounting for $704 million in funding, according data platform Magnitt. Philip Bahoshy, the company’s chief executive, believes if it had not been for Covid-19, that number would have hit $1 billion in 2020. And it was certainly on track to do so: the average deal size in the first half of this year was $4.1 million, more than double the $1.9 million seen in 2019. Funding to June 2020 already accounted for 95 percent of that for the whole of 2019; Bahoshy believes, however, that this has now slowed significantly as investors, cautious of market volatility, put their money into more established, but far fewer, startups.</p>
<p>The UAE has spent years positioning itself as a regional haven for tech companies and startups, with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai governments pouring millions into incubators and accelerators to help tech entrepreneurs and savvy businesspeople bring their ideas to fruition. The country’s 50-year plan heavily relies on its development as a knowledge- and technology-based economy focused on developing entrepreneurial ventures. But that hasn’t saved even the biggest startup stars in the country from the pandemic, which has hit both revenues and workforces.</p>
<p>Ride-hailing firm Careem in May cut almost a third of its workforce, accounting for 536 jobs. Meanwhile Fetchr—once one of the rising stars of the Middle East’s burgeoning startup scene, valued at almost $300 million in a 2017 fundraising round—shed 1,230 jobs across its operations, although its troubles pre-date the pandemic, having found itself on the brink of collapse in late 2019. It has since raised new funding however, and made a push into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>But the list goes on. In late August, Dubai-based retail platform Awok closed only a year after raising $30 million in one of the largest investment rounds for an e-commerce startup in the region. According to its LinkedIn page, Awok employed 700 people.</p>
<p>With such a saturated market of technology professionals now out of work and many heading home, some worry for the future of the industry in the Gulf. However, Bahoshy says tech talent has “always been a challenge for startups in the region,” and redundancies are actually having some positive effects, with cases of out-of-work staff becoming entrepreneurs in their own right. “Having said that, the region continues to require experienced tech talent and now would be an opportune time to look beyond the region to attract individuals,” he adds.</p>
<p>Bahoshy is expecting further layoffs in the tech industry as mergers are explored by companies seeking to strengthen their position in the market.</p>
<p>Ray Dargham, chief executive of Step Group, which hosts tech shows, was more optimistic. Step Conference 2020 was held in February, and was its largest conference to date, with 300 startups participating. The Gulf tech scene has come a long way since Step began in 2012, Dargham says, producing several $100 million startups and one unicorn exit (Careem, which was acquired by Uber for $3.1 billion).</p>
<p>“The second cycle of the startup ecosystem, whereby the founders and staff who benefited from these exits will go on to launch new startups or funds, has just started,” he says.</p>
<p>However, the industry continues to be hindered by regulation as well as high setup costs, Dargham says. There was also beginning to be some market saturation, especially in e-commerce, food-tech, and logistics, which is where many of the redundancies are now coming from.</p>
<p>However, Dargham, who is originally from Lebanon, is optimistic that a possible influx of his countrymen into Dubai—as they flee their homeland’s economic crisis, which was exacerbated by the devastating explosion in Beirut in August—could bring about a new wave of tech entrepreneurs. After all, the Lebanese built much of the region’s advertising industry as they fled the country’s civil war between 1975 and 1990, and settled in nearby countries, such as Kuwait, Greece, and Cyprus. Later, many of the agencies’ head offices moved to Dubai, resulting in a thriving local advertising industry. So could we see something similar happen now?</p>
<p>Dargham believes so, but it’s a bittersweet moment for him. “Witnessing the vast numbers of Lebanese friends fleeing to Dubai is both heartbreaking and relieving for me,” Dargham says. “It’s heartbreaking because of all that’s happening in my country. It’s relieving because I know that they are coming to a great home, which has always been safe and prosperous for many Lebanese and Arabs running away from our countries’ miseries. If it weren’t for Dubai, I don’t know where we would go.”</p>
<p>Bahoshy agrees that Dubai could become a safe haven for Lebanese tech experts. “Talent in Lebanon has always been a strength for its ecosystem and economy, and yet as an economy or market for startups, has always been limited for growth. These startups can export their businesses to markets with larger consumer access while further developing their propositions,” he says.</p>
<p>Carrington Malin, a UAE-based entrepreneur and consultant, believes there has never been a more exciting time for the tech industry, due to the Covid-induced demand from the private and public sectors. But as lower oil revenues and the pandemic force companies to become leaner than ever, job roles are being adjusted—and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Overall, this could be a blessing in disguise. Most businesses don’t look at new ways of doing things quite often enough,” he says.</p>
<p>The pandemic has meant that Gulf countries are now more resolute that new technologies will play a central role in their economic and social development, Malin says, and are “putting the initiatives in place to turn these into reality.” This means that future careers in technology and IT could be more attractive than ever for citizens and expats alike.</p>
<p>But, especially in the UAE, with 80 percent of its workforce coming from outside the country, has enough been done to bring Emiratis into the startup fold? Last year, a report on pre-seed startups by entrepreneurship platform Wamda found that Emiratis make up just 3 percent of the entrepreneurs in the UAE, despite the country’s best efforts to foster local talent.</p>
<p>Malin believes this is because the growth of Gulf economies has outstripped the local talent base, and “government departments have tended to monopolize the employment of top local IT talent.” This means Emiratis in tech have traditionally moved into roles in management. But that could be set to change.</p>
<p>“It’s not the best way to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, local research and development, nor leadership in the tech sector,” he says. “Attitudes are changing though and we’re now seeing a wide range of initiatives put in place by governments that will incentivize youth to look toward technology as a career. We’re going to see the Gulf’s pool of homegrown tech talent grow much faster now.”</p>
<p>Massimo Cannizzo, Middle East chief executive of startup support platform Gellify, which is headquartered in Italy but has a hub in Dubai, believes 2020 could herald a new age of globalization in Gulf tech. Companies could be more willing to leverage expertise remotely, he says. “It was previously necessary to have people here in the office and be part of an organization and move their family here. But remote working has changed that.”</p>
<p>However, for companies to be particularly innovative, there needs to be person-to-person …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Approaching this behemoth of an industry called web development can be overwhelming at times, everybody had that feeling of missing out on web development, especially the chaos that's happening in the <em>front-end world</em>...</p>
<p>...But just like any other problem, you break it down into smaller pieces. Think of the areas in web development you're lacking knowledge, then look for resources to fill that gap.</p>
<p>You also need to <em>practice learning</em> to be more proficient in it. Have a really good understanding of the basic programming principles first, that drive web development.</p>
<p>Focus on the fundamentals if you think you're lacking knowledge in that area, then build on top of that the new techniques and strategies that interest you.</p>
<p>There's too much noise on the Internet as it is, especially in tech, you need to focus on <em>extracting the signal</em> from the noise. By focusing on the programming principles you're building on top of a solid foundation because programming principles rarely change, it gets re-invented. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a> is not new, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> isn't either, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">SRP</a> were all invented in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>With experience, you'll realize that a solid foundation is key, and the major difference between most web development programming languages is just the syntax only.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have a very narrow set of problems that only a specific programming language can solve, in other cases it truly is just a matter of preference, community adoption and the available resources you have on hand.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about good programming principles, check out my blog post on the <a target="_blank" href="https://primalskill.blog/10-books-every-programmer-should-read">10 books every programmer should read</a> where I cover books presenting these programming principles.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you need to love web development, love programming, then learning will be easy, but if you're a <em>9 to 5</em> programmer, not really interested in software, then you're going to have a hard time leveling up to be a better programmer.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have a life outside work, on the contrary, work-life balance is really important.</p>
<p><strong>You need to invest time and energy every week to learn something new.</strong></p>
<h2 id="old-is-new-again">Old is New Again</h2>
<p>There's no such thing as the wrong approach in web development, it's more like the wrong solution to that set of problems you're trying to solve, and showing off your new programming techniques is usually the wrong solution for the problem. 😃</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay <strong>NOT</strong> to use the latest and greatest packages, modules, or techniques in your codebase, changing it out every day because something newer and shinier was released is almost always the wrong approach.</p>
<p>It's a much better strategy to use tried and battle-tested code instead, especially because of the dynamic nature of software development.</p>
<p>It's also a fallacy that not using the newest programming language or the latest framework you'll be doing a disservice to your project. You can solve 99% of the problems with any programming language. </p>
<h2 id="cut-out-90-of-the-news">Cut out 90% of the news</h2>
<p>Get off social media, stop procrastinating, and cut out any distractions while you're working. Practice async, passive information gathering, meaning, not to jump on a new video, blog, or podcast instantly, instead save it for later and keep a schedule for learning new things.</p>
<p>You can organize your streams and feed with a note-taking app, and keep a <em>log</em> of what you've learned on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>You can use apps like <a target="_blank" href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, created for this purpose, to filter the information overload you're being bombarded with daily. They even use an AI assistant that will learn from your habits and will filter out news for you.</p>
<h2 id="start-your-own-blog">Start your own blog</h2>
<p>If you want to really get neck-deep in a subject you want to learn, I think, the best way to do it is to write about it. You'll be <em>forced</em> to research the topic in-depth filling the gaps in your knowledge in the process.</p>
<p>Starting a blog is not complicated anymore, with services like <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> it's 5 minutes to create your own blog and start writing.</p>
<p>The benefit of creating a blog on such services is that you will also get a huge audience from the get-go.</p>
<h2 id="other-tips">Other Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Read source code: </strong> most beginner developers I've met just don't read other developers source code at all. Why? Reading source code should be thought in schools 😁, it's one of the most fundamental things you should do if you're in software development.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: Do you know what's inside <code>node_modules</code>? Do you know what code a module or package contains? </p>
<p>You can learn awesome techniques, simply by, reading other developer's code, and more importantly, you can <strong>vet</strong> that code for security exploits, maybe even fix it and create PRs, it's a win-win.</p>
<p><strong>Share and discuss:</strong> news, tutorials, and techniques with your friends in tech or your co-workers. It's very important to get feedback on your ideas, programming techniques, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Get active on forums:</strong> it may be counterintuitive, and I personally, don't like to follow a bunch of people on social media, because it usually adds noise to my daily work, but by following a narrow set of topics on Reddit or Twitter can be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Get familiar with Github:</strong> look at what's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trending">trending on the website</a>, watch releases for repositories you're interested in, or popular repos, just to stay up to date on what direction the industry is pulling right now.</p>
<p>You can also follow <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics">topics</a> which gives you an overview of repository and user activities related to that topic, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/data-structures">data structures</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/docker">Docker</a>.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>It's important to <em>learn how to learn</em> new things, but also to find the <em>signal in the noise</em>. Here are a couple of resources, that you could use to stay up-to-date with the new info.</p>
<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>
<p>Find information hubs on the topics you're interested in. Blogs are a great resource for that, subscribe to influential authors' feed, remember RSS? Google tried to kill it, but it's coming back! 😊</p>
<p>Follow tech information <em>hubs</em>, but be vary, the content on these websites can be overwhelming and of lower quality unless it’s a curated feed.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> - is a good place to find articles organized by topics (e.g. tags), just follow a couple of tags that you're interested in.</li>

<h3 id="educational-websites">Educational Websites</h3>
<p>Educational websites are also a great way to level up on web development. You can look at the trending or <em>what's hot</em> sections on these websites to get the best courses on the topics you're interested in.</p>
<p>Even though these services are not free, it's worth the investment, because you'll get a reviewed, well-thought-out video course covering the topic from A to Z.</p>

                    This is an example customer lifecycle definition with

                    The actual process can be of any complexity, contain nested sub-processes, invoke 
                    other processes by starting or signaling them, call external services or publish

                    BPMN diagram button downloads a definition XML file; SVG image button generates a vector image.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Clear is the author of Atomic Habits, who popularized the idea of habits over goals. Last month he shared <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">the rules he uses for running his business</a>, based on his 10-year experience. Among the rules was this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build assets that compound. Eliminate problems, responsibilities, and obligations that compound. Your business should feel easier to sustain each year.</p>
<p>James Clear (from <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">How I run my business</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Your business should feel easier to sustain each year." What if, instead of business, we focus on building software? And what if we turn the advice into a question? Then, we get: <em>does our codebase feel easier to sustain each year?</em></p>
<p>I love that question:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reveals the long-term vision of how to approach software engineering.</li>
<li>It encourages challenging missions to <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">remove complexity</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?t=1256">target the important non-urgent quadrant</a>.</li>
<li>It exposes the murky alternative, that is, descending further into the complexity tar pit.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I've found that the question brings fresh air and whirls settled dust.</p>

<b>Ask Marilyn ®</b> by Marilyn vos Savant is a column in <i>Parade Magazine</i>,
published by PARADE, 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017, USA.
According to Parade, Marilyn vos Savant is listed in the
"Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame" for "Highest IQ."
</p><div><a name="FAQ">
</a><li><a name="FAQ">What is Marilyn's email address?
</a><p><a name="FAQ">PARADE announced on June 8, 1997 that email to Marilyn can be sent to
</a><a href="mailto:marilyn@parade.com">marilyn@parade.com</a>
</p></li><li>Precisely where (edition and category) is Marilyn listed in <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>?
<p>
<a href="mailto:Citeon@prodigy.net">Citeon &lt;Citeon@prodigy.net&gt;</a>
reports that:
</p><blockquote>
She is listed on page 26 of the 1989 Edition.
It says "...as a ten year old achieved a ceiling score for 23-year-olds,
thus giving her an IQ of 228."
Her record was retired to the guinness hall of fame because scores that
high are no longer possible due to a lowering of test score ceilings.
(As I'm sure you're already guessing it's because scores that high
weren't very valid in the first place.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="mailto:DOlmstead@aol.com">Linda &lt;DOlmstead@aol.com&gt;</a>
disagrees with Citeon about the validity of high test scores:
</p><blockquote>
IQs that high are legitimate.  None of the standard IQ tests in use today for children
(Stanford-Binet Fourth Edition and WISC-III) were designed to identify the
highly gifted.  It is standard practice to use the older Stanford-Binet Form
L-M when a child is at or near the ceiling score on the other newer test.
<p>
Please check out Linda Silverman's
<a href="http://www.gifteddevelopment.com/">Gifted Development Center</a> web site

programs, presentations, and resources for gifted children and adults.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here are some <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/iq.html">additional comments about Marilyn's IQ</a> <small> (10/03/98) </small>
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/course/topics/Monty_Hall.html">
Behind Monty Hall's Doors</a>, Marilyn's IQ is 228.

</p></li><li>What books has Marilyn written?
<ul>
<li><i>Ask Marilyn</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1992, ISBN 0-312-08136-7.
</li><li><i>The World's Most Famous Math Problem:
       The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and Other Mathematical Mysteries</i>,
       St. Martin's Press, 1993, 0-312-10657-2.

</li></ul>

</li><li>Is Marilyn married? Who is her husband?
<p>
<a href="mailto:rory@carmelnet.com">Rory Sellers &lt;rory@carmelnet.com&gt;</a>
reports that Marilyn is married to the "Jarvik guy who invented the artificial heart".

</p></li><li>How do you feel about Marilyn?
<p>
Marilyn is more intelligent than I am, as measured by standard intelligence tests.
There are some areas in which I am more knowledgeable (trained or educated) than
Marilyn, just as there are some areas that Marilyn is more knowledgeable than I.
</p><p>
I do not hate Marilyn, and I am not jealous of her. I respected her more in the
past than I do now. I do not think I am better than Marilyn, and Marilyn certainly
has answered questions that would have stumped me. Furthermore, I am sure that
Marilyn is far more profitable for <i>Parade Magazine</i> than I could ever be.
</p><p>
I am concerned that some people believe that everything Marilyn says is correct
(except in the few cases that Marilyn has admitted error), just because she is
smarter than we are.
</p><p>
<b>This is not true!</b> Marilyn <b>does</b> make mistakes, and here they are.
</p><p>
I do wonder, though, why Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy" (see below).
Is she afraid to confront her mistakes?

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn know about this web site?
<p>Eric Zorn, of the Chicago Tribune, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.chicago.tribune.com/columns/zorn/archives/80597z.htm</u>
Marilyn is aware of this web site, but has never visited.
</p><p>Rich Morin, of the Washington Post, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1998-06/14/133l-061498-idx.html</u>
Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy".
</p><p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine are also aware of this web site (see below).

</p></li><li>Why was your site shut down between June 9 and June 30, 1998?
    And why do you no longer include the original question and Marilyn's answer?
<p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine claimed that the amount of copyrighted material that I used
   exceeded what is permissible under the fair use provision of the copyright laws.
   Rather than contest their claim, I shut down the site until I could remove the offending material.
   I have tried to avoid biasing the material in my paraphrasing.

</p></li><li>How can I judge for myself whether Marilyn is Wrong if you no longer include
    the original question and answer published in Parade Magazine?
    Is there any way for me to obtain the original columns?
<p><a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Back issues</a> are now available directly from
    <a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Parade Magazine</a>
    for $3.00 per issue.
    Thanks to <a href="mailto:bs25@cornell.edu">Ben Sandler &lt;bs25@cornell.edu&gt;</a>
    for pointing me to <a href="http://www.parade.com/">Parade Magazine</a>'s web site.  <small> (06/14/00) </small>

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn have a research staff or depend upon outside assistance to answer the
    questions that appear in her columns?
<p><a href="mailto:bratach@gate.sunquest.com">Pete Bratach &lt;bratach@gate.sunquest.com&gt;</a> provides some information about <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/research.html">Marilyn's Research Staff</a>  <small> (11/01/99) </small>

    If the government implements the COVID cess, it will be the latest in line of measures to boost revenue at a time when it has implemented several policies that either reduce government collections or increase its spendings.

<p>States have been facing pressure in revenues because of economic slowdown and corporate tax cuts, which means that the government is stretched to meet its spending needs. Goods and services tax (GST) collections have also struggled for a good part of 2020, in large part due to the pandemic and lockdown. Further, India’s growth rate is

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1773">
    
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I have been toying with the idea of migrating this blog to a static site to simplify its maintenance for some time. While <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress </a>is a great tool, this blog is a side project and any time I have to spend maintaining WordPress gets deducted from the time I have to write for the blog. Keep in mind that I’m self-hosting this blog and it’s actually running on a Linux VM that only handles the blog. That is yet another server that I need to administer, and it’s the odd one out, too, as all of the others are FreeBSD or OpenBSD servers.</p>
<p>Oh, and one of the big advantages of using a static site generator is that the whole site can be put in version control, archived there and also quickly re-generated from there should I manage to spectacularly mess up the host. A WordPress restore is a fair amount more work, as I found out about two years ago.</p>
<p>The only parts that don’t back up that well are the comments, especially if I use a self-hosted system for them.</p>
<h2>Migration is fine, but what to?</h2>
<p>For that reason, I had experimented with moving the blog to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for quite a while. In fact, I have maintained a parallel Jekyll blog for years now. For a smooth switch over, the devil was in the details though, and I was never happy enough to actually migrate and shutdown the WordPress site.</p>
<p>After another patchapalooza, I revisited the idea of converting the blog to a static site and looked at several other static site generators. I also decided to resurrect an experiment I had started with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. My first attempt hadn’t been very successful, so I stuck with Jekyll. This second attempt however is a lot more successful as it addressed a couple of the issues that kept me from being happy with Jekyll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo builds the site much faster than Jekyll</li>
<li>I found a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/">theme</a> that I’m really happy with.</li>
<li>It looks like some of the details that I found hard to get right in Jekyll are already handled nicely in Hugo. This is mostly around the RSS feed generation – Hugo by default generates category feeds in addition to the regular “full” feed. It also looks like the category feeds are very similar path-wise to what WordPress uses, so hopefully the RSS feeds should continue working with the couple of aggregators that picked up this blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, this time I succeeded in importing the site from Jekyll into Hugo. It took some work to clean up some of the artifacts that originated in the WP-to-Jekyll conversion, and then I had to convert the Liquid template code to Hugo shortcodes. The latter was pretty easy, but a bit tedious. Just not tedious enough to write a script to do it.</p>
<h2>Hugo can render org-mode files (and so can Jekyll, apparently)</h2>
<p>Another nice feature is that my workflow can still use org-mode for when I want to use it to write longer posts. Shorter posts I usually crank out in Markdown, but for the more complex posts it’s nice to have org-mode as an option. <em>Especially</em> if the post contains source code.</p>
<p>While the setup I described before with using org-mode to post to WordPress is mostly working, it’s a bit clunky especially if you’re using more than one computer to work on blog posts. Both Jekyll and Hugo can handle org-mode files directly – in fact, even though this file would be as effortless to write as Markdown, what you are currently reading is actually a processed org-mode file. Assuming that you’re reading this on the <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">static site</a>, that is.</p>
<h2>What’s left to before the actual cutover?</h2>
<p>There are two fairly large items I have to tick off the todo list before I can cut over for good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate the comments. Now this blog doesn’t get a ton of comments, but I appreciate all of them and am trying to migrate them over to this blog. As I believe in self-hosting everything, I’m experimenting with <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">isso</a>, and I need to redo some of the experiments with Hugo as so far, they’ve been completely focussed on Jekyll. Hugo does have built in support for disqus, plus this theme has support for staticman, but neither of the two are my preferred alternatives.</li>
<li>QA the site, especially the RSS feeds so that they hopefully keep working as they do right now.</li>
<li>There are still some minor tweaks to be done, analytics integrated and all that, but those are probably going to happen slowly after the cutover.</li>
<li>Oh, and the last item is all of the draft posts that have accumulated on WordPress that I somehow never got around to finishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beta of the static site is <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">here</a> if you want to have a look. Any feedback is welcome.</p>

        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>
<h3 id="build-an-interpretercompiler">Build an interpreter/compiler</h3>
<p>At their core, <strong>interpreters and compilers are layers and layers of small transformations to your source code (a string of text) into …</strong></p></article></div>

I have <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/hoods/">written about 56 of the 77</a> Chicago neighborhoods but left out 21 of them; the reason why is because those 21 neighborhoods do not have a significant enough gang history throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries due to a lack of poverty, consistent strong community ties and being consistently economically flourishing.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Mount Greenwood and Edison Park have been known to have zero homicides for 10 or more years at a time.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Forest Glen, North Center, O’Hare, Norwood Park, North Park and Beverly are very close to Mount Greenwood and Edison Park with almost no murders and no gang violence.&nbsp; Anywhere you look on the internet or read stats about these neighborhoods you will see a correlation with the lack of gang activity in these neighborhoods past and present with low crime rates; another interesting thing is most of these neighborhoods border the suburbs.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods had a stint of gang activity in decades past; however, it was not enough to delve into a whole history of the neighborhood as there was no real socioeconomic or any other sociological reasons gangs were there in such neighborhoods as: Dunning, Jefferson Park, Portage Park and Montclare.&nbsp; Some neighborhoods I did not get into because they have some roughness throughout history, but not enough to really delve deeper, these neighborhoods such as: West Ridge, West Lawn, Edgewater, West Elsdon, East Side, Avondale, Hegewish, Ashburn and Clearing have only had a moderate level of gang violence over the course of history mainly though the 20<sup>th</sup> century and most importantly no significant street gangs were formed in any of the 20 neighborhoods I just mentioned. The only one that had a significant gang form within its borders was Hyde Park that is the home of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Devil’s Disciples. </a>At the time of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Disciples</a>&nbsp;being founded, the northern part of Hyde Park was a little rough for the first half of the 1960s decade but the issues that brought about the gangs were long ago eradicated and there was nothing else to discuss about Hyde Park after that.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods I dove into because of their past but presently these areas have become a lot safer and changed their whole look, neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/north-center/">North Center</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-park/">Lincoln Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-square/">Lincoln Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lakeview/">Lake View</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/irving-park/">Irving Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/garfield-ridge/">Garfield Ridge</a> and the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> have experienced huge makeovers in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that make them almost unrecognizable to those that walked those streets in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. these renovations also ended up pushing out most gang activity in these regions.&nbsp; Some other neighborhoods had stronger gang activity and violence in the 20<sup>th</sup> century but ever since the 21<sup>st</sup> century urban renewal, rising property values, gentrification and crack downs by police and residents, have greatly reduced violence and gang activity in these neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/belmont-cragin/">Belmont-Cragin</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/logan-square/">Logan Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/armour-square/">Armour Square</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/albany-park/">Albany Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/uptown/">Uptown</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/rogers-park">Rogers Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/bridgeport/">Bridgeport</a>, West Town, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/kenwood/">Kenwood</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/hermosa">Hermosa</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/archer-heights/">Archer Heights</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/mckinley-park">McKinley Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Lower West Side</a> (<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Pilsen</a>), <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/brighton-park/">Brighton Park</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a> have seen massive improvements over time but still have quite a ways to go, however, these area have become significantly safer.</p>
<p>The rest of the other 31 neighborhoods still struggle with heavy violence and gang wars as the bodies stack up and crime is high.&nbsp; The 56 neighborhoods that have been explored above, all play a key role in the early formation of street gangs in Chicago and have molded the top organizations that we see active on the streets today that have even spread as far as other countries.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>We all know someone that is in a Chicago based street gang that we know comes from a comfortable home in a livable and/or safer neighborhood and we wonder why they are in a gang despite having a decent life; the answer to that question could be answered by sociologists and psychologists with answers along the lines of needing to fit in, peer pressure etc… but the organization that individual is a part of did not start in a well off neighborhood and did not come from the middle class sections of the city or <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs.</a>&nbsp;These organizations came from the darkest and ugliest side of Chicago history that came from poverty, racism and survival.&nbsp; Many sections of these organizations still suffer from these factors but many are just gang banging for the heck of it, as that is commonly seen in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs;</a>&nbsp;especially when you see gang banging in communities like <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Naperville</a>, Palatine or even <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Oak Brook</a>.</p>
<p>Racism was the first and largest factor that created street gangs and organized crime in this city because being discriminated against leads an individual to not receive the opportunities for advancement in life such as: equal housing, equal employment and equal education.&nbsp; We cannot argue against the fact that African Americans have had it the worst throughout history as far as discrimination is concerned and this was started as soon as African Americans were sold by their chiefs and brought to this country on slave boats, even supposed “free men” in the old days were pushed to live in the most decrepit and most undesirable living situations to the point where many felt slavery was a better alternative.</p>
<p>This city was first settled (by a non-Native American) by a man with dark skin and from the African ancestral country of Haiti before any other non-Native American wanted to live on these lands that are now Chicago.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Du Sable was first and he was black it did not matter; once this military fort was converted into a town and then a city in the 1830s the African Americans that came to help build this city were forced to live in a confined area in the present day <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, neighborhood away from the white settlers. Whites were allowed to settle in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">West Loop</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, and in actuality, the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> part was not even annexed into the city in the 1830s; therefore, blacks were not even allowed in Chicago in the first decade of the city’s existence.</p>
<p>Another hated group were the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> in early history, which is hard to fathom for modern societies’ understanding because they have white skin. In reality there were signs in many cities that read <strong>“NO BLACKS AND NO IRISH”</strong> and this was put in front of store fronts and also in front of manufacturing businesses that were hiring that also paid a decent wage.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> were allowed to live among their fellow white man; however, they were forced to take the crappiest and most dilapidated housing, they also were only allowed to take the lowest income and the worst positions nobody wanted. This discrimination led to the first ghetto in Chicago known as “<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>” that was located in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> neighborhood in the southwest quadrant in the areas of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> (now <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/housing-project/cabrini-green">Cabrini Green</a> area), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Smokey Hallow</a> (Now the western part of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">River North</a>), and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Goose Island</a>.&nbsp; This was the first slum, the first crime ridden area, the first site of poverty and socioeconomic issues.&nbsp; This area was also the birth place of street gangs and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian Mafia</a>, it all started here in this mostly <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> slum. When <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> first came to this city in the 1880s most of them were pushed into this slum while the rest had to settle in rural Hyde Park Township or Lake Township outside the city limits and fend for themselves. Those that arrived in the city limits got shoved into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> with the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and were forced to live a life of anguish earning low wages, living in deteriorated housing, living among garbage and filth, living with no running water or plumbing just like the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a>.&nbsp; Even the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> had their own restrictions in <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> as they did not want blacks living there; however, the rest of the city did not want blacks either unless they lived near the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Vice District</a> (and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Levee</a>), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Gamblers Row</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Whiskey Row</a> in the southern part of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a> or on in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> shabbier buildings, when those buildings became crowded, blacks were allowed to move into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>No matter where African Americans chose to settle, it was the same story of poverty, slums and living among criminals and hooligans in run down apartments or dilapidated cottages.&nbsp; Despite living among so many criminals the black man did not take up a life of crime because he knew that stealing that loaf of bread would cause him to be hung while the white man would get a small jail stint, so the vast majority of early African Americans did not run with street gangs or partake in or create organized crime with the exception of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">John “Mushmouth” Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Little Hell</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">South Loop</a> and also in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/new-city/">Back of The Yards</a> people lived in such awful conditions and desperately wanted to escape this life; however, restraints based upon ethnicity and race did not allow upward mobility which made many resort to a life of crime because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian</a>, because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and later because they were black.</p>
<p>Until the 1890s African Americans were forced to live in the slums of once great buildings built during early settlement leftover from whites that had moved up in the world. In the 1890s blacks now wanted to move to <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/grand-boulevard/">Grand Boulevard</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a> and as they settled in these better areas the white community reacted in protest and even violence. Another reaction from the whites was to move out of the neighborhood for the simple reason that they did not want black neighbors despite the fact that black people posed no threat and were mostly law abiding citizens; much of it had to do with pride, they felt if they had black neighbors then they were living among poverty, it was all about image apparently.&nbsp; Proper and easier assimilation of blacks into these two neighborhoods was perhaps extremely vital in Chicago history because if this would have worked out without white flight and disinvestment happening in these …</p></div></div>

        <p>I don't remember the day but I was talking with a friend of mine about the benefit vs drawback of a exact match domain vs a brand domain.</p><p>I guess first I should explain what an exact match domain is, simply put, it would be the .com of what ever search the user might be doing in a search engine, such as google, bing, yandex, long or short, say "cars" the exact match would be cars.com, or "used cars" the exact match would be usedcars.com</p><p>Now a brand domain, would be something like Yout or IBM.&nbsp; Now of course these words mean nothing.&nbsp; So they can be anything.</p><p>The discussion was that there was a company back in the day that had started out with an exact match domain in a specific sector.&nbsp; Say cupakes.com and from there they went on and bought donuts.com, as they developed each out as one or both grew then acquiring a third, and so on.</p><p>They then got a point where they had decided they should instead make a brand, instead of managing each of the sites individually.&nbsp; So they launched a unified amazon type site, and redirected all their sites to the respective location on their brand site.</p><p>Of course their brand site went on to either go public or sold off for a large amount .&nbsp; Either way that would be determined a success.&nbsp; This of course showed that if you just start out as a brand in the beginning and execute well you can do everything.</p><p>So I guess it's more of semantics and my love for exact match domains given that I still think an exact match domain is the best way to enter any niche, and perhaps maybe not the best, but the most ever green if done well.&nbsp; </p><p>Now of course if you start expanding into other niches, or that was your original plan, I still think the scenario in which I described it would of still been beneficial to have launched an individual brand site and put a sort of "powered by" and maintained each of them running once you have enough exact matches or are doing well enough in one niche that you dominate it so well that you move onto the next, that it would be foolish to not, at least dominate twice the amount of the niche.&nbsp; I think more specifically because each niche has it quirks as well so by unifying you end up neglecting those.<br></p>

        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-10</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This story goes back several years, to when I was working at Hipmunk on the
Backend Platform Team. Among the many varied responsibilities of this team<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>,
we were responsible for maintaining our integrations with our partners via their
APIs. Most of these partner APIs returned data as nested dictionaries, encoded
as <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>. You may be able to imagine that
some of these APIs were less reliable than others, and so we had adapted with a
bag of tricks to deal with malformed and outright bad data. The story I'm about
to tell you describes when I got carried away trying to solve one specific
problem, the consequences it had, and the lessons I've learned from it.</p>

<h3>The nature of the problem</h3>

<p>First, lets abstract away the specifics of our API integration. In essence, we
would make some kind of standard, authenticated request to our partner, and the response
would be in the form of a JSON encoding of some nested dictionary tree structure. It would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
        "mandatory_key": "some attribute",
	"optional_key": "some attribute",
	"nested_object_1": {
            "key_1": "value 1",
	    "optional_nested_object_2a": {
                "key_1": "value 1"
		"possible_display_key": "display me if present",
            },
	    "nested_object_2b": {
		"possible_display_key": "display me as a fallback",
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pay attention to <code>possible_display_key</code>, which appears twice in this response.
This is a stripped-back example of what the problem was, both in the number of
missing fields, and the depth of nesting. <code>optional_nested_object_2a</code> may or may
not be present in the response returned by the partner, depending on whether
their data covered that use case. For a fictional example, the entire hotel
image subtree might be missing from the results for a specific hotel if the
partner we queried had no images for that hotel.</p>

<p>Our code that tried to pull out these values was written with the end uses in
mind. So these missing subtrees made for clunky code, like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    nested_object_1 = response['result']['nested_object_1']
    if 'optional_nested_object_2a' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']:
        return nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']['possible_display_key']
    if 'nested_object_2b' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['nested_object_2b']:
        return nested_object_1['nested_object_2']['possible_display_key']
    return 'some default'

</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I need you to put in some effort to imagine what it actually looked
like, since those nestings could be 3-6 layers deep of potentially missing
structures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. Our parser code was trying to express that we wanted to do something
with the element at a certain path, if it existed. Because entire subtrees might
be missing, however, we needed to be careful about how we traversed the
structure, so that we didn't throw a <code>KeyError</code> if we accidentally stepped off
the tree.</p>

<p>Over time, we settled on an idiom that used the default parameter of
<code>dict.get()</code>, and it looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    return (
        response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'optional_nested_object_2a', {}).get('possible_display_key')
        or response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'nested_object_2b', {}).get('possible_display_key')
	or 'some default
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the depth, we'd need to chain those <code>.get</code>s so they'd look like:</p>

<pre><code>return response.get('foo', {}).get('bar', {}'
       ).get('baz', {}).get('quux', {}) or 'default'
</code></pre>

<h4>Why not just catch the KeyError?</h4>

<p>Why not rely on <code>KeyError</code> to detect when a value was missing? It's a common adage in Python that it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#:~:text=Easier%20to%20ask">Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission</a>, and so most idiomatic Python would use:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    val = response['foo']['bar']['baz']
except KeyError:
    val = "default"
</code></pre>

<p>Well, the reason was just one of convenience. <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> define clauses,
which cannot be part of expressions in the language. What we wanted was to be
able to write concise expressions like:</p>

<pre><code>response['foo']['bar']['baz'] or response['foo']['bar']['baz2']
</code></pre>

<p>without needing to pad out the number of lines.</p>

<h4>Why pick out fields rather than unmarshalling objects</h4>

<p>Another question that you might have is why not parse the entire API response
structure into objects, and then use methods of those objects to find what we
want, rather than querying dict trees? The answer there is cost. We had scores
of these API integrations to maintain, and our partners all had different domain
models for their objects.</p>

<p>For example, some APIs would represent the Lat/Long coordinates of an Airport as
part of the Airport object. Others might have a Location object within the
Airport, which then had the coordinates in there. The purpose of our integration
code was to pick out the coordinates, and put them into the common structured
object model we had for all such requests. Maintaining another set of objects to
represent each partner's structure would bloat the code for no additional
purpose.</p>

<h3>Enter LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</h3>

<p>This was where I had my bright idea. I wasn't the first person to come up with
the idea of a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19189274/nested-defaultdict-of-defaultdict/27809959">recursive
defaultdict</a>.</p>

<p>However, applying it to the problem of parsing these APIs seemed so <em>clever</em>,
that I was genuinely pleased with myself for having thought of it. That must
have been why I was so eager to implement it, despite the concerns my reviewers
raised about the excess complexity.</p>

<p>The code itself was very small. First let's have the code, and then I'll go
through the points I want to you notice. Remember, this is a cautionary tale, so
please don't add this in any production context. Also, I don't have access to
the original code anymore, so I threw this code together for this blog article.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

class LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(defaultdict):
    """Do not use in production."""

    def __init__(self, tree=None):
        if tree is None:
            tree = {}

        super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__init__(
            LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, tree)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        retval = super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__getitem__(key)
        if isinstance(retval, dict):
            return LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(retval)
        return retval
</code></pre>

<p>A LazyRecursiveDefaultDict is a subclass of defaultdict. Defaultdict is a type
of collection available in the Python standard library. It behaves like
a dictionary, with the added ability to specify a default value for missing
keys. Judicious use of defaultdict simplifies a lot of code.</p>

<p>This code uses a recursive definition at <code>__init__</code> to set the default
constructed dictionary to be an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict. This way, any
number of nested, missed accesses would just return an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response["foo"]["bar"]["wrong"][
...     "somewhere"]["these"]["keys"]["are"]["missing"]
defaultdict(&lt;class '__main__.LazyRecursiveDefaultDict'&gt;, {})
</code></pre>

<p>The reason this is Lazy, is so that it doesn't have to process the entire tree
of dictionaries, converting them all, at construction time. By overriding
<code>__getitem__</code>, I was able to make sure that whenever the item being returned was
a dictionary, the appropriate construction code would come into play.</p>

<h3>Rollout, adoption, eventual fall</h3>

<p>I initially wrote this while implementing an API integration, whose rollout was
successful. I reported about LazyRecursiveDefaultDict to my teammates, and
recommended that we start adopting it more widely. And then, after I'd
publicly let everyone know that this tool was available for everyone's use,
the problems started!</p>

<p>Some of our existing parsers relied on the fact that nested accesses would
throw KeyErrors if not met. They had been written over many years of edge
cases, planned and unplanned mutations to external APIs, and changes to our
systems, and so there was a lot of surface area to cover. I had thought that all
we needed to do was to convert the response tree to <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code>,
to start reaping the benefits. Instead, we found that this exposed all sorts of
subtle errors started showing up in testing.</p>

<p>In addition, we found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Debugging became harder, now that there was another recursive data structure
to reason about</p></li>

<li><p>There was a lot of needless copying during every dictionary access</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict didn't convert the objects returned from APIs if they were an element of a list</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDicts were escaping their contexts, since parsers might
send them for logging or error reporting, and they had the potential to cause
subtle problems there too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these problems were unsolvable. However, solving those problems would
require writing more code, making this class even more complex. That forced me
to think about how much I was willing to invest in this as a solution, and
whether it was the right tool for the job.</p>

<h3>Restoration, and Replacement</h3>

<p>As soon as I realized that <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code> was not the panacea we
were looking for, I made sure to ticket work to remove it. In the end, a simple
solution was much better, a function that looked something like:</p>

<pre><code>def get_from_tree(
    tree: dict,
    path: typing.List[typing.Union[str, int]],
    default=None):
    """Implementation left as an exercise for the reader.

    Hint: use a for loop to traverse the path, picking
    your way down the tree. If you get a KeyError
    (or an IndexError!), return the default value instead.
    """

# Call it this way:
get_from_tree(response, ["foo", "bar", "baz", "quux"], "default")
</code></pre>

<p>The function was much easier to understand, which lowered the barrier to
adoption by the members of our team. …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a> 
for more information. Also, check out the samples <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Understanding and managing storage in Linux is essential. There are several key concepts and commands for working with block storage.</p> <p><span>If you are an absolute beginner in configuring storage on Linux, then this article is for you.</span></p><p>Here we will discuss:</p><ul><li>Block storage device naming and the <code>/dev</code> directory</li><li>Disk partitioning</li><li>Creating and mounting filesystems</li><li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</li></ul><ol></ol><h2><span id="Prerequisites"></span>Prerequisites<span></span></h2><ul><li>A server running Linux preferably CentOS 7 or higher</li><li>At least 2 free storage devices</li></ul><h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2><p>Every physical server or virtual machine has some directly attached block devices. These can be HDD, SSD, or USB Flash drives.</p><p>Whenever a new block device is inserted into the system, the available capacity is not immediately accessible. In other words, files and directories cannot be directly created on the device.</p><p>Some basic configuration is required to make the storage space available. It includes creating partitions, creating filesystems, and mounting.</p><p>Before we start discussing the commands relative to these operations, let’s talk about the <code>/dev</code> directory and block device naming.</p><h2><span id="Block_storage_device_naming"></span>Block storage device naming<span></span></h2><p>Linux handles storage devices as files. These files are stored under the <code>/dev</code> directory. It’s critical to understand this concept because most storage commands take files from this directory as their arguments. Many system programs also use these files as the interface for Input/Output or I/O operations with the block devices.</p><p>Whenever a new block device is inserted or detected, the system automatically creates a new corresponding file under the directory <code>/dev</code>.</p><p>The name of this file depends on several things. Most importantly, it depends on the device bus type and the order in which the device was inserted relative to the other devices.</p><p>For example, if the bus type is SCSI or SATA, the first half of the file name is <code>sd</code>. The other half is a letter assigned in alphabetical order depending on the order in which the device was detected.</p><p>The first, second, and third SCSI devices on a system are named <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, and <code>sdc</code>, respectively.</p><p>Devices with other bus types are subject to slightly different naming rules. For NVMe, which is a modern bus type, the first part of the device name is <code>nvme</code>. There is also a bus number added in the middle. The final part is a letter and a number, which indicate the order of detection. For example: <code>nvme0n1</code> or <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p><p>We can list the <code>/dev</code> directory content to get an overview of all the block devices present on the system.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">ls /dev</pre><p><img width="880" height="162" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w"></p><p>There are many files, including <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, <code>sda1</code>, <code>sda2</code>, <code>nvme0n1</code>, and <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p><p>Note that <code>/dev </code>also includes other files that are not related to storage devices.</p><p><code>sda</code> and <code>sdb</code> are block devices. However, <code>sda1</code> and <code>sda2</code> don’t represent actual block devices. They represent partitions, which are discussed next.</p><h2><span id="Partitioning"></span>Partitioning<span></span></h2><h3><span id="What_is_partitioning"></span>What is partitioning<span></span></h3><p>Partitioning is the operation of dividing the block device into logical block devices called partitions. It is the first operation to do before we can use the disk.</p><p>To list all disks and partitions present on the system, use the command:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">lsblk</pre><p><img width="880" height="286" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w"></p><p><code>lsblk</code> shows a clear tree structure of disks and their partitions. Also, the “type” column of the output indicates whether the line represents a disk, partition, or LVM. (LVM type is an advanced storage scheme that is discussed at the end)</p><p>There are mainly two partitioning schemes: the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). MBR is a legacy partitioning scheme, but it is still used. It is limited to a maximum disk size of 2 TiB. GPT partitioning is preferred because it breaks the limit of the 2 TiB disks and introduces other enhancements.</p><h3><span id="How_to_create_a_partition"></span>How to create a partition<span></span></h3><p>The<code> fdisk</code> command is used to create MBR partitions, while the <code>gdisk</code> command is used to create GPT partitions. Both are interactive commands and are very similar.</p><p>These commands create a partition table on the first few sectors of a disk. (With GPT, the partition table is also backed up at the last few disk sectors).</p><p>This table contains all the information about the partitions. For example, it includes the sector addresses where every partition begins and ends. (A sector is the minimum read/write block size used by disks, it’s usually 512 Bytes).</p><p>Let’s see an example. We have a CentOS VM with a 20 GB disk named <code>sdb</code>. Note that on your machine, the disk name could be different. Make sure to select the right disk.

A partition without a file system can be seen as just a long array of sectors.<code> </code>The filesystem is a logical abstraction layer that enables the creation of a hierarchy of files and directories.</p><p>There are many types of filesystems. The most widely used in Linux are ext4 and xfs. xfs is the default file system on modern Red Hat and CentOS distributions, while Ubuntu uses ext4.</p><h3><span id="Creating_a_Filesystem"></span>Creating a Filesystem<span></span></h3><p>Let’s continue with our example. We will create an xfs file system on the <code>sdb1</code> partition that we have already created. The command to make a filesystem is <code>mkfs</code>. It uses the -t argument to specify the filesystem type.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1</pre><p><img width="979" height="261" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w"></p><h3><span id="Mounting_a_Filesystem"></span>Mounting a Filesystem<span></span></h3><p>After creating the filesystem, we are one more step away from utilizing the partition storage space. That step is mounting.</p><p>Mounting a filesystem is the operation of linking the filesystem created on top of a partition to the system’s file hierarchy. It includes choosing a directory on the file hierarchy to host the filesystem built on the partition. This directory is called a mount point.</p><p>Let’s create a new mount point called “data” and mount the <code>sdb1</code> filesystem under <code>/data</code></p><p>To confirm the success of the mount operation, we can list all the mounted filesystems by using the command below:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkdir /data
mount /dev/sdb1 /data
df -h</pre><p><img width="880" height="365" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w"></p><p>The last line indicates that the filesystem has been mounted under <code>/data</code> directory. Now it can be used to store files. All files created under <code>/data</code> directory are stored in the <code>sdb1</code> partition.</p><p>Note that the xfs file system by default occupies some of the available space as metadata, which explains the used 33MB.</p><p>However, a manually created mount with the mount command does not survive a reboot. In most cases, the mount should last after a reboot. The mount parameters must be written in the file <code>/etc/fstab </code>to mount a partition persistently.</p><p><code>/etc/fstab</code> by default contains all the persistent mounts required by the system. The root user can further add user required mounts. Let’s see the content of this file:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">cat /etc/fstab</pre><p><img width="880" height="281" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w"></p><p>Each line in this file that doesn’t start with the hash character “#” corresponds to a mount, which is automatically created during the boot process. Each line contains 6 fields:</p><ol><li><code>Block device</code>: device file such as <code>/dev/sdb1</code>. Note that other device identifiers such as UUID also exist.</li><li><code>Mount point</code>.</li><li><code>Filesystem type</code>: xfs, ext4, vfat … etc.</li><li><code>Mount options</code>: these options are handed over to the mount command at boot. The value “defaults” is usually selected unless some different mount options are required.</li><li><code>Backup</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem backup at boot or 0 to disable it. The backup is done by the <code>dump</code> utility. Most systems do not come with the dump program installed by default, so this field is usually set to 0.</li><li><code>Filesystem check</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem check at boot or 0 to disable it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		        
<p>On almost every product I’ve worked on, we’ve relied on a core group of active users to steer the development via great feedback and feature ideas. At Shapeways, <strong>most of our highly successful features came directly from our community.</strong> People who love your product are heavily invested in making it better. They will put in the time if you give them the space to do so and take their feedback seriously.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll share how teams have recruited, setup, and ran customer advisory councils (also called a customer advisory boards) that brought us a regular drip feed of high quality feedback. I’ll also share the mistakes we made along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To get the most relevant feedback, pick users who represent your target audience.</li>
<li>PM should start the council and run it for a few months then hand it off once it’s generating high quality feedback.</li>
<li>I recommend group / synchronous (e.g. video calls) sessions so you can ask follow-up questions and other users can chime in with their thoughts.</li>
<li>You should actually listen to their feedback (and implement it). Otherwise they will stop participating.</li>
<li>Bonus points if you can give them early access to features so they feel special (and you get early signal).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why start an advisory council</h2>
<p>As your userbase grows, it becomes very challenging to understand what people actually think about your product. You’ll quickly get to a point where you are relying on data and expensive user research studies just to keep a pulse on what job people are hiring your product for and where it’s falling over. The beauty of an advisory council is that you don’t just get to hear from some of your best users, they’ll gather feedback on your behalf from other community members. It is by far the most effective way to start to get real stories from real users that are passionate about improving your product to meet their needs. I’m not suggesting that it’s the only signal you should care about, but it should be a tool in your toolbox alongside data and formal user studies.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how advisory counciles drove impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/introducing-etsys-2016-seller-advisory/37704589529">Etsy launched their ‘Seller Advisory Board’ in 2016</a> with 15 sellers picked from a pool of 600 applicants and asked them one simple question: “What’s the most important thing to your buyers?” After some deliberation the group agreed: the speed of the website. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCBMxCIgNcw">Video Interview</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Professional-eBay-Sellers/PESA-members-in-eBay-s-Voices-program/gpm-p/7829699">Ebay had a ‘Voices’ program where they fly out power users for a multi-day summit</a> filled with one-hour feedback sessions. Voices members were steering eBay feedback as early as 2000. <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2009/8/1250740707.html">The voices program was closed in 2009</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to start an advisory council</h2>
<p><strong>Identifying your council</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to identify who from your audience should join your council. You should start by defining who your target / mvp audience is and then filtering within that group. If you want to serve pro surfers from Australia, filter your userbase to that group and then look at their activity. <strong>You want users who are active, vocal, and constructive and represent your target audience.</strong> I typically will look at forums or customer service conversations to hand pick the first group. If your product has an interactive format (e.g. a game or a social media app), you should be able to spot folks using your product publicly. You want to avoid users who are constantly negative (they will drown out the voices of those who want to help) and have needs that are drastically different than one you plan to fulfill (e.g. if you are building a consumer 3d printing company for dog tags, you should include cat owners but not enterprise auto manufacturers).</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting members</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to each member and send them a personal e-mail or note. You need to make it clear that you’re handpicking them (so they feel special), that you value their input (so they feel wanted), and that you plan to involve them in the development process (so they feel like a part of the team). It’s important not to set expectations (e.g. we will ship your feature) because there’s a good chance you won’t use their feedback in the timeframe they expect. If you have a specific time commitment in mind or rewards you can offer (see '<a href="#council-love-you">How to get your council to love you</a>' below), make them known upfront. I strongly recommend avoiding any NDA’s if possible. Yes, you’re letting them behind the curtain of the developent process, but you should be able to keep any extreme trade secrets out of the way and you WANT them to tell their friends about how awesome it was to be a part of this. This is a great way to grow via word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting members</strong></p>
<p>Don’t use fancy tools like mailing lists or contact forms to communicate with your council. These make it feel very formal and like they’re just on another mailing list. You want them to feel like part of the team. Either stick to e-mail or use something simple like a Facebook group or Slack channel that facilitates group interaction. Make sure each email sounds personal and use an e-mail address that supports reply-to so they can send you open ended questions or feedback. You’d be surprised how many great ideas start as a random email reply to an event invite.</p>
<p><strong>Who should run the council?</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of upfront decisions that need to be made to ensure that you get good feedback that is useful to the product team. Because of this, I strongly recommend that the PM sets up the council along with any early processes and facilitation. This will ensure that you personally get value from the group. Once the process is humming and you’re regularly getting great feedback, you can hand it off to  I also suggest inviting at least your designer(s) and any eng that are product-minded. It’s more powerful to hear the ideas/feedback directly from the source than for you to proxy their comments.</p>
<h2>How to run the advisory council</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve chosen your council and they’ve agreed to help. Now what do you actually do together?</p>
<p><strong>Structure and cadence</strong></p>
<p>There are a few options for how you run your council. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group vs. 1:1 setting</li>
<li>Synchronous vs. asynchronous</li>
<li>Scheduled vs. ad hoc</li>
<li>Video vs text</li>
<li>Structured vs unstructured</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/gather-great-feedback-from-power-users/lebowski.jpg">
<p><strong>I’ve found that getting as close to ‘a group of people sitting in the room shooting the shit’ as possible is key.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend a lightly structured synchronous group discussion over video. This allows you to facilitate in realtime and keep the vibe lighthearted (so it doesn’t feel like work) but still dig into meaty questions and hear multiple perspectives. To make this work, you’ll need to schedule time in advance and have a rough set of questions you want to cover as a starting point. You’ll also need to make sure that your team knows the ground rules: Can anyone ask questions? Are certain topics off limits? How do we talk about what’s in development right now?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating the discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the discussion begins, people will look to you to lead it. Treat this like leading a meeting and assume that you need to drive the majority of the conversation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the meeting with a loose agenda (e.g. “We will share a few recent feature developments to get your thoughts, we’ll then open the floor for Q&amp;A, we’ll leave 10 mins for you to ask questions”)</li>
<li>Make it clear when you’re calling on specific people vs when you want anyone to speak</li>
<li>Develop a protocol like ‘hand raising’ but online and try to enforce it. Many community members are going to be introverted and will get drowned out by the few talkative ones. Give everyone space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important part here is the Q&amp;A. You should come armed with a set of questions way too long for you to ever get through. They should typically have open ended answers (like most user research questions) and be very explicit. Try not to hand wave like “If we built a feature that kinda let you sorta do X, would you use it?” Instead focus on specific questions related to their workflow, their problems, and how they use your product.</p>
<p>One of the best questions I’ve asked is “What step of your workflow takes the longest and why?” <strong>(because it led to specific bottlenecks in our app that we could optimize)</strong> and one of the worst questions I’ve asked is “What is the one feature you want more than anything?” <strong>(because you will get a bunch of random not-thoughtful responses).</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-interviewing-customers-the-right-way-from-twitters-ex-vp-product/">Michael Sippy, VP Product at Twitter, keeps his sessions laser focused on problems</a>: <em>“The point is that we’re supposed to be solving a problem for people, and understanding that problem on a really fundamental level,” says Sippey. “Only then can you create a product that actually resonates with the market, and a business that can scale beyond any one feature.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to let the discussion wander, let multiple community members answer the same question, or let them discuss amongst themselves. One member will often be inspired by another and share really helpful insights, so make sure you encourage the group to interact.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with this test, I suggest reading the book '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a>' which gives a step by step guide to asking questions which will get at the pain point/problems customers are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Handling ideas during downtime</strong></p>
<p>When your council isn’t meeting, your community members will still have ideas and feedback. I’ve found that creating an asynchronous forum (e.g. Slack, Facebook group, etc.) can be useful for sporadic ideas so they don’t get lost. Try not to create a contract like “we will respond to your slack in 24h!” but your team does need to respond. If your users feel like they’re throwing their ideas into the ether, they won’t continue to do so. I typically will respond to the async forum once per day and then refer back to it when I am writing questions for the next get-together.</p>
<p>Asynchronous groups are great for getting quick answers to specific quetions. <a href="https://firstround.com/review/start-up-on-the-right-foot-build-a-customer-advisory-board/">TalentBin used their council for small data-driven asks</a>: <em>“We wanted to ask, 'What are the average contract values you guys sell?' and get a quick response, so we chose 10 of the people who have come to all our dinners and who we felt …</em></p></div></div>

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>

<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>

<![CDATA[Hacking Bitcoin Wallets Through JSON Parser Bugs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I didn’t steal any bitcoin. I’ve reported it to the appropriate company and they were shocked at how a bug this simple could have left their wallets empty.
Using different libraries to parse formats like JSON is a bad idea and can expose you to a type of attack that relies on different interpretations of the content by each parser. The microservice pattern introduces the ability to use amalgation of programming languages, but that typically also means differences in parsers.</p>


<p>There’s a lot of love for the microservice pattern and rightfully so. In essence, the microservice pattern tends to lead to greater seperation of privileges and access.
The code that decodes media objects such as videos and images runs in its own microservice, seperating it from the code that can access the database storing your VISA card credentials for example.</p>

<p>But the advocacy for the microservice pattern isn’t only coming from the security perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The microservices architecture allowed Netflix to greatly speed up development and deployment of its platform and services. The company was able to build and test global services on a large scale without impacting the current system and they could quickly rollback if there were problems. The microservices architecture also allowed Netflix to create about 30+ independent engineering teams that could work on different release schedules which helped increase the agility and productivity of the development process. [0]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main driver for organisations to adopt the microservice pattern is to enable faster development and deployments because each team operates more independently.
Every team can pick their own stack (language, libraries, etc..) to use in order to optimize their particular workload.</p>


<p>I consider it to be a better pattern than the monolith if applied correctly.
But the step back is that it may breath new life into an age-old security bug: parser differences.</p>

<p>Here’s my advice for anyone out there building microservices:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSON format leaves gaps for interpretation so make sure that all parsers across all microservices are using a single way to interpret the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don’t quite catch what I’m trying to explain, here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "sendtoaddress",
    "method": "listtransactions",
    "params": [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the <code>method</code> key is presented twice in this JSON payload, but which method of the two will it eventually execute?
This the gap for interpretation that parsers silently deal with. This rather silent assumption can be a great attack vector.</p>

<p>Can we abuse the difference in interpretation by parser X used in microservice 1, which feeds data to parser Y in microservice 2?</p>



<p>This is an actual bugreport that I’ve submitted to a business that operates cryptocurrency nodes that a customer can rent.
But one of their options allows exposing a limited interface of <code>bitcoind</code>, behind a custom firewall that blocks sensitive methods.</p>
<pre><code>USER   ----&gt; [ FIREWALL ]    ----&gt;    [ bitcoind ]
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall microservice maintained a whitelist of methods (<code>getblock</code>, etc..) which was supposed to reject attempts to execute senstitive or malicious commands.
If it passed the filter, it would then pass the <em>COMPLETE</em> payload to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon, which would then execute and return the results.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview to two parsers at play:</p>
<ul>
  <li>firewall: LIFO (OpenResty from <strong>Lua</strong>)</li>
  <li>bitcoind: FIFO (Boost (?) json parser from <strong>C++</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s for example attempt to get the balance of the bitcoind node:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are met with the following response:</p>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I wondered whether we could bypass it, and naturally the first idea that I could come up with was setting it twice.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getblock",
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>
<p>It failed, but luckily I attempted to switch them around, just to be sure.
This time we hit the jackpot!</p>

<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance",
    "method": "getblock"
}
</code></pre>
<p>It returns the getbalance information instead of the error!</p>
<pre><code>{
    "result": 5.35784803,
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall is using a <code>LIFO</code> style parser, which returned <code>getblock</code> as the value of the key <code>method</code>. It accepted the request as valid and forwarded it to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon which uses a <code>FIFO</code> style parser resulting in <code>getbalance</code> to be used as the value of the key <code>method</code></p>

<p>Nice.</p>

      <p>
        Web Monetization is an API that allows websites to request small
        payments from users facilitated by the browser and the user's Web
        Monetization provider.

        <p>
          This specification is a work in progress within the community on the
          best shape it should take. Please see the
          <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/explainer.html">explainer</a> for more info.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specification reflects the desired end-state of the Web Monetization
          APIs as currently anticipated and agreed to between the contributors.
          The specification is being prepared here, in this format, to collect the
          input of the Web community and prepare the work to ultimately follow the
          W3C standards track should it have the necessary support to do so.

    <section id="relation-to-other-protocols">
      <h2>Relation to other protocols</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C have published two payments related APIs for browsers, the
        [[[payment-Request]]] and the [[[Payment-Handler]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason this API is not using the [[[payment-Request]]] directly is
        that Web Monetization is intended for continuous payments rather than
        discrete payments. It is also designed to <em>not</em> have any user
        interaction: It is intended to provide a direct alternative to
        advertisements, rather than an alternative to traditional e-commerce
        checkout methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future, some changes will be required to the [[[payment-Request]]]
        and the [[[Payment-Handler]]] to support Web Monetization. This API
        brings the necessary capabilities to user agents in a manner that can
        integrate with existing payments APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With advertisements, the user agent decides whether to display the ads
        and the user decides whether to engage with the ads. With Web
        Monetization, the user's provider decides whether to pay the site and,
        if so, how much to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Monetization makes use of
        <abbr title="Simple Payment Setup Protocol">SPSP</abbr> on top of
        <abbr title="Interledger Protocol">ILP</abbr>/[[[STREAM]]] to provide a
        high-level way to send money and data, while still providing tremendous
        flexibility.

              The <a>user agent</a> generates a fresh
              <strong>random</strong> UUID (version 4) and uses this as a
              Monetization ID. This MUST be regenerated upon dynamic changes to
              the meta tags and MUST be unique per page load in order to avoid
              user tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>user agent</a> passes these payment details to the user's

            <li>
              The provider resolves the Payment Setup Endpoint and begins to
              pay. The provider MAY be acting from a different machine from the
              user. Cookies and session information MUST NOT be carried with any
              requests made to resolve the Payment Setup Endpoint, with the
              exception of the Monetization ID.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the <code>destination_account</code> and
                  <code>shared_secret</code> fetched from the SPSP query, a
                  [[[STREAM]]] connection is established. A single [[[STREAM]]]
                  is opened on this connection, and a positive SendMax is set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The provider SHOULD set their SendMax high enough that it is
                  never reached, and make payment adjustments by limiting
                  throughput.
                </li>

            <li>
              Once the [[[STREAM]]] connection has fulfilled an ILP packet with
              a non-zero amount, the provider notifies the browser:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> sets
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> to
                  <code>started</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This MUST occur before the `start` event is fired.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This event is a {{ MonetizationStartEvent }}
                  containing the Payment Setup Endpoint and the Monetization ID
                  as properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> also emits a {{ progress }} event from
                  <code>document.monetization</code>, corresponding to this
                  first packet.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment continues for the lifetime of a given meta tag (or
              semantically equivalent)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The provider MAY decide to stop/start payment at any time,
                  e.g. if the user is idle, backgrounds the page, or instructs
                  the browser to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the [[[STREAM]]] connection is severed, the provider will
                  redo the SPSP query to the same Payment Setup Endpoint as
                  before with the same Monetization ID. The <a>user agent</a>
                  MUST NOT re-process the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each time a packet with a non-zero amount is fulfilled, the
                  provider notifies the browser, and the browser emits a
                  {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }}
                  on
                  <code>document.monetization</code>. The event has details of
                  the packet.

                <li>
                  When a stream is closed the
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> MUST be set back to

      <h3 id="payment-handler-flow">Payment Handler Flow</h3>
      <p>
        A provider can be implemented as a Payment Handler supporting the
        'webmonetization' payment method (The payment method specification for
        this payment method is still under development as it is dependant on
        changes to the Payment Handler API that support streaming payments).
        Communication between the browser and the provider would use this flow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After parsing the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set, the browser creates a new
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentrequest-interface">PaymentRequest</a>
          object with the following
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata">PaymentMethodData</a>
          argument.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>        {
          "supportedMethods": "webmonetization",
          "data": {
            "paymentPointer": "&lt;payment pointer parsed from meta tag&gt;"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a>user agent</a> calls <code>.show()</code> on this
          PaymentRequest, triggering the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/">PaymentHandler</a>
          for <code>webmonetization</code>. This PaymentHandler is how the
          browser communicates to the provider.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The return value of <code>.show()</code> MUST return a Promise,
              and must also implement the {{ EventTarget }}
              interface. The provider will emit
              {{ MonetizationStartEvent }} and
              {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }} events from this Promise to
              communicate to the browser when payment occurs. The Promise MUST
              NOT resolve, because Web Monetization continues for the entire
              lifetime of a given meta tag. The Promise MAY reject if there is
              an error preventing the …</li></ul></li></ul></section></div>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Document management is a core requirement for all sorts of regulated institutions - finance, telecom, healthcare, government and others. These institutions need to manage and retain an ever growing number of documents and regulatory guidelines often require these documents to be stored for a very long term (7-10 years). <br></p><p>Take for example, KYC (Know Your Customer) documents. Anyone starting a relationship with a financial institution needs to provide KYC documents. These documents are then stored with the institution as long as the relationship exists and even beyond that for several years. <br></p><p>Traditional document management systems are simply no longer able to provide the scale, cost efficiency and reliability that such use cases require. This has triggered the move to modern, cloud native solutions. <br></p><p>In this document we go through various challenges with traditional document management solutions and then look at the next generation solutions that some of our customers have developed.</p><h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2><h3 id="closed-monolith">Closed Monolith</h3><p>Traditional document management systems are monolithic, closed systems. This means IT teams can not take advantage of new paradigms like segregation of concerns (i.e. microservices), API access, disaggregating storage and compute, among others. Adding features or scaling such systems simply means paying for new licenses. <br></p><p>Additionally, these systems are built as blackboxes with little to no extensionsibility. So, the IT teams have to work around these tools to achieve their intended workflow.</p><h3 id="limited-system-integration-capabilities">Limited System Integration Capabilities</h3><p>Traditional Document management systems are inherently closed, with little to no API integration to plug into external systems, or plugin other tools. This creates a vendor lock-in, higher the number of documents a system manages, the tougher it becomes to get rid of the system.<br></p><p>This is orthogonal to the modern approach of native API integrations with other systems to build powerful features by composition of tools and technologies..</p><h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3><p>Typical document management systems use databases combined with file systems. Both databases and file systems are well known to have difficulties in handling large data volumes. The scalability challenges in the underlying database and file system, invariably show up as the number of documents grows. <br></p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Documents are essentially unstructured blobs of varying formats and sizes, ideal for object storage platforms like MinIO. With seamless scalability, API integration with major modern data platforms to enable search, audit logs and other important features, MinIO fits right in. <br></p><p>Here we propose a highly scalable approach to build a modern, cloud-native document store.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cRg4-T5csoo6bC4Tu3wJgsPN8Q5gtYPInRokwDfZTQOOxLl3DCXtf6LA__Wzv-8ZMcCGjZAvJy_x367ASBi0QbEtd-BtiiqJ7xI3a7vW8c3NQOQFw5Vy72Jamzg9x2jKdsO8ueqm" alt=""></figure><p>Let’s take a closer look at the architecture, its components and their interaction:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Modern JS based frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte provide a great starting point for building the frontend for enterprise applications like this. Since all these frameworks are API driven, it is quite easy to integrate these with backend, special purpose applications like Identity and Access Management, DB, Object Storage among others. <br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Text/Metadata Search: </strong></strong></strong>A<strong> </strong>key requirement for a document management system is to allow searching the whole document catalog for specific documents. This search may be based on document metadata (like owner-name, owner-id, document-type etc), or even based on contents of the document itself. Either way, any document metadata can be sent to text search tools like <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic</a>. <p>Essentially, MinIO can be <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide.html">configured to send out event notifications</a> (with object metadata) to the text search platform. This way, the search platform then has all the document metadata and a link to the actual document in MinIO. The frontend can then send the user query the text search platform and fetch the relevant document.</p><p>Apart from simple text search, the object data and metadata from MinIO can be fed to Machine Learning pipelines as explained in <a href="https://blog.min.io/hyper-scale-machine-learning-with-minio-and-tensorflow/">this blog post</a>. This opens up opportunities to analyse and understand not only the metadata but also the actual documents, opening up business insights for the teams to leverage.</p></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Webhook: </strong></strong></strong>Customer documents are secure and private objects, it is very important for the compliance or audit teams to ensure that a detailed audit log of the document is maintained. <p>MinIO can be <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/logging#audit-targets">integrated with various target systems</a> to send out audit logs. MinIO webhook integration allows seamless integration with any platform that supports webhooks, while removing dependency from message queue type systems. </p><p>Additionally, MinIO ensures that events missed while the remote webook target is offline are delivered later, as and when the target comes back online. Events pending for delivery are stored securely on MinIO, making sure that the audit log doesn’t miss any entry.</p></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Object Storage:</strong> This is the backbone of the whole system. It provides scalable, persistent storage for documents (and their multiple versions), related metadata, user-access policies among other information. There are several unique advantages with a MinIO object storage vs. generic or legacy solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ILM based Tiering &amp; Archival: Lifecycle management feature allows automatically moving data from one storage tier to another (e.g. Warm/Hot to Archival) or even expire certain objects after they are no longer required.	This allows IT teams to ensure that only the frequently accessed documents are kept in the fast tier, while the other, infrequently accessed documents are moved to archival tier which potentially uses cost effective hardware allowing almost limitless storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active-Active replication: High availability and protection from data loss is critical for document management systems. MinIO Active-Active replication comes in handy here. Users can configure the MinIO cluster to replicate objects to a remote MinIO cluster. This means IT teams can leverage a 2 DC approach to ensure data is safe from a complete DC failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohasset certified object locking &amp; object retention: MinIO object retention and locking capabilities are certified by Cohasset. This means IT teams can be sure that MinIO software is complaint to the the appropriate regulator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document versions: MinIO object versioning allows seamless storage of multiple versions of a document. This  maps very well to real life situations where customers may need to provide new documents due to issues in older versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><div><p>Document management is not immune to the advancements in cloud technologies, microservices and API-driven development. Having said that, compliance, particularly regulatory compliance does cause innovation to lag. The trend we are seeing today, however, is that major financial institutions are moving toward a model where object storage serves as the foundational element in KYC architectures. </p><p>Modern object storage is scalable, resilient, performant and in the case of MinIO, certified for object locking and retention. </p><p>We think this modern architecture is the optimal approach for regulated institutions like finance, telecom, healthcare, government. </p><p>And this is why all ten of the largest banks in the US run MinIO and eight of the ten largest banks in Europe run MinIO. </p><p>To learn more, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@min.io">hello@min.io</a> and we can go into more detail than we can publicly.</p></div>

  <p>Dear Professor,</p>

  <p>I’m quite confused about the mark that came out on moodle on May.29th. I recalled getting 90 100 100 respectively for those three separate tasks during the face to face assessment, but the final mark turns out to be only 70. I remembered that the uploaded code check is said to be only a precaution check and wouldn’t have much effect on the final mark.</p>

  <p>Besides, I’m also baffled about that ‘Suspect of copying’ comment. I can assure you that I wrote all the code on my own without any help from other people or any unauthorized reference to other people’s work. Java Programming module is my favorite among all second-year courses. A lot of my time and effort is dedicated to these assignments in order to make the code as perfect as possible, and I have enjoyed every second of it. Therefore, it really hurts when I’m being regarded as suspect of copying. I’m writing this email to humbly ask for more clarification on this feedback as well as the reason why such a low score is received.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Shengwei [redacted]</p>

  <p>Dear Shengwei,</p>

  <p>The mark was decided by your marker Tom [redacted] (cc’ed).
It is true that the lab examination mark was 90 but then your
marker decided to drop to 70 upon examining your code.</p>

  <p>The key reason your source files have as first line
“package com.nicolaspepe;” which certainly raises a few eyebrows
re possible copying.</p>

  <p>Hi George,</p>

  <p>I just had a look again and since there is no other student called Nicholas Pepe, and, since I have just now realised that Nicholas Pepe is a professional footballer for Arsenal, I am willing to believe that the package name is due to the student typing in a random name when configuring the IDE, and not a result of cheating. I’ll have another look at the code and let you know.</p>

  <p>Sorry about this!</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Hi Shengwei,</p>

  <p>I’ve just had another look at your assignment. The code was generally good, well commented and demonstrated an understanding of polymorphism. You should avoid using generic classes such as Object in method declarations (use ListNode instead), but otherwise the code is fine.</p>

  <p>The reason you were given a low mark is because of the line “package com.nicholaspepe”, which implied to me that the work was plagiarised from another student - generally package names contain the person or company who wrote the code (for instance, com.johnsmith, or com.ucl.ee). However if you can explain why you have called your package “com.nicholaspepe” then I will review the mark.</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Dear [Tom],</p>

  <p>Back in August 2019 when I started learning Java, I took an online Java tutorial, saying that you can name the package with your own name or the name of a corporation. As a fan of Arsenal Football Club (the one located in North London Islington), I was really pumped at that time with the club’s record-breaking signing “Nicolas Pepe”, an Ivorian coast winger from the French Top Division. So, I decided to improvise a little bit and name my first package on IntelliJ as “com.nicolaspepe”.</p>

  <p>Since all my Java projects in year 2 are created under this package, the package name appearing at the start of all assignments is thus “com.nicolaspepe”. You can have a check on my assignment 2 code and the package name is still Nicolas Pepe. I’ve enclosed some more information regarding this footballer, and I hope that it’s useful in convincing you of my innocence.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Shengwei [redacted]</p>

Invest in your sleep</h3><p>It is insane how life changing it was to understand how sleep impacts our brain power, mental and physical health, mood and simply our wellbeing. This was one of the biggest <strong>side effects of the pandemic</strong>, our sleep quality dropped really low, some of us to the level of insomnia. (Stress depression and anxiety definitely donâ€™t help). It is even more insane to see how little we prioritize and invest in our sleep routine and quality. Hereâ€™s what I recommend to help you change that:</p><ol><li><strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Why we sleep</a>. The insights will challenge your assumptions and hopefully ensure you sleep better. Self awareness is the secret foundation behind any new habit forming.</li><li><strong>Invest</strong> in a good Mattress if possible. Hereâ€™s my top pick, <a href="http://eightsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Eight Sleep:</a>, a smart mattress to help you sleep better. A good pillow also makes the difference.</li><li>Finally, <strong>start </strong>a sleep routine. This has been life changing for me. One good way to kick this out is through the bedtime story with the<a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Calm</a> app. It will help you distress, relax and breathe. This is your daily meditation companion. It is crucial however to find what works best for you. <em>Most importantly, plan for it like you would plan for a meeting or for cooking a meal. Have your ingredients (besides the mattress and the pillow, things like the PJs that you are comfy in, the eye mask, the oils that can help you relax like vetiver and lavender and the good night book or meditation routine that works. </em><strong><em>Avoid screens at all costs</em></strong><em>).</em></li></ol><p><img alt="Collage for why we sleep, eight sleep, and calm app" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGqsztjMvXN3g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1609280521619?e=1616025600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9MTE2g20uCMd5Er98xtV8JP4c6x9-MoO4EViNnfh1d4" src="//:0"></p><h3>2. Build new sustainable good habits, â€œWFH adaptedâ€�&nbsp;</h3><p>Stuck in lockdown for most of this year was a showcase of human resilience. Achieving work/life balance proved to be a drag. That's understandable, especially since most of us tried remote for the first time.</p><p>I am a firm believer that remote work along with digital wellbeing is a muscle you need to cultivate and develop every single day but you can't do that if you don't have the 360 degree view from start to finish. Hereâ€™s your recipe for building and sustaining your good habits.</p><p>Learning something new is the easy part.

This is the one thing technology made us opt in without checking. We became, by default, reactive rather than proactive to everything around us. Notifications are the worst form of distractions. They deplete your attention span and rewire your brain to be dependent, setting the stage for a true addiction. They are detrimental to your digital wellbeing.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gloria Markâ€™s research</a> shows that It takes us 23 min on average to refocus after each interruption and that the more interruptions we get externally, the more we train bad habits, like training us to interrupt ourselves&nbsp;(we self-interrupt every 3 min and a half).&nbsp;</p><p>â†’ Understand distractions, own them and rewire your brain around them by reading&nbsp;Nir Eyal's latest best-seller <a href="http://geni.us/Indistractable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Indistractible :</a> it is a powerful research driven&nbsp;handbook filled with amazing insights on productivity and digital wellbeing.(If you are more of a listener, you can check <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/945931/5038484-the-art-of-being-indistractible-with-nir-eyal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">my podcast episode </a>where I interview Nir about his book).</p><h2>3. Implement process and&nbsp;tooling to support yourself&nbsp;</h2><p>Everyone who knows me would certainly testify that I am a process freak. The thing is, when people hear the word â€œprocessâ€�, they, for whatever reason, feel it is something complex or rigid. Yet, it isnâ€™t. It can make your life so much easier. In order to understand why/where you need process and what tool to use to support it, hereâ€™s how you get started:</p><p><strong>ðŸ”œ Schedule an hour of your time on January 2nd</strong> (It is a Saturday so this should be easy:)) and write down your goals for the year, personally and professionally. Letâ€™s, for the sake of this note, pick the following: healthy diet, on time project delivery and balanced life. Then adopt the same approach as the one below for each.</p><p><strong>Example: Healthy diet</strong></p><p><strong><u>Process:</u></strong>&nbsp;1. Create a list of ingredients that you believe are healthy and enjoy, 2. Bookmark a few recipes that you know or want to test out,&nbsp;3. Set a day and time on when you want your grocery shopping done and finally <a href="https://veamly.com/calendar-blocking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">calendar block</a> cooking time and shopping time for the year.</p><p><strong><u>Tool: </u></strong>If you are all about online, use one of the apps: amazon, instacart or your personal favorite and create a saved list that you can re-order with a click. Use an app like evernote to journal your favorite recipes, bookmark them or simply have a list of ideas you can come back to when you donâ€™t know what to cook. (If you are more of an in store shopper, save your grocery list there too).</p><p>Bingo ðŸŽŠ You got your healthy food diet process set ðŸ¤©</p><p>For more about work processes and detailed approaches on how to hack them, check out my <a href="https://docsend.com/view/vd2zkqb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Productivity Hacks ebook</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On that note, I hope you enjoyed this quick read!

January 11, 2021 | https://jbencook.com/numpy-reshape/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jbencook.com/numpy-reshape/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>The NumPy reshape operation changes the shape of an array so that it has a new (but compatible) shape. The rules are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The number of elements stays the same.</li>
  <li>The order of the elements stays the same<a href="https://jbencook.com/numpy-reshape/#notes">[1]</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h3>

<p>Here’s a simple example that takes a 4x4 identity matrix and turns it into an array with shape <code>(2, 8)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>eye</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>)</span>

<span># Expected result
# array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<!--more-->

<p>To understand what’s going on, you can think of reshape as 1) flattening the input array and 2) inserting each element into the output array with new shape. That means, the above operation is equivalent to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>ravel</span><span>(),</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>))</span>

<span># Expected result
# array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://jbencook.com/assets/img/2021/numpy-reshape.jpg" alt="numpy reshape diagram"></p>

<p>Notice a couple things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The number of elements doesn’t change.</li>
  <li>Elements are selected in row-major order: left to right, top to bottom<a href="#notes">[2]</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowing that the order won’t change is important because it means you can go backwards. No matter what shape you convert an array to, you can always recover the original array by passing in the new array with the original shape:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>).</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>).</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>)</span>

<span># Expected result
# array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>

<p>The reshape operation can be used as a top-level function <code>np.reshape()</code> or as a method on an array <code>.reshape()</code>. Let’s start by looking at the function.</p>

<p>You should pay attention to two arguments for <code>np.reshape()</code>. An array-like input, called <code>a</code>, and an integer or tuple of integers specifying the output shape, called <code>newshape</code>.</p>

<p>Remember, we can’t change the number of elements in the output array, so the product of <code>newshape</code> has to be the same as the total number of elements in <code>a</code> (with one exception described in the next paragraph). Otherwise, you’ll get a <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

<h4 id="unknown-size">Unknown size</h4>

<p>The exception to this rule, is that one of the dimensions in <code>newshape</code> can be -1, which roughly means “unknown size”<a href="#notes">[3]</a>. As long as the rest of the <code>newshape</code> tuple is set, NumPy can figure out the unknown dimension since the total number of elements can’t change.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>

#        [0., 0.],
#        [0., 1.],
#        [0., 0.],
#        [0., 0.],

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we tell NumPy that the first axis should have size 8 and we want to fill in the next axis with whatever size we need, which in this case is 2.</p>

<h4 id="method-arguments">Method arguments</h4>

<p>When you call <code>.reshape()</code> as a method on an array, the first argument is implicitly <code>self</code> and you only pass in the new shape. One usage quirk to be aware of: <code>newshape</code> can be passed in as separate arguments:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>)</span>

<span># Expected result
# array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a nice shortcut, but it’s not a requirement. You can pass in <code>newshape</code> as a tuple to the method as well (e.g. <code>.reshape((-1, 8))</code>).</p>

<h4 id="memory">Memory</h4>

<p>There’s one important gotcha to watch out for when reshaping an array. Whenever possible, NumPy will create a new view of the array with the requested shape instead of copying all of the elements. This is analogous to using <code>.ravel()</code> to flatten an array instead of <code>.flatten()</code>.</p>

<p>The benefit of returning a view is that the operation is faster and more memory-efficient. But you have to know that this might happen because modifying the new array in-place will update the original:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>eye</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>x</span>

<span># Expected result
# array([[2., 1., 1., 1.],
#        [1., 2., 1., 1.],
#        [1., 1., 2., 1.],
#        [1., 1., 1., 2.]])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the input elements are non-contiguous, <code>.reshape()</code> is not able to update a view. Instead, it makes a copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>eye</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>T</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>x</span>

<span># array([[1., 0., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 1., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This silent difference can cause sneaky bugs if you’re not paying attention. So if you need to know whether you have a view or a copy, you can use the <code>np.shares_memory()</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>eye</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>y1</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>y2</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>T</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span># y1 is a view
</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>shares_memory</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y1</span><span>)</span>

<span># Expected result
# True
</span>
<span># y2 is a copy
</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>shares_memory</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y2</span><span>)</span>

<span># Expected result
# False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>A common use case for reshaping an array (or a tensor if you’re working in one of the deep learning frameworks) is flattening the output of the last convolutional layer in an image classifier so that you can send it to a <a href="https://jbencook.com/keras-dense">linear layer</a>. Fortunately, TensorFlow and PyTorch both have a top-level <code>reshape()</code> function with the same API as NumPy.</p>

<p>Say you have a tensor with shape <code>(batch_size, n_row, n_col, n_features)</code> and you want it to have shape <code>(batch_size, n_row * n_col * n_features)</code>. Just use the reshape operation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>torch</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>randn</span><span>((</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>reshape</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)).</span><span>shape</span>

<span># Expected result
# torch.Size([4, 300])
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code is almost identical in TensorFlow. Keras also provides <a href="https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/reshape/">Reshape</a> and <a href="https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/flatten/">Flatten</a> layers in case you don’t want to mess with the actual operation.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Ok, this is not strictly true. The actual rule is: the order will be whatever you specify, which defaults to <code>order='C'</code>, which means “C-like” order a.k.a. row-major order. If you have a very good reason to change the array ordering in NumPy, then do so carefully. Otherwise, avoid it. The TensorFlow and PyTorch reshape operations (<code>tf.reshape()</code> and <code>torch.reshape()</code> respectively) don’t expose this parameter. In NumPy, I follow this convention and ignore it.</li>
  <li>More generally, the last index changes the fastest. Since a matrix has shape <code>(n_rows, n_cols)</code>, the columns change first. If you have an array with shape <code>(a, b, c)</code>, the <code>c</code> axis will change first, followed by <code>b</code> then <code>a</code>.</li>
  <li>The use of -1 to mean “unknown size” is a bit of overloading. Typically, in the context of slicing and indexing, -1 means “the last element”.</li>
</ol>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty">Zutty</a> is the best X terminal emulator you have never heard of. It
employs a radically simple, massively parallel rendering algorithm to
completely offload the work of drawing the terminal screen to the GPU.
This is quite different from how other terminal emulators operate,
GPU-accelerated ones included. You can read more on <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2020/11/How-Zutty-works">How Zutty works</a>.</p>

<p>Here I am interested in comparing Zutty to some alternatives: partly
those that are well-known and have been around for many decades, but
also (and especially) to other, newer programs similar to Zutty in
that they also employ some kind of GPU-based rendering.</p>

<p>The comparison will be unashamedly <em>biased</em>: as the author of Zutty, I
have a natural tendency to select criteria that makes Zutty look good.
At the same time, I will try to make a fair comparison based on
quantifiable metrics. Please note: I am in no way trying to convey
that Zutty is altogether superior to any of the programs mentioned
here; all of the programs are useful to at least some people and they
have been written by obviously talented and dedicated programmers. I
do not believe in reducing ranking among programs to a one-dimensional
metric (a.k.a, “which program is better/best”), as the answer is, in
nearly all aspects, “it depends”. The standard disclaimer also
applies: terminals are notoriously complex beasts and my findings with
any of the terminals might be due to “other factors” (including my own
mistakes).</p>

<p>That said, I will aim to show that Zutty provides a compelling set of
features at a high level of correctness and excellent performance
characteristics. Compared to existing GPU-accelerated terminal
emulators, Zutty runs on a wider range of graphics hardware by virtue
of only requiring OpenGL ES as opposed to “desktop” OpenGL, and its
resource demands are otherwise minimal. All this is provided by a
relatively tiny codebase.</p>

<p>Zutty has been written from scratch, and while doing so, I have <em>not</em>
consulted the implementation of any other terminal emulator. As a
result, Zutty has a clean-room codebase unencumbered by historical
baggage. The pervasive cross-pollination observed across the terminal
emulator ecosystem is not necessarily a problem in itself, but fresh
blood certainly makes for better diversity than endless recycling.</p>

<p>At the same time, one could argue that Zutty is not for everyone: it
runs on Linux only (at the moment) and is tied to the X client API (if
only for creating a window and receiving events). It has relatively
little in the “fancy features” department, even though it is quite
configurable (for the things I care about, anyway). But it also has a
list of missing features: things that should eventually be supported,
but are currently missing.</p>

<p>Comparison criteria will be grouped into three broad categories:
Features and correctness; performance and resource usage; and finally
miscellaneous (developer-oriented) metrics.</p>



<p>All programs are actively developed with publicly accessible codebases
and recent releases. Sorted in decreasing order of popularity/ubiquity
(no science here, just my gut feeling):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a>: The standard
terminal emulator for the X Window System, the venerable xterm is
the mother of all X terminal emulators. Carrying several decades of
historical baggage, but at the same time complete with support for
(almost) any terminal-related standard or feature. Runs on every
platform supported by the X Window System.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">gnome-terminal</a>: The
GNOME Terminal Emulator, as its name suggests, is the official
terminal emulator provided by the GNOME project. It is released
under the GNU GPLv3 or later. Gnome terminal uses the
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal/VTE">VTE</a> library under the
hood, which places it on equal footing with Xfce-terminal,
Terminator, and a long list of others. Enormous installed base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html">urxvt</a>: Also
known as rxvt-unicode, a Unicode-oriented reboot of rxvt, itself a
dumbed down clone of xterm. Boasts features such as “crash-free”,
“flicker-free”, using much less memory than xterm, customizability
with embedded Perl, etc. Still widely used and referred to, and has
a reputation of being fast. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>: A “simple terminal” provided by
the “suckless” project. It is released under the X/MIT license.
This program expressly positions itself as minimal (bloat-free)
and highly performant. Configuration requires recompilation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a>: The first
GPU-accelerated terminal emulator to achieve widespread adoption,
famously claiming itself to be “the fastest terminal emulator
in existence” (more on this claim below). Written in Rust, a new
language for systems programming. Runs on several UNIX-like
platforms. Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>: Another GPU-accelerated
terminal written in C and Python. Has its own framework for
extensions written in Python. Runs on Linux and MacOS. Advertises
itself as a “feature full [<em>sic</em>], cross-platform, <em>fast</em>, GPU
based” terminal emulator. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty">Zutty</a>: GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written by this
author, aimed at low-end (low-cost, low-energy) systems with
hardware support for OpenGL ES 3.1. Written in C++, runs on
Linux. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>My regular low-energy home desktop system is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Tinker_Board">ASUS TinkerBoard
S</a> with an RK3288
32-bit SoC containing an ARM Mali T760 GPU providing hardware support
for OpenGL ES 3.2. Unfortunately, not all tested programs are capable
of running on this (otherwise quite capable) system: Alacritty and
Kitty require “desktop” OpenGL and thus cannot run on this board.  On
the other hand, Zutty runs perfectly fine and is my primary terminal
here.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this article, my test system is a six year old
Lenovo laptop with a 4-core i5-4210U CPU and an Intel Haswell Mobile
chipset with integrated graphics, providing hardware support for
OpenGL ES 3.1 and OpenGL 3.0. Contrary to my low-energy desktop, this
is a 64-bit system. The software is Debian Buster (current stable); I
use the i3 window manager, and the configured locale is <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>.</p>

<p>All terminal window screenshots linked into this article were produced
by the <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty/doc/HACKING.html#Automated%20testing">automated testing</a>
toolkit of Zutty. As documented, this toolkit is capable of evaluating
other terminals as well as Zutty, and to collect the screenshots and
data presented below, I relied on exactly this capability.</p>



<p>The below table summarizes essential features of each tested terminal.</p>

<p>The value of <code>TERM</code> within the shell started by the terminal conveys
the terminal’s type to programs being run in it. For terminals
providing their own terminfo entries, the table links to that data as
well as a diff to the quasi-standard <code>xterm-256color</code> used by others.</p>

<p>Device attributes (VT self-identification) are what the terminal
proclaims about itself when queried. This is revealed by <a href="https://invisible-island.net/vttest/vttest.html">VTTEST</a> menu
items 6.4 and 6.5, and the links PDA (primary device attributes) and
SDA (secondary device attributes) lead to the corresponding screen
captures of each program.</p>

<p>All established programs were tested with their version present in
Debian Buster (current stable). The latest stable release of Kitty was
manually installed, as was Alacritty. Alas, Alacritty stopped
releasing .deb files, so I tested their last version for which a .deb
was released.</p>

<h2 id="vt-support-levels">VT support levels</h2>

<p>The above table is sorted by descending level of proclaimed terminal
support. The difference between implementing a VT400 or VT500 terminal
(provided the implementations are correct) is relatively
inconsequential. The same cannot be said of the gap between these and
VT220-level terminals. Programs running in a less capable virtual
terminal must sometimes use longer series of basic escape sequences to
achieve the results of a fewer number of more modern ones. For
example, the DECLRMM control sequence (set left-right margin mode) is
available from the VT420 and up, and will be used to restrict
scrolling to the active part of two horizontally split <code>tmux</code> panes. On
less capable terminals, <code>tmux</code> is forced to perform more work to
achieve the same result. This is quite similar to how extended
instructions on modern CPUs allow machine code to be more efficient
than code compiled for an older machine. In other words, not
implementing a modern VT variant goes directly counter to greater
efficiency. And there is yet another downgrade from VT220 to those
terminals that only claim to support VT100/VT102.</p>

<p>It is surprising how unambitious the newer terminals Alacritty and
Kitty are in this regard. I would have hoped that new, supposedly
state-of-the-art entrants would take the effort to add support for
modern VT standards. Switching from xterm to Alacritty (or any other
modern terminal) should not be a major downgrade.</p>

<h3 id="side-note-on-vt52-support">Side note on VT52 support</h3>

<p>On the low end of the VT level hierarchy sits the VT52. This is purely
of academic interest in 2020, but still: there is technically no way
for a “VT100 or better” terminal to be standards-compliant and <em>not</em>
support VT52 (as the VT100 spec contains a sequence for downgrading
into VT52 mode). Also, given that VT52 is a (small) subset of what the
VT100 is capable of, any reasonably well structured implementation
should find it easy to fit this in with a minimal amount of additional
code. However, of all the terminals included in this test, only xterm,
urxvt and Zutty implement VT52 mode.</p>

<h2 id="term-settings">TERM settings</h2>

<p>Another problem area for newer entrants into the terminal ecosystem is
the value of TERM set in the shell. This is a bit of a catch-22 for
all programs that are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Next, stretch your neck and chin. Begin by placing your hand on your chest as though you’re pulling down on your skin. Next, raise your chin and put your jaw toward the ceiling for a second or so. You should feel the muscles that you’re engaging. Using one-second intervals, move your chin back and forth for 20 seconds.</p>

        <p><span>evolution</span></p><p>Often considered the world's oddest mammal, Australia’s beaver-like, duck-billed platypus exhibits an array of bizarre characteristics: it lays eggs instead of giving birth to live babies, sweats milk, has venomous spurs and is even equipped with 10 sex chromosomes. Now, an international team of researchers led by University of Copenhagen has conducted a unique mapping of the platypus genome and found answers regarding the origins of a few of its stranger features.

<p>It lays eggs, but nurses, it is toothless, has a venomous spur, has webbed feet, fur that glows and has 10 sex chromosomes. Ever since Europeans discovered the platypus in Australia during the late 1700’s, the quirky, duck-billed, semiaquatic creature has baffled scientific researchers.</p>
<p>Modern day researchers are still trying to understand how the platypus — often considered to be the world's oddest mammal — got to be so unique. Their understandings have now advanced, to a great degree. For the first time, an international team of researchers, led by University of Copenhagen biologists, has mapped a complete platypus genome. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03039-0">The study has been published in the scientific journal,</a><em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03039-0"> Nature</a>.</em></p>
<p>"The complete genome has provided us with the answers to how a few of the platypus’ bizarre features emerged. At the same time, decoding the genome for platypus is important for improving our understanding of how other mammals evolved — including us humans. It holds the key as to why we and other eutheria mammals evolved to become animals that give birth to live young instead of egg-laying animals," explains Professor Guojie Zhang of the Department of Biology.</p>
<p>The platypus belongs to an ancient group of mammals — monotremes — which existed millions of years prior to the emergence of any modern-day mammal.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the platypus belongs to the Mammalia class. But genetically, it is a mixture of mammals, birds and reptiles. It has preserved many of its ancestors’ original features — which probably contribute to its success in adapting to the environment they live in," says Professor Zhang.</p>
<h2>Lays eggs, sweats milk and has no teeth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One of the platypus' most unusual characteristics is that, while it lays eggs, it also has mammary glands used to feed its babies, not through nipples, but by milk — which is sweat from its body.</p>
<p>During our own evolution, we humans lost all three so-called vitellogenin genes, each of which is important for the production of egg yolks. Chickens on the other hand, continue to have all three. The study demonstrates that platypuses still carry one of these three vitellogenin genes, despite having lost the other two roughly 130 million years ago. The platypus continues to lay eggs by virtue of this one remaining gene. This is probably because it is not as dependent on creating yolk proteins as birds and reptiles are, as platypuses produce milk for their young.</p>
<p>In all other mammals, vitellogenin genes have been replaced with casein genes, which are responsible for our ability to produce casein protein, a major component in mammalian milk. The new research demonstrates that the platypus carries casein genes as well, and that the composition of their milk is thereby quite similar to that of cows, humans and other mammals.</p>
<p>"It informs us that milk production in all extant mammal species has been developed through the same set of genes derived from a common ancestor which lived more than 170 million years ago — alongside the early dinosaurs in the Jurassic period," says Guojie Zhang.</p>
<p>Another trait that makes the platypus so unique is that, unlike the vast majority of mammals, it is toothless. Although this monotremes’ nearest ancestors were toothed, the modern platypus is equipped with two horn plates that are used to mash food. The study reveals that the platypus lost its teeth roughly 120 million years ago, when four of the eight genes responsible for tooth development disappeared.</p>
<h2>Only animal with 10 sex chromosomes</h2>
<p>Yet another platypus oddity investigated by the researchers was how their sex is determined. Both humans and every other mammal on Earth have two sex chromosomes that determine sex – the X and Y chromosome system in which XX is female and XY is male. The monotremes, however, including our duck-billed friends from Down Under, have 10 sex chromosomes, with five Y and five X chromosomes.</p>
<p>Thanks to the near-complete chromosomal level genomes, researchers can now suggest that these 10 sex chromosomes in the ancestors of the monotremes were organized in a ring form which was later broken away into many small pieces of X and Y chromosomes. At the same time, the genome mapping reveals that the majority of monotreme sex chromosomes have more in common with chickens than with humans. But what it shows, is an evolutionary link between mammals and birds.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>PLATYPUS FACTS </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The platypus is endemic to eastern Australia and Tasmania. It is a protected species and classified by the IUCN as near-threatened.</li>
<li>Among the reasons why platypuses are considered mammals: they have mammary glands, grow hair and have three bones in their middle ears. Each trait helps to define a mammal.</li>
<li>The platypus belongs to the mammalian order monotreme, so named because monotremes use a singular opening for urination, defecation and sexual reproduction.</li>
<li>The animal is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time hunting for insects and shellfish in rivers.</li>
<li>Its distinctive beak is filled with electrical sensors which are used to locate prey in muddy river beds.</li>
<li>The male platypus has a venomous spur behind each of its hind legs. The venom is poisonous enough to kill a dog and is deployed when males fight for territory.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2020-0027">Another 2020 study</a> demonstrated that platypus fur is fluorescent. The animal’s brown fur reflects a blue-green color when placed under UV light.&nbsp;</li>

        <h2>ABOUT THE STUDY</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>Advanced gene sequencing technology that combines numerous cutting-edge methods has allowed the research team to map a near-complete genome at the chromosomal level from both the platypus and its cousin, the echidna— the only two currently living types of monotreme animals. The gene data fills in 90 percent of the gaps in previous genetic mappings. Over 96% of the genome sequences are placed in the chromosomes now.</li>
<li>The researchers have compared the monotreme genes and genomes from chickens, humans, rats, Tasmanian devils and lizards.</li>
<li>In addition to Yang Zhou (lead author) and Guojie Zhang of the University of Copenhagen, the research was carried out by, among others: Linda Shearwin-Whyatt of The University of Adelaide (Australia) and Jing Li of Zhejiang University (China). A complete list of the authors can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03039-0">the research article</a>.</li>
<li>The study has just been published in the prestigious scientific journal,<em> Nature</em>: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03039-0">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03039-0</a></li>

  <p>There is nothing like having your application in production. You and your users will find bugs, surprising behavior, and new challenges in ways that simply don’t happen in any other environment. Consider the initial period of time after launch — hours or days depending on when demand stabilizes — as sacrosanct, an opportunity to focus on operations, system availability, and providing reliable service to your users.</p>

<p>Ad Hoc has been a part of many high-profile launches in government, starting with coming in to help rescue the early troubled launch of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a>, to subsequent, increasingly smoother open enrollment periods for that same website, to the transformation of <a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA.gov</a>, among others. We’ve seen first-hand the stakes of getting launch wrong, and the value in doing it right.</p>

<p>In order to properly prepare for launch, take the following hard-won experiential advice into account.</p>

        	<p><em>
          		Posted on 10 January 2021.</em></p><p>Property-Based Testing (PBT) sees increasing use in industry, but lags
significantly behind in education. Many academics have never even
heard of it. This isn’t surprising; computing education still hasn’t
come to terms with even basic software testing,
<a href="https://blog.brownplt.org/2020/01/11/examplar.html">even when it can address pedagogic problems</a>.
So this lag is predictable.</p>



<p>But even people who want to use it often struggle to find good
examples of it.
Reversing a list
<a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1140615803752079360">drives people to drink</a>,
and math examples
<a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1190471160414326785">are hard to relate to</a>.
This is a problem from several respects.  Without compelling examples,
nobody will want to teach it.  Even if they do, unless the examples
are compelling, students will not pay attention to it. And if the
students don’t, they won’t recognize opportunities to use it later in
their careers.</p>

<p>This loses much more than a testing technique. We consider PBT a
gateway to <em>formal specification</em>. Like a formal spec, it’s an
abstract statement about behaviors. Unlike a formal spec, it doesn’t
require learning a new language or mathematical formalism, it’s
executable, and it produces concrete counter-examples. We therefore
use it, in Brown’s Logic for Systems course, as the starting point to
more formal specifications. (If they learn nothing about formal
specification but simply become better testers, we’d still consider
that a win.)</p>

<p>Therefore, for the past 10 years, and with growing emphasis, we’ve
been teaching PBT: starting in our accelerated introductory course, then
in Logic for Systems, and gradually in other courses as well. But how
do we motivate the concept?</p>



<p>We motivate PBT through what we call <em>relational</em> problems. What are
those?</p>

<p>Think about your typical unit test. You write an input-output
pair: <code>f(x) is y</code>. Let’s say it fails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Usually, the function <code>f</code> is wrong. Congrats, you’ve just caught a bug!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, the test is wrong: <code>f(x)</code> is not, in fact, <code>y</code>. This can
take some reflection, and possibly reveals a misunderstanding of the
problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s usually where the unit-testing story ends. However, there is
one more possibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neither is “wrong”. <code>f(x)</code> has multiple legal results, <code>w</code>, <code>y</code>, and
<code>z</code>; your test chose <code>y</code>, but this particular implementation
happened to return <code>z</code> or <code>w</code> instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>We call these “relational” because <code>f</code> is clearly more a relation than
a function.</p>



<p>So far, so abstract. But many problems in computing actually have a
relational flavor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Consider computing shortest paths in a graph or network; there can
be <em>many</em> shortest paths, not just one. If we write a test to check
for one particular path, we could easily run into the problem
above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other graph algorithms are also relational. There are many
legal answers, and the implementation happens to pick just one of
them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-deterministic data structures inspire relational
behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various kinds of matching problems—e.g., the stable-marriage
problem—are relational.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are relational.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even sorting, when done over non-atomic data, is relational.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, computing is full of relational problems. While they are not
at all the only context in which PBT makes sense, they certainly
provide a rich collection of problems <em>that students already study</em>
that can be used to expose this idea in a non-trivial setting.</p>



<p>Okay, so we’ve been having students write PBT for several years
now. But how well do they do? How do we go about measuring such a
question? (Course grades are far too coarse, and even assignment
grades may include various criteria—like code style—that are not
strictly germane to this question.) Naturally, their core product is
a binary classifier—it labels a purported implementation as valid
or invalid—so we could compute precision and recall. However, these
measures still fail to offer any <em>semantic</em> insight
into how students did and what they missed.</p>

<p>We therefore created a new framework for assessing this. To wit, we
took each problem’s abstract property statement (viewed as a formal
specification), and sub-divided it into a <em>set of sub-properties whose
conjunction is the original property</em>. Each sub-property was then
turned into a test suite, which accepted those validators that
enforced the property and rejected those that did not. This let us get
a more fine-grained understanding of how students did, and what kinds
of mistakes they made.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Happy 2021! One of my (many) strange hobbies is to keep a list of ideas I would like to explore one day. Each year this list gets larger and my availablity gets smaller. This is why I want to share these ideas with you, hoping someone will find this inspiring and decide to create a company around it this year.</p>

<h2 id="netflix-for-podcasts">Netflix for Podcasts</h2>

<p>I’m a huge fan of podcasts. I’m currently spending an average of ~1.5 hours a day listening to podcasts. While there are lots of podcast apps, there is no one good source to recommend podcasts to listen to. Unlike movies or music, podcast episodes are not always sequential. For example, Joe Rogan may interview someone about bitcoin and in the next episode someone else about UFC. Following a person/podcast does not always make sense and sometimes you just want to follow a topic. Like some bands with only one good song, a podcast can have only one specific episode that is relevant to you. I wish I could find a place that recommends <strong>episodes</strong> not just <strong>podcasts</strong> that are relevant to my specific taste.
How? ML can be a good option. I will index all the podcasts out there (transcribe and vectorize the text) and from there try to group them based on similar interest. Also, looking at how people rate podcasts can help with this (people who loved X usually loved Y). It can be a massive capital investment upfront to transcribe all (or the most popular) podcasts, but once you have this in a text format you can monetize it later in different ways.</p>

<h2 id="stripe-for-nfc">Stripe for NFC</h2>

<p>NFC has entered our life more than ever after COVID-19. Touch-less payments are becoming the norm. Apple and Google pay work using NFC technology that allows your phone to communicate with the payment terminal. This is only one use-case of NFC. There is also a new proposal to get the NFC standard in browser as well. There can be so many more use cases: locking doors, activating devices, controlling passwords, unlocking cars, and much more. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the hardware and software sides. And in order for NFC product to work well, developers need to have both. It’s hard to develop an NFC product end-to-end: you need to manufacture your hardware, write custom software to integrate with the NFC protocol, and then implement it on IOS, Android, and soon browsers. There is a room for NFC-as-a-service where you define your API and get a ready to install chip to start building your product.</p>

<h2 id="secret-for-voice">Secret for voice</h2>

<p>I worked at Facebook and I know the power of communities. I also understand the need for anonymity. Nowadays where everyone focuses on visual aspects (TickTock, Instagram, etc..) there is a place for bringing back voice chats for deep, meaningful conversations. When COVID-19 forces people to shelter in place, there arises a need to talk to someone about anything you’re passionate about. These conversations can be anything from politics to personal stress and relationships. Having an anonymous platform to meet and talk with people about a specific topic can be an interchange between Reddit and Podcasts. The anonymity will allow people to open up to meaningful conversations and the voice-only will prevent bad actors from exposing you stuff you don’t want to see (chat-roulette?). You don’t need to look good to talk with someone, all you need to care about is the content of your conversation. You can add a rating system to bubble up the best people so it will create an incentive for meaningful conversations and will bad the bad actors. You can also choose if you want to save this person as anonymous contact in order to chat more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="remote-first-crm">Remote-first CRM</h2>

<p>Remote is becoming the new norm. The tools for remote are anything from communication (Slack, Zoom..), to project tracking to file sharing and documentations. There is a need for an opinionated remote-first tool that aggregates everything in one place. Instead of subscribing and paying to many SaaS services, I would love to have one place that has all the needed aspects for managing a remote company. Anything from tracking projects, to chatting and calling co-workers to all-hands and happy hours. I love Ruby on Rails because it is so opinionated and I believe there is a place for an opinionated way to run a remote-first business. It will not work for everyone, but for the companies who choose to adopt this methodology, the tools will be perfectly integrated with the day-to-day execution.</p>

<h2 id="better-goodreads">Better GoodReads</h2>

<p>As someone who likes to read a lot of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90647916-sagiv-ofek">books</a>, I am in dire need of a better GoodReads. Similar to Netflix for Podcasts, I would love to have Netflix for books with a social element to it.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-service-for-craigslist">Delivery service for Craigslist</h2>

<p>You want to buy a sofa on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace? Now you need to find how to deliver it. I wish there will be a built-in service that takes care of shipping the item. For smaller packages, you can simply use UPS/FedEx but there is a pain for larger items. This service can piggyback on the marketplace as PayPal did to eBay.</p>

<h2 id="ai-for-traffic-lights">AI for traffic lights</h2>

<p>How many times have you stopped at a red-light and the road was empty? Come on, just install a smart camera that analyzes the cars around it and control the traffic better. It can be as part of a bigger “smart city” initiative but that’s a good start.</p>

<h2 id="headspace-for-work">Headspace for work</h2>

<p>I want an app on my laptop that reminds me to take a break. I want it to connect to my busy calendar and suggest times for meditation, maybe a motivational speech before a meeting, etc. I have some on my phone but I want it to be active as part of my working day and not only when I wake up or before I go to sleep. It can have an enterprise play, where companies purchase a subscription for their employees as part of a wellbeing investment.</p>

<h2 id="guided-city-bus-tours">Guided city bus tours</h2>

<p>I live in NYC where you can find those big tourist buses that drive people around and tell them about the city. This usually costs $50. I will pay $5 for an app that I can download and tells me about the city while I take a $2.75 public bus. The routes are usually the same and I would rather like to have the recording in my headphones vs the crappy megaphone. The app will record your GPS location and will tell you about where you are based on your location. Can be for walking as well as for driving.</p>

<h2 id="better-mint">Better Mint</h2>

<p>I love tracking my finances. I mostly use Mint for it. If you ever used mint.com you probably know why there is a need for something better. The UI is from the 90s, they always try to upsell you credit cards and there are not insightful suggestions. There are many new apps that try to do it today but it’s usually part of a new bank/card initiative. There is an opportunity for better tracking and analyzing tool who can give you insights on your budget and how to be more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="mortgage-over-blockchain">Mortgage over blockchain</h2>

<p>Ever tried to get a mortgage? The process is painful. First, you need to disclose your privacy and credit score, fill out tons of paperwork, and pay crazy initiation fees. Smart contracts can do it with one click. Since blockchain records your previous transactions, your credit is determined based on your loan history and not other mambo-jumbo factors. Also, your credit is anonymous so people can loan money to you based on your credit alone. There is no need for lengthy documentation as all the logic will be part of the smart-contract code. Anything from transferring money to recording payments can be done in one place (making bankers, lawyers and their fees unnecessary). There is an opportunity to set up a company that takes care of the legality aspects. Combine that with a marketplace where people can lend to others (LendingClub style) simply based on their past blockchain credit.</p>

<h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it</h2>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>React Hooks are awesome, but they are not easy to use every day.</strong></p>
<p>A guide in 11 lessons to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how hooks work</li>
<li>Master common patterns</li>
<li>Solve recurring problems</li>
<li>Use hooks at their full potential</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why this book?</h2>
<p>In my experience with React and hooks, I have faced a lot of issues, spent some time debugging to understand where these issues came from, and seen other developers make the same mistakes again and again.</p>
<p>I have also seen several developers during technical tests in job interviews getting lost when using hooks because they needed to go past the basic use of <em>useState</em> and <em>useEffect</em>.</p>
<p>This is why I wrote this guide for developers who already know and use React, maybe even hooks, but would like to use them at their full potential.</p>
<h2>100% React</h2>
<p>The idea is not to present you dozens of awesome hooks: to begin you will only need two, <em>useState</em> and <em>useEffect</em>. First, we’ll deep dive into these two, then we’ll see some others to solve specific problems. Always by using only React, no third-party libraries.</p>
<p>By buying this guide, you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A condensed presentation of hooks and how they work,</li>
<li>Concrete common problems with several solutions to fix them,</li>
<li>Examples all along, because they are the best way to understand,</li>
<li>A list of useful online resources and third-party hooks to go deeper,</li>
<li>All in a beautifully presented document (for the PDF version).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Runnable examples</h2>
<p>The pack contains an archive will all the examples’ source code, plus the instructions to run them locally on your machine.</p>
<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>I’m Sebastien Castiel, a French developer expatriated in Montreal. I have used React for several years now, and hooks for the last two years, on several projects.</p>
<p>You can find my writings on my blog (<a href="https://scastiel.dev/">scastiel.dev</a>), or hear what I have to say on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/scastiel">@scastiel</a>). You can also say hi by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:sebastien@castiel.me">sebastien@castiel.me</a>.</p>
<h2>What if I don’t like what I bought?</h2>
<p>If you are not totally satisfied with the guide, I offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, no question asked. Just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sebastien@castiel.me">sebastien@castiel.me</a>.</p>
<h2>Table of contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Foreword</li>
<li>Lesson 1 - Store a local state with useState</li>
<li>Lesson 2 - Trigger side effects with useEffect</li>
<li>Lesson 3 - Custom hooks and classic async pattern</li>
<li>Lesson 4 - What are hooks anyway?</li>
<li>Lesson 5 - Debugging hooks</li>
<li>Lesson 6 - Get the current state when dealing with async code</li>

<p>Modern laptops are unusable. Spending more than a couple of hours on a laptop leads to neck or back pain. At first, it’s just uncomfortable, but then it becomes unbearable. The laptop forces you to hunch over it while you’re supposed to be sitting straight.</p>
<p>Your neck, wrists or back will eventually be hurt. For me, it was the neck. I just had to come up with something, or I couldn’t work. The display should be at eye level so my neck wouldn’t be under constant tension, which causes pain after a while.</p>
<p>There’s no such problem with desktop computers. There are monitors on a stand, and some people treat themselves with monitor arms. But I didn’t want to bind myself to just one workplace — that was the reason I bought a laptop in the first place.</p>
<p>I like working in coffee places sometimes. I wanted to stay mobile, and I wanted to work from the same computer at home and work.
And then I found the solution: a laptop stand. There are plenty of them. I started with a cardboard one.
</p><figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/on_a_stand.png" alt="Laptop on stand" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>It does the job and you can 
<a target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/2012/10/13/cardboard-laptop-stand-diy/">do it yourself</a><i></i> in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The more sophisticated one is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lPyB1D">Roost Stand</a><i></i>, from a former aerospace engineer. It can hold up to 20 kilograms, or 44 pounds. I upgraded to it after a while.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/roost.gif" alt="Roost Stand" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>This solution comes with a price: You can’t use the laptop’s keyboard and touchpad anymore. You have to buy an external keyboard and external mouse/trackpad.
In addition to the laptop and power brick, here is what you end up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>laptop stand.</li>
<li>Bluetooth mouse (can be less weird than mine).</li>
<li>Bluetooth keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/setup.jpg" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>You end up with 1 pound (or ~500 grams) more in your backpack. You have to carry two keyboards and two pointing devices if you want to be fully mobile. Soon I realized that I do not usually work at home, and left all but my laptop at the co-working place.</p>
<p>Laptop vendors do not seem to care or even notice this problem. But the problem exists.
I’ve been at the same coworking space for a while, and within three months three people asked me about the laptop stand and where to get it — and two of them eventually got it.</p>
<p>The laptop form factor is old. It’s the same screen plus keyboard booklet that it was 40 years ago. I think it’s time to come up with something new. The manufacturer that will invent a new design can be a true pioneer.</p>
<p>I will review more solutions and suggest my own in a separate post. Stay tuned!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Parkinson’s Law</a>, simply put, is that a task will grow to fill the amount of time that you give to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://antdke.co/parkinsons-law-graph.png" alt="" width="600"></p><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself 4 weeks to write an essay, it’ll likely take you most of, if not the whole, 4 weeks.</li>
<li>Give yourself 24 hours to write that same essay, it’ll take you less than, or the entire, 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-solution"><a href="#my-solution" aria-label="my solution permalink"></a>My Solution</h2>
<p>A solution I’ve found that works for beating this law is to <strong>set deadlines within the deadline time frame</strong>.</p>
<p>A generic example:</p>
<p>Let’s say it’s 1pm.</p>
<p>And you have until 5pm to get a task done.</p>
<p>It’s likely that your brain will make you procrastinate until you have an hour or two left.</p>
<p>What snaps you out of procrastination is the panic part of your brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much panic is bad -&gt; Anxiety</li>
<li>But a little panic is good -&gt; Alertness</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to kickstart the panic part of your brain earlier. <em>At will.</em></p>
<p>And you do that by setting a mini-deadline (let’s say 3pm) during the duration of the larger deadline (5pm).</p>
<p>And make it a real deadline. Write it down. Repeat it to yourself. Make it feel real. Replace the panic for 5pm with 3pm. Trust me, it works.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t really matter when you set your mini-deadlines or how many you set. <strong>The goal is to get you actively working earlier than the original, larger deadline.</strong> So set them how you see fit.</p>
<p>Now, by the time it’s 3pm, you’ll have gotten a huge chunk of your work done, if not half or all of it. Then, it’ll be a smoother ride to 5pm as you’ll have less work to rush through.</p>
<p>At that point, you can reset your panic to 5pm.</p>
<p>And <em>voila!</em> You’ve beaten Parkinson’s Law.</p>
<h2 id="its-scalable"><a href="#its-scalable" aria-label="its scalable permalink"></a>It’s Scalable</h2>
<p>The great thing is you can scale this solution up to work you have to do within a week’s deadline or 6 months deadline. Or even life goals with 2-10 year deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Just remember:</strong> Add solid deadlines within your deadline that will awaken the panic part of your brain early so you can get stuff done.</p>

<p>tl;dr: My ISP’s CGNAT session timeout is too short, meaning TCP keepalives gets dropped. Test if your own NAT, or your ISP’s CGN, violates <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382">RFC5382</a>‘s REQ-5 using this tool: <a href="https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test">https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test</a>.</p>



<p>I have been working from home more lately, where I have SSH sessions open to the servers that I’m working on. Often when I return to my computer, or switch to a SSH session that has been sitting idle for a while, the SSH connection is either dead or frozen. If the session is not already dead, the only way to gain control over my terminal again, is to send the ‘terminate connection’ <a href="https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/11/08/ssh-escape-sequences-aka-kill-dead-ssh-sessions/">ssh escape sequence</a> <strong>&lt;enter&gt;~.</strong> after which SSH errors like this:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2e4f5a416e43475c5c415c5d004a415a5d5c4d00415c49">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ 
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe</pre>



<p>This happened one day while I was transferring a VM image in the hundreds of gigabytes from one server to another using netcat like so:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b9d8cdd6f9d1d6cacd8b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -l 1337 &gt; hugefile 
<a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fa9b8e95ba9295898ecb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -q 1 host2 1337 &lt; hugefile</pre>



<p>This transfer would take multiple hours, and when I checked in after it should have finished, my SSH connections had died yet again. And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.</p>



<p>That’s when I decided to investigate this problem.</p>



<p>The OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers are known for their extreme focus on code quality. The chances that this problem is caused by a bug in OpenSSH are very slim. (In the same line as “It is (almost) never a compiler error.”)</p>



<p>This is probably a network problem.</p>



<p>I connected my laptop directly to my ISP’s “customer-provided equipment”: a coax modem in bridge mode. Then I ran tcpdump both on my laptop and on the server, and opened a SSH connection. After leaving it idle for about 2 1/2 hours, this is the result:</p>



<p>Client: 100.68.156.34 / 203.0.113.1, server: 130.225.254.99.</p>

<p>A SSH session does not generate any traffic, unless there’s new output or input. The same is true for TCP. That is why, after the TCP and SSH sessions have been established, no more packages are sent for a long time.</p>



<p>First thing to note, is that my laptop gets an IP in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598">Carrier-grade NAT address space 100.64.0.0/10</a>, which my ISP then translates to a public internet routable IP. (Because I don’t want to leak my public IP, I used the <a href="https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcprewrite">tcprewrite</a> tool to substitute that IP with one in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737">TEST-NET-3</a>).</p>



<p>Next thing to note, is that after about 2 hours, both the client and the server starts to send TCP-keepalive packages, but none of them come through to the other side.</p>



<p>Finally the client gives up on the TCP session, and sends a TCP reset package, which surprisingly goes through.</p>



<p>Lets see what we can find in the OpenSSH man pages about timeouts and keepalives (ssh_config(5)):</p>



<pre><strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong>
    Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.&nbsp; If they are sent, death of the
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.&nbsp; This option only uses TCP keepalives (as op‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.&nbsp; As such, you proba‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bly want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.&nbsp; However, this means that connections will die if the route is down
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The default is yes</strong> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the re‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mote host dies.&nbsp; This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no.&nbsp; See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepalives.
<strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong>
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a mes‐
    sage through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.&nbsp; <strong>The default is 0, indicating that these</strong>
    <strong>messages will not be sent to the server</strong>, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific). </pre>



<p>So <strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong> enables keepalives handled by the TCP stack implementation (Linux in my case), whereas <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> enables protocol level keep-alives (handled by OpenSSH).</p>



<p>This explains the behavior we’re observing, but also raises new questions:</p>



<ol><li>Can I fix my problem by enabling the ssh protocol-level-keepalives? (ServerAliveInterval)</li><li>Why are the TCP keepalives only sent after 2 hours?</li><li>Why is my ISP dropping my TCP keepalive packages?</li></ol>



<p>I verified that by setting <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> to 300 (5 min), my problems disappeared. We could stop now that I found a workaround, but let’s keep digging.</p>



<p>The TCP keepalive interval on Linux is configured by <strong>net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time</strong>, which by default is set to 2 hours (7200).</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="63020d07061110231601160d17164e07061008170c13">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 7200</pre>



<p>Why is it set to two hours? We find our answer in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC1122</a>:</p>



<pre>Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
acknowledgement packets have been received for the
connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
configurable and <strong>MUST default to no less than two hours</strong>.</pre>



<p>In the following DISCUSSION section, the RFC writers elaborate on why they (in 1989) think TCP keep-alives only should be sent infrequently:</p>



<pre>The TCP specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism because it could:
(1) cause perfectly good connections to break during transient Internet failures;
(2) consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and
(3) cost money for an Internet path that charges for packets.</pre>



<p>Today the Internet is different from what it was in 1989 when they published that RFC. Now we have NAT everywhere, which is a hack that was accepted on IPv4 because the IPv4 address space is too small. The real solution is IPv6 which has a much bigger address space (2^32 vs 2^128).</p>



<p>NAT (Network Address Translation) allows many computers on a network to share the same IP. This typically works by routing your packet to a device which translates/substitutes your private <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> IP (e.g 192.168.0.0/16) for a public one, and passes on the packet.</p>



<p>CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) is NAT run by an ISP. This allows for many customers to share a single public IP (because even with every household being assigned a single IPv4, we’re still running out). To avoid collisions with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> ranges, ISPs are told to use the 100.64.0.0/10 range. With this setup it is not uncommon to have 3 levels of NAT. Ex, CGN, CPE that also does NAT, and the customers own router.</p>



<p>A NAT device must keep track of which connections are made by the clients. This information is stored in the NAT table. Whenever a packet arrives from the Internet, it checks if the packet belongs to any connections in its NAT table, to figure determine which client to send the package to. If it doesn’t belong to any connections, it drops the packet.</p>



<p>This wouldn’t work if the NAT table only stored IP addresses – which client should the NAT device send the packet to if receiving a packet from a server two of its clients are connected to? That is why – unlike routers – NAT devices have to cross protocol boundaries, and look deeper inside the packet and find a “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3022">transport identifier</a>“. For TCP and UDP the identifiers used are the source and destination port numbers, and for ICMP the Query <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">Identifier</a> is usually used.</p>



<p>A NAT table looks something like this (we’ll ignore ICMP for now):</p>



<pre>PROTOCOL SRCIP       SRCPORT DSTIP          DSTPORT NEWSRCPORT IDLETIME
TCP      192.168.1.1 52264   130.225.254.99 22      52264      983
UDP      192.168.1.2 39252   8.8.8.8        53      39252      0</pre>



<p>This NAT hack unfortunately opened up Pandora’s box of problems that we are still dealing with today. For example, you can no longer initiate a connection to a computer behind NAT. The NAT device does not know which host to send the packet to. This is why NAT’ing is often equated with firewalling. It is not a feature as such. It is a side effect of the NAT hack.</p>



<p>Back when NAT was introduced, it was not uncommon for protocols to rely on the server establishing a second connection back to the client. In “Active FTP” for example, the server will initiate a new connection back to the client (the data channel) after the client has connected. For this to work the NAT must be even more protocol aware, and preemptively create a mapping for the requested port. The same is true for SIP (used for VoIP) and a few other protocols. This is why most NAT devices can be configured to be FTP and SIP aware. Exactly this feature was recently shown to be a huge security problem – you can trigger this functionality to create a mapping of your choosing from a visitors browser, and connect to any device behind the visitors NAT. Read more about the <a href="https://github.com/samyk/slipstream">NAT Slipstreaming attack here</a>.</p>



<p>For big data transfers, or latency sensitive connections (file sharing, VoIP, gaming etc) it is very much preferable to have a direct connection between hosts. But if both hosts are behind a NAT, this is not immediately possible. To solve this problem, a new hack was introduced: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389">NAT hole punching</a>, where you – by using a third-party – can trick your NAT devices to allow traffic directly between the hosts by creating a NAT table entry (“punching” a hole) in both NATs simultaneously. It is only somewhat reliable, and works best with UDP in my experience.</p>



<p>NAT is also one of the reasons the new <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/?include_text=1">QUIC</a> protocol uses UDP packages instead of its own protocol. Too many devices will fail to handle the packet correctly if they introduced a new <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml">protocol number</a> to use in the IP header. Where should the NAT device look for a transport identifier in an unknown protocol header?</p>



<p>Another problem that arises because of NAT is: when is it safe to remove an entry from the NAT table? Sometimes the answer is simple: when you see that the connection has been closed (e.g the TCP Normal Close Sequence). But when is it safe to remove an established …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>For many Americans, the events of the past week have left emotions raw, tempers hot, and for some, social media accounts deactivated. </p><p>It’s a reasonable response by those who believe various social networks allowed disinformation to flourish, or worse: allowed seditious plots to metastasize on their platforms, which led to a mob storming the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The very social platforms that are being (rightly) targeted for their role in fanning the flames of an insurrection are the same ones that drive traffic to news sites. To exist today, newsrooms have little to no choice: social platforms are a necessary evil.</p><p>The irony is astounding: a boycott protesting the spread of disinformation could be so harmful to the viability of journalism. This is why we need so desperately to detangle the fates of newsrooms from that of social platforms. </p><p>Reliable, factual updates are a requirement for an informed citizenry, and Democracy cannot function without one. &nbsp;And for an industry operating on ever decreasing margins, the page views that come from these platforms &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nillium.com/news-was-never-meant-for-social-platforms/">are keeping them alive</a>, even as the business models associated with this set up slowly kill them. &nbsp;</p><p>News is expensive. &nbsp;Long before any article is written, before any video is shot, reporters spend time on the phone, traveling to meet with sources, often to only find that there is no story there. &nbsp;They do it usually because of a passion for keeping their fellow citizens informed, for striving to uncover the truth. &nbsp;But they also have expenses, and need to be paid.</p><p>As ad dollars and traffic coalesce around a few major players online, news websites had to adapt. &nbsp;They have written ever-more catchy headlines to grab attention. The story selection has become driven by trending topics in an effort to appear at the top of newsfeeds. &nbsp;The algorithms behind such feeds make local news even harder to find because, by definition, it doesn’t appeal to the widest audience possible. &nbsp;The sites, in turn, had to make the most of what traffic they could get; covering pages in ads and trackers. &nbsp;It’s a spiral to the bottom.</p><p>But, it’s not too late to turn things around.</p><p>For those that want to make an impact, please support journalism. Subscribe to your local newspaper.</p><p>We need to think about weaning news from platforms that have such a parasitic impact. &nbsp;If we cannot find a viable model for trustworthy news online, we will be left with the only information sources that seem to be thriving now; the least credible of them all. &nbsp;</p><p>Our solution is relatively simple. &nbsp;We’re building a platform that takes the best from social media -- the concise updates, the real time streams, and the direct line of communication from reporters, but in a news-friendly way. &nbsp;Our ads appear in between updates, not tying their value to any individual click through, and revenue is shared according to the contributions to the platform, not views. &nbsp;We’re only allowing trusted journalists to post, blocking disinformation before it has a chance to root itself in our systems.</p><p>We invite you to join us, and welcome any suggestions or improvements.</p><p><em>Nillium is building Forth, a new news platform based on concise updates from trusted journalists, sharing advertising revenue with the reporters and their newsrooms. &nbsp;To sign up for our waiting list, <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">click here</a>. &nbsp; Newsrooms and independent reporters can express their interest in joining the platform <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpLKCBdKrkOqCiaHheoOQBCvqbR3ydaCW1N1sy69RNLJGwQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.478247111=blog.nillium.com">here</a>.</em></p>

from <a href="https://twitter.com/notjessewalker">Jesse Walker</a>’s<em>&nbsp;United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory</em></p>
<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> laid out the basic instructions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck">Operation Mindfuck</a> in a memo sent to several friends (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krassner">Paul Krassner</a>). Participants were “to circulate all rumors contributed by other members,” and they were “to attribute all national calamities, assassinations or conspiracies to the other member-groups.”</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQ93LLRnLYA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>The one great risk, he cautioned, was that “the Establishment might be paranoid enough to believe some wild legend started by one of us and thereupon round up all of us for killing Abraham Lincoln.” So they sent a letter on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Bavarian Illuminati</a> stationery to the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade, just to confirm that “we’ve taken over the Rock Music business. But you’re still so naïve. We took over the business in the 1800s. Beethoven was our first convert.”</p>

<p>Robert Welch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society#History">John Birch Society</a> got a letter informing him that Gary Allen was an Illuminati agent. When a New Orleans jury refused to convict one of the men Jim Garrison blamed for the JFK killing, Garrison’s booster Art Kunkin of the leftist <em>Los Angeles Free Press</em> received a missive from the “Order of the Phoenix Angel” revealing that the jurors were all members of the Illuminati.</p>

<p>The telltale sign, the letter explained, was that none of them had a left nipple. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discordians</a> planted stories about the secret society in various leftist, libertarian, and hippie publications, introducing the Illuminati to the counterculture. “We accused everybody of being in the Illuminati,” Wilson recalled. “Nixon, Johnson, William Buckley, Jr., ourselves, Martian invaders, all the conspiracy buffs,&nbsp;<em>everybody</em>.” But they did not regard this as a hoax or prank in the ordinary sense. We still considered it guerrilla ontology.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHtN2Ajt9Ao?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>My personal attitude was that if the New Left wanted to live in the particular tunnel-reality of the hard-core paranoid, they had an absolute right to that neurological choice. I saw Discordianism as the Cosmic Giggle Factor, introducing so many alternative paranoias that everybody could pick a favorite, if they were inclined that way. I also hoped that some less gullible souls, overwhelmed by this embarrassment of riches, might see through the whole paranoia game and decide to mutate to a wider, funnier, more hopeful reality-map.</p>

<p>They inserted that chart into&nbsp;<em>The East Village Other</em>. They placed odd ads in&nbsp;<em>Innovator</em>. They practically took over the Chicago paper&nbsp;<em>roger SPARK</em>, which once had been a fairly staid New Left outlet affiliated with the 49th Ward Citizens for Independent Political Action. The Discordians filled it with anarchist politics and surrealist satire.</p>

<p>Someone scanning the classifieds might see an ad declaring, “paranoids unite; you have nothing to fear but each other! Send for the informative booklet ‘How to Start Your Own Conspiracy’. Free from the Office of the District Attorney, New Orleans.” In the summer of 1969, the paper accused Chicago’s mayor of being an arm of the octopus, running the front-page headline Daley Linked with Illuminati.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujz0JQeEa-M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>In the April 1969 edition of the Playboy Advisor column, right after an inquiry about blue balls, this missive appeared: “I recently heard an old man of right-wing views—a friend of my grandparents’—assert that the current wave of assassinations in America is the work of a secret society called the Illuminati. He said that the Illuminati have existed throughout history, own the international banking cartels, have all been 32nd-degree Masons and were known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>, who portrayed them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> in his James Bond books—for which the Illuminati did away with Mr. Fleming. At first, this all seemed like a paranoid delusion to me.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFJ9u5t1riE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Then I read in <em>The New Yorker</em>&nbsp;that Allan Chapman, one of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison">Jim Garrison</a>’s investigators in the New Orleans probe of the John Kennedy assassination, believes that the Illuminati really exist. The next step in my galloping descent into credulity occurred when I mentioned this subject to a friend who is majoring in Middle Eastern affairs. He told me the Illuminati were actually of Arabic origin and that their founder was the legendary “old man of the mountains,” who used marijuana to work up a murderous frenzy and who fought against both the Crusaders and the orthodox Moslems, adding that their present ruler is the Aga Khan; but, he said, it is now merely a harmless religious order known as Ismailianism.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpatFZ0R1mU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>I then began to wonder seriously about all this. I mentioned it to a friend from Berkeley. He immediately told me that there is a group on campus that calls itself the Illuminati and boasts that it secretly controls international finance and the mass media. Now (if&nbsp;<em>Playboy</em> isn’t part of the Illuminati conspiracy), can you tell me: Are the Illuminati part of the Masons? Is Aga Khan their leader? Do they really own all the banks and TV stations? And who have they killed lately?” The letter was signed “R.S., Kansas City, Missouri,” but it had actually been cooked up by Wilson and Thornley. Wilson’s reply, written in the light and neutral tone expected of the Playboy Advisor, cleared up most of the historical confusions contained in the letter (though it added the unsupported claim that Weishaupt’s Illuminati were “based loosely” on the Old Man of the Mountain’s order). The Berkeley Illuminati, Wilson added, were “a put-on by local anarchists.”</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zg8zoFZiHCs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>It wasn’t always easy to tell where Operation Mindfuck ended and sincere paranoia began. “The Discordian revelations seem to have pressed a magick button,” Wilson later wrote. “New exposés of the Illuminati began to appear everywhere, in journals ranging from the extreme Right to the ultra-Left. Some of this was definitely not coming from us Discordians.” Not that it was always clear who “us Discordians” were either. Though some of the Berkeley Illuminati were acquainted with Thornley, they had independently invented the joke of posing as an ancient conspiracy. At one point, Wilson recalled, the <em>Los Angeles Free Press</em> printed “a taped interview with a black phone-caller who claimed to represent the ‘Black Mass,’ an Afro-Discordian conspiracy we had never heard of. He took credit, on behalf of the Black Mass and the Discordians, for all the bombings elsewhere attributed to the Weather Underground.”</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XybPIUNiTpk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Wilson and Thornley met only once in that period, when Wilson spent the night at Thornley’s place in Tampa in 1968. They smoked some pot and started ruminating about their project. “What if there really is an Illuminati?” Wilson asked. “Maybe they’ll find out about us and be pissed.” Thornley replied, “I doubt if there is. And if there by some chance is, they would probably be very happy to have wildass fools like us covering up for them by spreading bizarre theories.” In 1969, Wilson and another&nbsp;<em>Playboy</em>&nbsp;editor, Robert Shea, began to work on what would become the most influential element of Operation Mindfuck.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXfbIrLV9W4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Inspired by the nutty letters the magazine often received, Shea and Wilson decided to write a novel “perched midway between satire and melodrama, and also delicately balancing between ‘proving’ the case for multiple conspiracies and undermining the ‘proof.’” The result was&nbsp;<em>Illuminatus!</em> It was basically finished in 1971 but it wouldn’t be published for another four years, with significant cuts and with the book sliced into three volumes.70 A one-volume edition finally appeared in 1984…”</p>

OM 2.0: Hippie effort to destabilize the American dream may have worked too well<br>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/rushkoff">Douglas Rushkoff&nbsp;</a> /&nbsp; Apr 24, 2019</p>
<p>“Propaganda used to mean getting people to believe stuff. Now it means getting them to question what they believe or whether there’s any truth at all. However disorienting this is, it may not be all bad.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/22d6tRXxVeg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>The term “propaganda” originally referred to a 17th-century committee of Roman Catholic cardinals that sought to propagate the religion through foreign missions — the marginally and only temporarily benevolent face of European colonialism. In modern times, public relations guru&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/bernprop.html">Ed Bernays</a> revived the term to describe the way Woodrow Wilson’s administration convinced Americans to support U.S. involvement in World War I. Propaganda was about telling the same story through so many media channels at once that there appeared to be only one story. Today, however, the primary goal of government propaganda is to undermine our faith in everything.</p>

    <h2 id="how-i-decided-to-write-a-spellchecker-and-almost-died-trying">How I decided to write a spellchecker and almost died trying</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had a fun idea for a “weekend project”: pure-Ruby spellchecker. Ruby is my language of choice, and no-dependencies spellchecker seemed a small useful tool for the CI environment: for example, to check comments/docs spelling without installing any third-party software. I actually <em>could’ve</em> pulled out the project in its limited scope (only English, only spot misspelled words without fixing, limited dictionary) with just a flat list of known words, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>Back then, I decided to make a moderately generic tool, at least able to work with multiple languages. Fortunately (or so I believed!), there were many already existing and freely available spellchecking dictionaries distributed as LibreOffice and Firefox extensions. All of those dictionaries are in the format defined by the <strong><a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">Hunspell</a></strong> tool/library—which is an open-source library that is used for spellchecking in Libre/OpenOffice, Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird), but also Google Chrome/Chromium, macOS, several Adobe products, and so on.</p>

<p>The dictionaries looked like easy to reuse text files with some (“insignificant” as it seemed) metadata, and the whole “use Hunspell dictionaries from pure Ruby spellchecker” project <em>still</em> felt like a “weekend-long” one, for the first few weekends. Only gradually the underwater complexity of the multilanguage word-by-word spellchecking uncovered. Eventually, I was distracted from the project and abandoned it, but I still had the fascination with the seemingly-simple, actually-mind-blowingly-complicated Hunspell, the software everybody used daily and hardly ever notice.</p>

<p>The idea to dig deeper into it, to <em>understand</em> it and <em>explain</em>, grew on me and bothered me for quite some time. And what is a better way to understand something, if not to retell it in your own words? After several lazy and not very far-progressed attempts to write something Hunspell-alike (twice in Ruby, once in Rust, once in Python), eventually, in February 2020, the task I settled down to solve is: “explanatory rewrite” of the Hunspell into high-level language with a lot of comments. I achieved this goal by December 2020, with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> project: <strong>the port of Hunspell’s core algorithms into modern, well-documented, well-structured Python</strong>.</p>

<p>And now I want to share some insights of what I uncovered on the road: about spellchecking in general and Hunspell in particular.</p>

<p>In the ongoing article series, I’ll cover these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Hunspell, why is it significant, and why try to “explain” it (current article)</li>
  <li>Base spellchecking concepts: lookup and suggest, as seen by Hunspell</li>
  <li>How lookup (checking if the word is correct) works, and why it could be much more complicated than “just look in the list of the known words”</li>
  <li>How suggest (proposed fix for the incorrect word) works, and how hard it is to estimate its quality</li>
  <li>A closer look into Hunspell’s dictionary format. It is the most widespread open dictionary format in the world, and we’ll see what linguistic and algorithmic information it <em>potentially</em> can carry, and what part of it is actually used in existing dictionaries</li>
  <li>Some details on Spylls implementation process and results</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts on the big picture of word-by-word spellchecker problem, and Hunspell’s approach to it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-hunspell">What is Hunspell?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The information on Hunspell’s origins and history is mostly my guesses, following partial and incomplete sources everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell (<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell">Wikpedia article</a></small>), initially <strong>Hun</strong>garian spellchecker, emerged as an alternative for previously existing aspell/ispell/myspell somewhere in 2002 (I guess?). It was created by László Németh, in a need of supporting languages with complicated suffixing/prefixing rules and word compounding (such as Hungarian). Hunspell’s design seemingly proved itself to be flexible enough to support most of the world’s languages, and in a few years, it became the most used spellchecker in the world. You have most probably used it even if you’ve never heard the name before today: Hunspell is the default spellchecking engine in Chrome and Firefox, Libre/OpenOffice, Adobe products, and macOS (not an exhaustive list). Dictionaries in Hunspell format exist for almost all actively used languages for which the concept of word-by-word spellchecking makes sense<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Currently, Hunspell is maintained <a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">on GitHub</a> (repo has only around 1k stars, will you believe it?). It seems that maintenance is not that easy if you’ll weight the number of open issues and PRs, and the latest commits timeline: at the time of writing it (Jan 2021), the last commit to master was of May 2020, and the last release was 1.7 on Dec 2018. Hunspell’s codebase is mostly “old-school” C++. It is being slowly modernized and it has very few comments; there are thousands of two-branch <code>if</code>s to handle non-Unicode and Unicode text separately. There is also an attempt to rewrite Hunspell from scratch in a modern C++, which at some point was developed under the <code>hunspell</code> GitHub organization. Now it is independent and called <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> (and, while not yet supporting all of the Hunspell features, already “achieved” version 4.2.0).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are open-source spellcheckers other than Hunspell. GNU aspell (that at one point was superseded by Hunspell, but still holds its ground in English suggestion quality), to name one of the older ones; but also there are novel approaches, like <a href="https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell">SymSpell</a>, claiming to be “1 million times faster” or ML-based <a href="https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell">JamSpell</a>, claiming to be much more accurate.</p>

<p>And yet, what makes Hunspell stand out is its coverage of the world’s languages. It is not ideal, but the amount of dictionaries ready to use immediately, and amount of <em>experience</em> of dealing with typical problems and corner cases, coded into the codebase, is hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="why-rewrite-it">Why rewrite it?</h3>

<p>As I’ve already stated above, the goal of the Spylls project was to create an <em>explanatory</em> rewrite: E.g., the “retelling” of how Hunspell works in a way that is easy to follow and to play with.</p>

<p>The necessity of this approach came to me from three facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hunspell is used almost everywhere and is taken for granted;</li>
  <li>It is much more complicated than one might naively expect;</li>
  <li>This complexity—and years of human work that was spent growing the project—is notoriously hard to follow through the Hunspell’s codebase and grasp in full.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, I wanted to <strong>make the knowledge behind Hunspell more open</strong>.</p>

<p>The way I have chosen was not, of course, the only one possible. I could’ve just read through the original code and write a series of articles (or, rather, a book?) on how it works. I could’ve thoroughly commented and republished the original source code. But I felt that <em>reimplementing</em> is the only way of understanding what’s and why’s of the algorithms (at least for somebody not being a Hunspell’s core developer); and that implementation in a high-level language will allow focusing on words and language-related algorithms, not memory management or fighting with Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are also a few “pragmatic” ports of Hunspell into other languages (in order to use it in environments where C++ dependency is undesireable), namely <a href="https://github.com/aarondandy/WeCantSpell.Hunspell">WeCantSpell.Hunspell</a> in C# and <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/nspell">nspell</a> in JS (very incomplete); and aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> can also be considered a “port” (from legacy C++ to a modern one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>

<p>My language of choice is Ruby. It was also the first language that I’ve tried to port Hunspell into. I’d be happy to proceed with Ruby if my goal has been just a “pragmatic” library. And yet, when I decided that my goal is to make the knowledge of Hunspell’s algorithms accessible to a wide audience, I understood that Ruby is not the best choice: language reputation (slightly esoteric and mostly-for-web) would make my project lest noticeable; and my preferred coding style (mix of OO and functional, with lots of small immutable domain objects and fluent chains of iterators), while allowing me to be very effective, would make the code less accessible to other languages users.</p>

<p>What I needed was a high-level language, with as low boilerplate as possible; as mainstream as possible; as easy to experiment with and prototype as possible. Without diving into too much argument here, Python and modern JavaScript seemed to be the most suitable options, and, to be honest, Python was just closer to my soul. So, here we are!</p>

<p>The code style is mostly imperative (as it corresponds to how Hunspell is structured), with large-ish, but clearly structured methods, and a small number of classes/objects (mostly they are either “whole algorithm as a class” or almost-passive “structs” – or, in Python, dataclasses). I tried to limit myself in the usage of complex Python-specific features (like functools or itertools), but have a decent use of “list comprehensions” (as they are quite readable and Pythonic) and generators (lazy lists). Overall, I wanted the code to be good Python, but not too smart. Whether I succeeded, is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> has <strong>≈1.5k lines of library code</strong> in 14 files. It conforms (with <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#completeness">some reservations</a>) to all Hunspell’s integrational tests. Those tests look like a set of files each, consisting of “test dictionary + what words should be considered good, what words should be considered bad, what should be suggested instead of the bad words”, and there are <strong>127 of such sets to pass</strong>. There are <strong>2 thousand comment lines</strong> in the code, explaining thoroughly every detail of the algorithm and rendered at the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell.html">Spylls documentation site</a>; note that besides docstrings at the beginning of each class and method, there are also inline comments in code—that’s why the documentation site uses custom theme with inline “Show code” feature.</p>

<p>With this being said, I am wrapping up the introductory post.</p>

<p><strong>In the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">next series</a>: An introduction to Hunspell’s “lookup” and “suggest” concepts; and deeper dive into the lookup.</strong></p>

OK, this isn't very innovative, but it's still a fun weekend project. The setup starts with a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Transfer-Pipettes-Graduated-Pack/dp/B005CD2I50/">transfer pipette</a>,
with a tiny hole made on top so that any water inside will slowly drip:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/rig_dropper.jpg">


This is followed by a jury-rigged optointerrupter: a 
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kingbright/W53F3C/?qs=vOfupq2Pai1/e8qOzlr1Dg==">fairly standard IR diode</a>, a 
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Everlight/EL-PT204-6B/?qs=vs%252bWWTB4QKYbxvxFCv90EQ==">matched phototransistor</a>,
two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00137S8ZI/ref=biss_dp_t_asn">5 mm nylon spacers</a>, 
top half of a <a href="http://www.tedpella.com/beakers_html/beakers.htm#anchor284242">polypropylene beaker</a>,
and copious amounts of hot-melt glue. The diode is connected to +5V through a 220 Ω resistor; the phototransistor
uses a 10 kΩ one, in the <a href="http://learn.parallax.com/sites/default/files/content/shield/robo_ch6/series_sch.jpg">usual
topology</a>. That's good enough to detect the light that gets refracted by a passing drop of water:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/rig_photodetector.jpg">


Next up is a clear plastic box (recycled packaging from an electronic gadget of some sort) and 
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/images/doc8025.pdf">ATmega48P</a> running at 20 MHz
with an eight-line program that monitors the phototransistor, waits 80 milliseconds (chosen very empirically),
and then turns another pin on for approximately 50 microseconds (ditto):


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/rig_circuit.jpg">


The MCU is hooked up in a textbook fashion, the only external components being a 20 MHz crystal and a low-ESR capacitor.
The program is just this:

<xmp>
  while (1) {

    while (!(PINC & 1));
    _delay_ms(80);

    PORTB = 1;
    _delay_us(50);
    PORTB = 0;

    _delay_ms(100);

  }
</xmp>

A camera is placed on a tripod in front of the whole contraption. The exposure is manually set to several seconds,
with all lights turned off. When an event is registered by the phototransistor, a
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/ON-Semiconductor/NTD4858N-35G/?qs=t2BMfLoP1KToQIN0Enz8Jw==">power MOSFET</a>
connected to the output pin of the microcontroller will eventually light up a bank of  
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Cree-Inc/MX6AWT-A1-0000-000CE5/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMu4Prknbu83yw4IfwWVf55KzA7tVSYrb8Q%3d">100
lumen LEDs</a> operated at roughly five times their rated current (this doesn't kill the LED in low-duty, short-pulse applications).
The LEDs momentarily illuminate the scene for 1/20,000th of a second, and the camera captures an image:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/rig_light.jpg">


One of the nice things about LEDs is that they have rise and fall times of under a microsecond. That's considerably shorter than
traditional camera flash, which lights up for around 1-2 milliseconds at high power (and goes down to about 50-100 microseconds
only at lowest settings). In principle, LEDs could rival the motion-stopping powers of more exotic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-gap_flash">air-gap</a> flash units.



All right, so that's it, let's showcase some photos (with a macro tube attached to Canon 50/1.8). There's enough light to shoot
at f/11. Here's the moment of initial impact - I found this interesting because I don't think I have ever seen such a picture
before:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/splash3-1.jpg">


Here's are two of the more conventional takes, taken within the next 5 milliseconds or so:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/splash3-2.jpg">



<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/splash3-3.jpg">


And these are from earlier experiments with longer exposures (1/5,000) and fewer LEDs - still OK, but a bit
more blurry:


<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/splash3.jpg">



<img src="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/water/splash4.jpg">


After about 10 miliseconds, the pretty part is over, and all you can see is a series of waves spreading
away from the site of impact.

<p>
The recommendation is a mix of these poll results and <a href="https://simpletools.info/doku.php/about#our_criteria" title="about" data-wiki-id="about">our criteria</a>. Actually, we have two recommendations.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="for_beginners">For beginners</h3>
<div>

<p>
<strong>i3</strong> is not only the most popular tiling window manager in our poll, it is also the our recommendation for users who want to begin using a tiling wm. It's easy enough to start with and the configuration file is fairly understandable. In fact Fedora will release an official i3 Spin, beginning with version 34. At the same time i3 is still very lightweight.

The documentation and relatively huge community makes it also a good choice for non-expert people or other persons who don't want to spend too much time configuring.

<p>
<strong>bspwm</strong> is a extremely lightweight window manager. Once you get it running by installing the example configuration files, experienced users shouldn't have too much problems to adapt it according to their needs. The concept of nodes is a little strange to get used to, but the configuration file of sxhkd is easy enough to understand. bspwm has gained some popularity in the last time, so there is also a community which can help.

<p>
Don't like bspwm for some reasons, but still looking for a lightweight tiling wm for experienced users? Then you might want to have a look at <strong>herbstluftwm</strong>

            I've always enjoyed teaching and mentoring. A couple of years ago I had the great privilege to teach a class in web programming for the Computer Science department at the University of Arizona. So I thought I would dust off that course material, update it for 2020, and release it again as a podcast and video series. I hope you find it useful.

      <h2>Show Notes</h2>
      <p>Hi, and welcome to web 101</p>
<p>My name is Mark Fischer. I'm a web developer and programmer, and have been working with web technologies since 1994.</p>
<p>I've always enjoyed teaching and mentoring. A couple of years ago I had the great privilege to teach a class in web programming for the Computer Science department at the University of Arizona. I had a lot of fun teaching those classes, and in the intervening years have wished I could refer back to pieces of that material to show co-workers and clients. So I thought I would dust off that course material, update it for 2020, and release it again as a podcast and video series.</p>
<p>There are innumerable ways to learn about web technologies these days, but who knows. Maybe my way of explaining the web resonates with you more than one of those others. Either way, this is a thing I wish existed, so I'm going to make it.</p>
<p>I don't know what sort of schedule I'll be able to keep to, but I want to keep episodes relatively short and focused, no more than 30 minutes. I'm going to try for something every week.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to the podcast, and watch the videos at web101.org.</p>
<p>Take it easy, and we'll see you next time.</p>

<p>Recently Parler is getting lot of attention on online and mainstream media, and not for a good reason. This is because Parler is getting banned from almost every service they have been using, from Amazon’s AWS, to Twilio for SMS verification. They also got their app kicked off from both Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore.</p>
<p>All due to the involvement of the network with the Capitol Hill riots on January 6th.</p>
<p>However, what if Parler was a decentralised network? with multiple nodes, ranging from hundreds to thousands. Technically abled users serving their own nodes, and mirrors with different domain names?</p>
<p>A decentralised network like this would be hard to kill. Yes, Google will kick them off PlayStore, and so will Apple from their AppStore. But no one will be able to purge the service off the internet.</p>
<p>The downside is that Parler won’t be able to make any money, because their code has to be open sourced, and their data won’t be centralised, and monetisation will be difficult. </p>
<p>Parler might not make a comeback. However the networks of the future, especially networks of the extremists will be decentralised, funded by the followers, developed and maintained by extremists and loyalists, ultimately making it difficult or even impossible to completely remove from the internet.</p>
<p>One can argue that Parler, Trump and his followers all failed or lost their contact because they replied on several centralised services, which nor Trump or his followers had any control. (YouTube, Twitter, AWS etc)</p>
<p>And just imagine someone like Donal Trump, charging his followers on a decentralised network instead on Twitter? That is a scary thought to think about, but a thought that might become a reality in future.</p>

<p>Although not as popular as imperative programming languages, functional programming has taught developers to write semantic code for decades. When working with imperative and object-oriented languages, developers are often obliged to think of language abstractions such as abstract classes and loops. In contrast, programmers feel empowered to think of the problem at hand when using functional languages, and there are many reasons for that.</p>



<p>Functional languages are much closer to mathematics, and there aren’t as many design patterns as you find in traditional programming paradigms. This absence of design patterns doesn’t mean that they are worse than popular dialects; the reason for that is there are no needs for complicating language semantics and structure.</p>



<p>I will criticize Kotlin here, but if you take a closer look at Kotlin complicated semantics compared with Clojure or Haskell, you’ll find that for extending imperative languages’ usefulness, language designers need to complicate the life of developers. The cool parts of Kotlin though all live inside the world of functional programming, and there is where I want to take you on this trip.</p>



<p>In this post, we will navigate the world of functional programming practically. We will do that by writing a straightforward rock-paper-scissor game. But we will do it differently than what most developers are used to in their daily work! We will use the concept of Domain-Specific Languages, and once we have our language designed, we will tackle the problem in a much more semantic way. I promise you won’t feel the pain of Haskell on this trip! Let’s start!</p>



<h2>Defining your language entities</h2>



<p>If we were to write the problem before understanding the abstractions that define it, we would probably write complicated code. In the case of a game like rock-paper-scissor, we have a move, and a move can be any of the three values. In Haskell, we can express that a move can be any of the three values as follows:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data Move = Rock
          | Paper
          | Scissor</pre>



<p>Since we are writing a console application, there are player turns for selecting their move, so we can also think of player turns:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data PlayerTurn = Player1
                | Player2</pre>



<p>I don’t think there are more entities in a turn-based, selection-based game. We can now proceed to the next step.</p>



<h2>Define your language interactions</h2>



<p>Entities relate to each other, and it wouldn’t be semantic if we had to implement the details of the interactions every time we used the entities. For that, we need to understand those interactions. First, moves should be comparable to each other, which means we can say one move is equal to another, or greater than another. Haskell allows us to have these implementations with the keywords Eq and Ord (Equivalent and Ordered). What those two keywords mean, is that we can now use the compare function, as well as all the order operators (e.g. &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, etc.).</p>



<p>There is one more aspect we need to consider. We expect users to select the moves based on their number, and if we don’t believe this data type to be enumerable, we will have to implement three conditions to transform data into our new Move data type. Another keyword enables us to use functions on top of our data types called Enum (Enumerable). The Enum keyword allows us to use two obvious functions to understand:´toEnum’ and ‘fromEnum’. They convert enum values to integers and vice-versa.</p>



<p>Let’s now implement these changes to our data types:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data Move = Rock
          | Paper
          | Scissor
          deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum)</pre>



<p>Unfortunately, we have a problem with one of these keywords. You see, if we don’t specify a custom order for our Move sub-types, the order of the sub-types will be the authority in all comparisons, so we must implement our version of comparison. To clarify this paragraph, since Rock appears before Scissor in the data definition above, it means that Rock’s value is less than Scissor, while it beats Scissor. Let’s write an instance of the Ord class, and write our comparison function!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">instance Ord Move where
  move1 &lt;= move2 = move1 `tiedWith` move2 || move1 `lostTo` move2</pre>



<p>The code above is still incomplete, but look how clear it is to understand the main idea. The benefit of top-down code writing is that anyone can read it. Now that we have the top definition, let’s dive deep and write the missing function references.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data Move = Rock
          | Paper
          | Scissor
          deriving (Eq, Enum)

instance Ord Move where
  move1 &lt;= move2 = move1 `tiedWith` move2 || move1 `lostTo` move2
    where tiedWith x y = x == y
          lostTo x y = (x, y) `elem` [(Rock, Paper),
                                      (Paper, Scissor),
                                      (Scissor, Rock)]</pre>



<p>There is one more code adjustment we want to bring to the table here. Still, it is the fact that it would be valuable to get the concept of converting PlayerTurn to integer and vice-versa, so let’s give it the enum class to our previously created data-type!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">data PlayerTurn = Player1
                | Player2
                deriving Enum</pre>



<p>Congratulations! You have now understood how to create your domain-specific language in two steps. First, you define your entities; then you define the relationships. Once it is ready, you can start writing code that glues everything together. It is prevalent for functional programmers to model state machines as DSLs, but since we are just writing a simple game, there is no need to make it complicated. Let’s now dive deep into writing the rest of the code.</p>



<h2>Implement it!</h2>



<p>The basic idea here will be to give the instructions on how to input moves to each player. We will do it turn-based, so we will first ask player 1 for their move input, and then player 2. Once both players have successfully inputted their moves, we can compare both movements and output the result. Since the idea here is understood, let’s write our ‘main’ function:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">main :: IO ()
main = do
  writeInstructions Player1
  player1Move &lt;- readMove
  writeInstructions Player2
  player2Move &lt;- readMove
  writeResult player1Move player2Move</pre>



<p>Crystal clear! There is no doubt about what we have written in the main function, but we still have some functions we need to write. They are: ‘writeInstructions’, ‘readMove’ and ‘writeResult’. The first one is straightforward to read and write as it deals with writing things on the console.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">writeInstructions :: PlayerTurn -&gt; IO ()
writeInstructions turn = do
  let playerNum = show $ (+1) $ fromEnum turn
  putStrLn $ "Player " ++ playerNum ++ " pick a move:"
  putStrLn "  0 = Rock"
  putStrLn "  1 = Paper"
  putStrLn "  2 = Scissor"</pre>



<p>This next one is a bit more complicated. The function ‘readMove’ reads values from the terminal, and since Haskell tries to be a pure functional language, it boxes values in what we call functors. To execute operations inside the box, we need a function called fmap, also called functor map. This fmap function has an alias, which is: &lt;$&gt;. This unique function executes operations inside the box, so we do that by using the composition of ‘toEnum’ followed by ‘read’. I know, this was the only complicated part of this article, but I promise that won’t affect your understanding of the general code.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">readMove :: IO Move
readMove = (toEnum . read) &lt;$&gt; getLine</pre>



<p>Finally, we can write the last function: ‘writeResult’. Since we have implemented our Ord class above, we can use the compare function output in a switch-like statement and give the outcomes that we want. Since the input suffers from the same IO problem as in the previous function, let’s separate the pure from the impure part, and write two functions:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">getResult :: Move -&gt; Move -&gt; String
getResult move1 move2 =
  let comparison = compare move1 move2
  in case comparison of
    GT -&gt; "Player 1 wins!"
    EQ -&gt; "It's a draw!"
    LT -&gt; "Player 2 wins!"

writeResult :: Move -&gt; Move -&gt; IO ()
writeResult move1 move2 = putStrLn $ getResult move1 move2</pre>



<h2>Final Result</h2>



<p>As you can see, our code ended up like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">module Main where

data Move = Rock
          | Paper
          | Scissor
          deriving (Eq, Enum)

instance Ord Move where
  move1 &lt;= move2 = move1 `tiedWith` move2 || move1 `lostTo` move2
    where tiedWith x y = x == y
          lostTo x y = (x, y) `elem` [(Rock, Paper),
                                      (Paper, Scissor),
                                      (Scissor, Rock)]

data PlayerTurn = Player1
                | Player2
                deriving Enum

writeInstructions :: PlayerTurn -&gt; IO ()
writeInstructions turn = do
  let playerNum = show $ (+1) $ fromEnum turn
  putStrLn $ "Player " ++ playerNum ++ " pick a move:"
  putStrLn "  0 = Rock"
  putStrLn "  1 = Paper"
  putStrLn "  2 = Scissor"

readMove :: IO Move
readMove = (toEnum . read) &lt;$&gt; getLine

getResult :: Move -&gt; Move -&gt; String
getResult move1 move2 =
  let comparison = compare move1 move2
  in case comparison of
    GT -&gt; "Player 1 wins!"
    EQ -&gt; "It's a draw!"
    LT -&gt; "Player 2 wins!"

writeResult :: Move -&gt; Move -&gt; IO ()
writeResult move1 move2 = putStrLn $ getResult move1 move2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  writeInstructions Player1
  player1Move &lt;- readMove
  writeInstructions Player2
  player2Move &lt;- readMove
  writeResult player1Move player2Move</pre>



<p>It is a bit overwhelming to switch to functional programming mindset. Still, once you understand the importance of modelling you DSLs before implementing code, you will start benefitting from the grace of functional programming languages.</p>



<p>If you take a close look at functions individually, you’ll see they are much closer to English than using imperative languages. Some cool functional languages like the LISP family allows us to write macros and extend the language features.</p>



<p>I hope you have enjoyed this Haskell journey!</p>

      <p><span>We’re witnessing a Silicon Valley exodus as the pandemic rages on and tech CEOs try to escape the city’s high taxes and left-wing politics, in search of a home base more suited to their needs.</span></p>
<p><span>The Karp-Thiel-Lonsdale Palantir trinity have all moved out of the bay area to Denver, LA, or Austin. Elon Musk moved Tesla’s headquarters to Austin, where many major tech companies already have satellite offices. Oracle relocated to Austin, as well, and Hewlett Packard recently announced it will move its global headquarters from Silicon Valley to Houston, the fourth-largest US city.</span></p>
<p><span>Texas is an appealing option for these companies, with no personal state income tax. But there are plenty of cities vying to beat out Austin in the race to become the next big tech hub.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hiring data across eight major tech companies including Google, Amazon, Paypal, Apple, Microsoft, Dell, eBay and Oracle shows a 128% increase in Austin-based job listings from last January to this month. The below chart shows significant growth beginning last summer.</span></p>

<p><span>Meanwhile, Nashville-based tech job openings soared over the last year. From January to October 2020, listings were up by almost 2,000%. (The chart below includes hiring data for Oracle, Paypal, eBay, Texas Instruments, and Alphabet, Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.)</span></p>

<p><span>Nashville will soon gain 100 more jobs from the arrival of Yoshi, a former Silicon Valley company that brings field techs to people’s cars for on-the-spot servicing. Company founder Brian Frist saw the obvious tax-related benefits from the move. His father is also former Tennessee senator Bill Frist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Denver is also seeing an influx of tech workers. The soon-to-be home to Palantir’s new headquarters have also drawn eyes from Dell and Oracle, both based in Texas. Dell has increased its job listings from just one in August to 57 this month, while Oracle counts 16 openings, up ten from July. Meanwhile, Amazon counts 123 Denver-based listings. From July to now, Palantir has gone from one to seven openings in Denver. Looking at Big Tech job listings in Denver collectively, openings have shot up roughly 500%.</span></p>

<p><span>People have bet on Raleigh, North Carolina as the next big tech hub because of its affordability and growing startup scene, but our data shows the city is falling behind in terms of hiring. Over the last year, Raleigh-based tech job openings have fallen by 33%.</span></p>

<p><span>Opportunity lies in cities like Richmond, Virginia and Madison, Wisconsin. Our data shows Richmond’s big tech job listings have grown 200% since last January, led by companies like eBay and Amazon. Madison’s tech hiring boost, with openings up 100% from last year, was also helped by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span>Calling Pittsburgh a tech hub would be a big stretch, but the underdog is on its way up, assisted by job listings at Google and Amazon. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stormy-times-15-us-cities-make-jobs-happen-george-anders/">LinkedIn data</a>, Pittsburgh is number 14 on the top cities with the most opportunities for job seekers. Our data shows Google and Amazon job listings in Pittsburgh increasing by 48% and 19% over the past year, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>Then of course we have the big tech cities that are only getting bigger as they absorb Silicon Valley migrants, but the speed of growth is slowing. Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle and currently has over 7,000 job listings in the area, has only increased its listings in the city by 4% over the past year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>That said, Apple and Oracle have increased hiring in the city significantly. Apple’s Seattle-based job listings are up by 71%, while Oracle’s have surged by 50%. From July to December of last year, Dell increased their Seattle listings by 71%. What’s more, Geekwire found that Seattle is becoming a destination for those fleeing the valley — the number of workers moving from the Bay Area to Seattle increased by 28%.</span></p>
<p><span>According to our data, Boston is a growing hotspot. Over the last two years, Boston-based job openings at tech companies like Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have skyrocketed. Collectively, giant tech entities have ramped up hiring efforts in Boston by over 1,000%. Boston’s tech hiring growth peaked last year along with the pandemic. (The chart below includes hiring data for Oracle, Paypal, eBay, Texas Instruments, and Alphabet, as well as Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.)</span></p>

<p><span>And then there’s Miami, where Amazon is leading an upward trend of tech hiring. According to the Information, a source who works with a person who knows Naval Ravikant, founder of tech investment site AngelList, said he heard Ravikant might be coming to Miami to “check it out.” Another person heard that Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has a meeting with Miami’s mayor, Francis Suarez.</span></p>
      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

January 11, 2021 | https://www.cppstories.com/2021/natvis-dbg-tip/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cppstories.com/2021/natvis-dbg-tip/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/natvisdbg.png" alt=""></p>  
          
        

<p>In Visual Studio, when you work with types from the C++ Standard Library or other common APIs, you might be familiar with a concise view of those objects in debugger. You can hover a mouse over an entity, and then the debugger presents short information about their current state. For example:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/vsdebugviewstr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Sometimes, the default view of objects in the debugger won’t be enough, especially if you operate on complex data structures. Fortunately, there’s a way to alter the view and write custom ones.</p>

<h2 id="visualizers-natvis">Visualizers - Natvis</h2>

<p>Before Visual Studio 2012 you could customise your objects’ debugging view by editing <code>autoexp.dat</code> file. It was a bit clumsy to use, though. Both the Automatic expansion of structures and avoid stepping into particular functions were configured using this file. Since VS 2012 we got a new framework called <strong>Natvis</strong> that uses XML to describe rules for debugging views.</p>

<p>For a simple example, let’s have a look at the following class:</p>

<pre><code>class SimpleParam {
public:
   SimpleParam(std::string str, int val) : mStr(std::move(str)), mVal(val) { }
    
    // some API
        
private:
    std::string mStr;
    int mVal{ 0 };
};
    
// in use:
SimpleParam input{ "number", 42 };
</code></pre>

<p>When we hit a breakpoint just after <code>input</code> is created, we might get the following view in Visual Studio 2019:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/customdbgviewParam.png" alt="Visual Studio 2019 default debugger view"></p>

<p>The view is not too bad. We can easily see all data members of <code>input</code>. But with <code>Natvis</code> we can create a custom view of that.</p>

<p>In the solution for the example project, there’s <code>NatvisFile.natvis</code> attached. It’s a per-project configuration for the debugger. Inside there’s the following definition:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;AutoVisualizer xmlns = "..."&gt;
    &lt;Type Name = "SimpleParam"&gt;
        &lt;DisplayString&gt;String: {mStr, sb}, Integer Value{ mVal }, StrLen{ strlen(&amp;mStr[0]) }&lt;/DisplayString&gt;
    &lt;Expand&gt;
        &lt;Item Name = "String"&gt;mStr, sb&lt; / Item&gt;
        &lt;Item Name = "Integer Value"&gt;mVal&lt; / Item&gt;
        &lt;/Expand&gt;
    &lt;/Type&gt;
&lt;/AutoVisualizer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What it does is a simple alteration of the view. It will add custom descriptions of the member fields and the string length information.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/customdbgviewParam2.png" alt="Visual Studio 2019 custom debugger view through the Natvis file"></p>

<p>Please note that there’s still <code>[Raw View]</code> option, that displays the default view.</p>

<p>Here are the things you can do with the framework:</p>

<ul>
<li>it works on exact types, derived types and even templates</li>
<li>you can change names, select variables to be shown</li>
<li>use expressions on variables (but not with side effects), some predefined Debugger intrinsic functions are available (like <code>strlen</code>)</li>
<li>use conditional expressions to show more/less information</li>
<li>show arrays, or even multi-dimensional arrays, linked lists structures</li>
<li>custom logic for traversing the structures</li>
<li>keep natvis files per project, or load them globally (just put it in something like <code>C:\Users\Admin\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Visualizers</code>)</li>
<li>you can see existing views for common STL types by looking at files in the following folder: <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers</code></li>
<li>if the file is attached to a project, then the debugger will dynamically reload it after re-saving (even while debugging!)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also enable diagnostics to see issues with your natvis file:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/natvisdbgout.PNG" alt=""></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <div>
            <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">   Prologue: getting muted in a a video conference <a href="#prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>As is the trend for many since 2020, I am working remote, and as a result in a lot of video conferences.</p>

<p>One silver lining with being remote is the ability to take notes: by nature of video conference, you’re in front of the computer, so it’s a lot easier to take notes on your computer without looking like you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>In one such meeting, I was notified how I was muted in the middle while someone else was talking: it turns out my keyboard noise was quite audible! How embarassing.</p>

<p>So thus started the quest to find the quietest keyboard possible.</p>
                <h2 id="whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">   What’s causing the noise when I type? <a href="#whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For context: I use an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ergodox-ez</a>. I didn’t realize it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoDoxEZ/comments/9ls494/ergodoxez_case_seems_very_loud/">loud noise with the Ergodox EZ is a common issue</a>.</p>

<p>On the ergodox-ez page, there is a lot of discussion around keyswitches (the thing that detects the key being pressed) and how much they affect noise. I chose the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html">Cherry MX Browns</a> since they are made to be silent, but still provide a tactile feel.</p>

<p>But after experimenting with different keyboards, removing some pieces, and changing my style, I’ve found that keyswitches are just one piece of the puzzle. The additional factors I found were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keycaps: the cap you put on the key switches. Once you put the keycap on, the clacking becomes louder, seemingly due to the resonation of the keys to the bottom of the switch.</li>
  <li>keyboard housing: the reverberation that occurs in the housing can be significant. This occurs while the key is being pressed, and even once it’s released.</li>
</ul>

<p>When holding a decibel meter up to where my microphone is during calls, and when typing a single key in a rhythmic fashion, I found that my ErgoDox produces noise of 62.8 decibels (dB) of loudness. My voice talking normally (and also much closer to the mic) is roughly 72 dB.</p>

<p>To be silent for practical purposes, the keyboard would have to produce below 40dB of noise: that’s roughly the loudness of a library.</p>
                <h2 id="keyboard-components-in-depth">   Keyboard components in depth <a href="#keyboard-components-in-depth">#</a>   </h2>
                    
                <h3 id="keycaps">   Keycaps <a href="#keycaps">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>As mentioned previously, keycaps are the cover for a key, and is often marked with the key that would be typed if pressed. A little research shows that <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69537.0">PBT plastic dampens higher frequencies</a>. These seemed to be loud in my case.</p>
                <h3 id="o-rings">   O-rings <a href="#o-rings">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>If your keypresses are loud, it’s common to just add o-rings (plastic rings that wrap the stem of your keycap) rather than brand by new switches. I’ve found the use of o-rings to be hit or miss, but generally they do play a part in reducing the noise of your keypresses, at the cost of the “feel” of your keys (the press feels a little squish at the bottom due to the ring being compressed rather than hitting whatever bottom it normally does).</p>
                <h3 id="key-switches">   Key switches <a href="#key-switches">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>Key Switches are the mechanical components which are responsible for “actuation”, in other words registering a key press.</p>

<p>There are a few general properties that can be used to categorize switches:</p>
                <h4 id="clicky-or-silent">   Clicky or silent <a href="#clicky-or-silent">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>If the switch is clicky, then the actuation includes a purposeful “click” sound. The click is actually not necessary to register the key press.</p>
                <h4 id="tactile-or-linear">   Tactile or linear <a href="#tactile-or-linear">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>For silent switches, tactile switches include physical feedback when the key is actuated. You feel a little resistance, and once that gives way you know you’ve pressed the button.</p>

<p>With a linear switch, the resistance is the same all the way through, which doesn’t give you a way to physically determine when the press was made.</p>
                <h4 id="travel-distance">   Travel distance <a href="#travel-distance">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The distance the switch travels between pressed and unpressed. Typically a few millimeters.</p>
                <h4 id="actuation-force">   Actuation force <a href="#actuation-force">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The total amount of force that must be applied to actuate the switch. The key will feel harder to press if the actuation force is higher.</p>
                <h4 id="my-conclusion-on-switches">   My Conclusion on Switches <a href="#my-conclusion-on-switches">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>I chose a switch with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest possible actuation force and travel distance. I tend to hit keys quite hard, and to minimize sound I need to try to actuate the key, but not actually “bottom out” and have my switch hit the bottom.</li>
  <li>Silent and linear attributes. Silent since the whole goal is to not make sound, and I found through testing that silent tactile switches result in additional noise when you hit the tactile feedback. The linear has no such noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the switch brand themselves, I found that Cherry MX, Gateron, and Kailh brand switches made roughly the same amount of noise. However, the <a href="https://zealpc.net/products/healio">ZealPC Healios</a> were orders of magnitude quieter in my HotDox. I’m not sure on exactly why, but it was impressive. Combined with the fact that they were linear switches, the Healios were the winner.</p>
                <h3 id="keyboard-housing">   Keyboard housing <a href="#keyboard-housing">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>The keyboard housing played a big part, based on my experiments (details below).</p>

<p>Housings that had less air inside produced less noise, since there wasn’t space for reverberation and the force of the keypress was more dampened by the material the keybaord was on.</p>

<p>Based on reviews, I read that the <a href="https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/">Hot Dox</a> keyboard was very silent (acrylic case with very little empty space inside). To further reduce any chance of reverberation, I added some <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-foam/products/kbdfans-module-foam">EVA foam</a> to fill the space between the PCB and the metallic cover on top.</p>

<p>There is also a material called <a href="https://www.sorbothane.com/">Sorbothane</a> that dampens things even better than foam, but I didn’t go that route because it would require hand-cutting it, and the material is hard to cut. If I tried to cut it without special equipment, I would probably end up with a rather uneven and unpleasent look.</p>
                <h3 id="material-keyboard-is-on">   Material keyboard is on <a href="#material-keyboard-is-on">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>I also found that the material the keyboard is on made a difference, although of a couple decibels. Typing on hard wood was louder. I read that using a keyboard / mousepad mat and putting your keyboard on top helps, so I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CP231W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">a cheap one on Amazon</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="experiments-with-different-scenarios">   Experiments with different scenarios <a href="#experiments-with-different-scenarios">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>To verify what I read, I tried to take some measurements with the loudness of various keyboards and configurations.</p>

<p>Although I originally tried to test the various scenarios with a decibel app on my phone, I found that the sensitivity wasn’t good enough to capture even relative differences between the different configurations. So I purchased a real decibel meter.</p>

<p>To measure the volume, I hovered the decibel meter about 3cm directly above the key being pressed. I pressed with the same rhythm, setting the decibel to “max” setting to capture the loudest the keypress ever is.</p>

<p>All experiments were with PBT Keycaps.</p>

<p>I started with a keyboard that was very loud (72.9 decibels), and was able to finish with a setup that was roughly 20dB quieter! Although the real noise reduction may be lower due to the microphone being more than 3cm away from the keyboard, the relative comparison is going from a noisy restaurant (70db) to a quiet office (50db).</p>

<p>My final build is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PBT keycaps (my particular set is no longer made, so no link)</li>
  <li><a href="https://zealpc.net/products/healio">ZealPC Healios switches</a></li>

</ul>

  <p>SEC Investor Education:</p>

  <p>New Year’s Financial Resolution: Avoid too-good-to-be-true “investments” with Ponzi scheme “red flag” claims like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“To the moon! To the mars!”</li>
    <li>“Number go up!”</li>
    <li>“Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!”</li>
    <li>“Could quadruple in 2021 and rally to $100,000!”</li>

</blockquote>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Some “unpopular” bitcoin facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster</li>
  <li>Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters’ Greed Fest</li>
  <li>The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!</li>
  <li>Bitcoin Is Comedy Gold - Bitcoin Is the New Standard?! - LOL</li>
  <li>When Will the Music Stop? (Hint: Try to Cash Out)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what!?  Do your own research! Here we go:</p>

<p><strong>SCAM ALERT! SCAM ALERT! SCAM ALERT!</strong></p>

<p>These notes begin at defining a life goal, transition to thinking about a career, then whether you should join a startup, what company you should join, how to apply, and how to decide between offers/companies.</p>
<p>Given the significant proportion of time you spend on your career, it's worth some thought. This is an attempt at a deliberate understatement.</p>
<p><em>One "quick" hack to optimize your career: put in a lot of thought and think long term.</em></p>
<p><strong>Summary of advice:</strong></p>
<p>Through lots of research and reflection, find a company where you feel like you "have" to join.</p>
<p>Be so good (and persistent) that they can't ignore you (assuming you have runway, spend 1+ months convincing the company that you will add value to them by working for free / showing up and offering to help / etc).</p>
<h3 id="step-0">Step 0: What should I do with my life?</h3>
<p>Here are some opinions. These aren't intended to provide an answer directly, but they may provoke you to think of an answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For me the very existence and possibility of human knowledge provides the answer to the question of why we are here and what we should try to accomplish in life. We should endeavor to contribute to knowledge. Given my definition this can mean a great many things, including teaching and making music and taking care of others. Anything that either adds to or reproduces knowledge is, so far, a uniquely human activity and why we are here (â€œaddingâ€� includes questioning or even invalidating existing knowledge).

<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233/">Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At around age fourteen, Musk had a full-on existential crisis. He tried to deal with it like many gifted adolescents do, turning to religious and philosophical texts. Musk sampled a handful of ideologies and then ended up more or less back where he had started, embracing the sci-fi lessons found in one of the most influential books in his life: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. "He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask," Musk said. "Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask."</p>
<p>The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. "The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment," he said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moral of this story (told to me by Liam Casey of PCH International, who heard it in China) is that money and success arenâ€™t everything, and that you need to know what youâ€™re aiming for before beginning on an endeavor. We often get caught up in false ambition and forget why we wanted to do something in the first place. That lapse of memory costs us the joy of something that got us started.</p>
<p>Today it is easy to learn about starting a business. You can get practical advice and to-do lists at the click of a button. However, what you canâ€™t get from others is the understanding about why you are doing what you are doing and toward what end. If only I had heard this story earlier, I would have made fewer â€” or perhaps different â€” mistakes.</p>

<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/bez0int-1">interview with Jeff Bezos</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a young person came to you for advice, "How do I make the most out of my life?" what would you say to them?</p>
<p>Do something you're very passionate about, and don't try to chase what is kind of the 'hot passion' of the day. I think we actually saw this. I think you see it all over the place in many different contexts, but I think we saw it in the Internet world quite a bit, where, at sort of the peak of the Internet mania in -- say 1999 -- you found people who were very passionate of something, and they kind of left that job and decided, "I'm going to do something on the Internet because it's almost like the 1849 Gold Rush in a way." I mean, you find that people -- if you go back and study the history of the 1949 Gold Rush you find that, at that time, everybody who was within shouting distance of California was -- you know, they might have been a doctor, but they quit being a doctor and they started panning for gold, and that almost never works. And, even if it does work, according to some metric, financial success, or whatever it might be, I suspect it leaves you ultimately unsatisfied. So, you really need to be very clear with yourself. And I think one of the best ways to do that is this notion of projecting yourself forward to age 80, looking back on your life, and trying to make sure you've minimized the number of regrets you have. That works for career decisions. It works for family decisions. I have a 14-month old son, and it's very easy for me to -- if I think about myself when I'm 80, I know I want to watch that little guy grow up, and so it's -- I don't want to be 80 and think, "Shoot! You know, I missed that whole thing, and I don't have the kind of relationship with my son that I wished I had," and so on and so on. </p>
<p>Another thing that I would recommend to people is that they always take a long-term point of view. I think this is something about which there's a lot of controversy. A lot of people -- and I'm just not one of them -- believe that you should live for the now. I think what you do is think about the great expanse of time ahead of you and try to make sure that you're planning for that in a way that's going to leave you ultimately satisfied. This is the way it works for me. There are a lot of paths to satisfaction and you need to find one that works for you.</p>

<h4>What makes one happy?</h4>
<p>Post from The Breakout List, <a href="https://medium.com/@BreakoutList/breakout-careers-and-the-science-of-happiness-d1f924822ba1">Happiness science for breakout careers</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coherent story: Understand your life in terms of a coherent story. Seriously, attempt to write out the main points of a novel that may be written about your life.</p>
<p>Goals: Frame career goals in terms of relationships and generativity (leaving legacy and contributing to society), instead of wealth and achievement.</p>
<p>Virtues: Seek to work at companies with virtuous individuals. Wise, courageous, humane, just, temperate, and transcendent people.</p>
<p>Conditions: Avoid environments with uncontrollable noise, especially if the noise is variable. Seek a short commute. Seek a job where you can exercise some aspects of control, even if minute. Ensure that you mend conflicts in interpersonal relationships. Iâ€™d suggest learning active listening for that.</p>
<p>Seek flow: Clear challenges that fully engage you, where you have the skills to meet the challenge, and somehow get immediate feedback on how you are doing. Some programming tasks are especially suited to states of flow. Do tasks that engage your strengths.</p>
<p>Build relationships: Express gratitude to people who have helped you at work or in your career. Write gratitude letters. Join or start a group with coworkers or people from your industry that meets weekly or monthly to share an activity.</p>
<p>Reframe as a calling: In conjunction with point #1, try to see how your work fits into a worthy larger undertaking.</p>

<h4>What does it take to be successful?</h4>
<p>Excerpt from interview with <a href="http://www.gq.com/sports/201503/kobe-bryant-nba-allstar?currentPage=2">Kobe Bryant by GQ</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So how much are you willing to give up? Have you given up the possibility of having friends? Do you have any friends?</em></p>
<p>I have "like minds." You know, I've been fortunate to play in Los Angeles, where there are a lot of people like me. Actors. Musicians. Businessmen. Obsessives. People who feel like God put them on earth to do whatever it is that they do. Now, do we have time to build great relationships? Do we have time to build great friendships? No. Do we have time to socialize and to hangout aimlessly? No. Do we want to do that? No.We want to work. I enjoy working.</p>
<p><em>So is this a choice? Are you actively choosing not to have friends?</em></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. I have friends. But being a "great friend" is something I will never be. I can be a good friend. But not a great friend. A great friend will call you every day and remember your birthday. I'll get so wrapped up in my shit, I'll never remember that stuff. And the people who are my friends understand this, and they're usually the same way. You gravitate toward people who are like you. But the kind of relationships you see in moviesâ€”that's impossible for me. I have good relationships with players around the league. LeBron and I will text every now and then. KG and I will text every now and then. But in terms of having one of those great, bonding friendshipsâ€”that's something I will probably never have. And it's not some smug thing. It's a weakness. It's a weakness.</p>

January 11, 2021 | http://doc.replicated.cc:8080/%5EWiki/owner.sm | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://doc.replicated.cc:8080/%5EWiki/owner.sm">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>The <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc:8080/%5EWiki/ron.sm">Replicated Object Notation</a> is a format for live data.
RON is op-based, CRDT-friendly and mostly implies causal consistency.
That approach to data brings quite a lot of change!
One well known text discussing those changes is the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">Local-First Software</a> manifesto by the brilliant Ink&amp;Switch team.
Another way to describe RON's approach is to oversimplify it: RON is like "<code>git</code> for data".
In this essay, I would like to focus on the changes RON may bring to data ownership.</p>
<p>Let's start with the concept of net neutrality.
It is an extension of the earlier concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">common carrier</a> that simply means: if you perform logistical services for the general public, you can not discriminate.
All bytes are sent equal!
The interesting part is that the concept of a common carrier applies to transport and communication networks alike.</p>
<p>But let's look at it from the following angle: does network neutrality apply to <em>storage</em>?
Generally, the functions of transport and storage are hard to separate. Any logistical network has some storage capacity. Once a truck is parked, it is storage.
For a physicist, transport moves things through space, while storage moves them through time, but neither function can be pure, so they both route things in spacetime.</p>
<p>Back to our Internets, both "pipes" (ISPs) and "buckets" (Big Tech) perform a logistical role: they route the information from the sender to the receiver, one way or another.
Actually, Big Tech runs a lot of fiber and ISP quite often run some caches.
There are also players in between: CDNs.</p>
<p>But, if we compare the ownership picture for "pipes" and "buckets", it is dramatically different.
ISPs are subjected to the Network Neutrality principle.
The data is additionally protected by crypto; ISPs can't mess with it.
Meanwhile, the "buckets" effectively own the data they carry!
Namely, they are free to monetize that data in any way possible.
They may reject access to the data or erase it altogether.
In my vocabulary, that amounts to ownership.</p>
<p>That is <em>a lot</em> of imbalance!</p>
<p>So, how RON and other local-first projects can help here?</p>
<p>There are some historical and engineering related underpinnings to that asymmetry. The classic data replication theory is build on the idea of a <em>master</em> replica and one-way replication.
The <em>master</em> is basically the central server that keeps (and effectively owns) the data. Yet another term for it is "the source of truth". Your master is your source of truth! Feels a bit uncomfortable? It certainly is...</p>
<p>What RON/CRDT changes here is the absence of any privileged bucket. The data has an <em>origin</em>, but no master. That origin is likely some end-user device. Meanwhile, the buckets are the same as pipes, just some mutually-replaceable plumbing!</p>
<p>This way, the existence of a Big Data Bucket is just a matter of convenience. There might be multiple buckets and you might work with some superposition of those buckets (again, think <code>git</code>).
That brings quite a many interesting concepts we might know from other domains of knowledge, e.g. content remixing as a valid form of creativity.</p>
<p>Once you grasp this concept, you might see the present Big Tech situation as an anomaly... or an anachronism.
If a landlord <em>owns</em> the tenants, is it feudalism or slavery?</p>
<p>So, RON may bring quite a lot of change here.</p>
<p>Please follow the author on <a href="http://twitter.com/gritzko">twitter</a> as he did not create a RON based microblogging service yet.
(Cause he was busy creating a RON based revision control system and <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc:8080/%5EWiki/what_is_this.sm">this</a> RON based wiki.)</p>

Signal Messenger LLC. is the company that makes the Signal app.
They are funded by the Signal Foundation which is a non-profit organization that relies on <a href="https://signal.org/donate/">your donations</a> to make the app free and not have ulterior motives with your data.</p><p>The foundation’s mission is</p><blockquote><p>To develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.</p></blockquote><p>The Signal app is all <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">open source on GitHub</a> and their protocols are well documented and available <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">on their website</a>.</p><p>But that’s not why you’re here.
Let’s show you some tips to get the most out of your new secure messaging app.</p><h2 id="important-settings">Important settings</h2><p>Signal is great, but there are a few things you may want to change depending on how secure or private you want your communications.</p><h3 id="notifications">Notifications.</h3><p>You can disable what is shown in notifications to help with privacy.
Turn off whatever you don’t want shown.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-notification-content.png" alt=""></p><p>You may also want to disable the notification you get when one of your contacts join Signal.
Especially ad the rapid pace people are joining.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-contact-notifications.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3><p>You can set the Signal app to lock when your phone locks under privacy.
It may also be a good idea to enable incognito keyboard which will ask your keyboard to remove personalization while typing.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-privacy.png" alt=""></p><p>You can turn off read receipts, typing indicators, and automatic link previews under the communication settings.
Link previews only work on <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360022474332-Link-Previews">sites that use <code>https://</code></a></p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-communication-settings.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="chats-and-media">Chats and media</h3><p>In chats you can change when to auto-download files.
Some of these can be quite large so it may be a good idea to only automatically download on Wi-Fi.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-media-download.png" alt=""></p><p>At the very bottom of Chats and media is a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages">message backup option</a>.
The backup is encrypted and stored locally on your phone.
If you’re using a backup service for your phone they will also be backed up to the cloud which you may or may not want (even if it’s encrypted).</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-chat-backups.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="linked-devices">Linked devices</h3><p>You can use Signal from another device including tablets and laptops.
Install the Signal app on the other device and it will show a QR code.
Open the linked devices setting and click the + button at the bottom.
Scan the QR code and you’re all set.</p><p>If you tap on an existing linked device you have the option to remove it from being able to send or receive messages.
Be aware that any existing messages on the device may still be available and cached on the device.
This setting is not a “secure wipe.”</p><h2 id="chats-and-calls">Chats and calls</h2><p>Signal chats work similarly to traditional SMS messaging apps.
You can send text, emoji, and stickers, or attach pictures, gifs (searched from giphy), files, contacts, or locations.
You can record voice messages by holding the microphone.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-message-attach.png" alt=""></p><p>You can also make audio or video calls when you select a contact and click the icons in the top banner.
All calls are encrypted and can optionally go through a relay server so you do not expose your IP address to the recipient.
You can enable the relay server in settings -&gt; privacy -&gt; communication.</p><p>A relay is a server that Signal controls that your call will go through.
Similar to a VPN in the way it would expose the server IP to the recipient without exposing your IP.
If you’re interested in the Signal server architecture you can check out <a href="https://sorincocorada.ro/signal-messanger-architecture/">this post</a>.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-relay-calls.png" alt=""></p><p>A single hallow check box next to a message you sent means your message was sent.
Two check marks means the message was delivered.
Once the recipient reads the message the check marks will fill in.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-double-checks-hallow.png" alt="">
<img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-doublechecks-filled.png" alt=""></p><p>If you see a little person icon next to the person’s name in chat it means that person is in your contacts.
If you want their name to automatically be filled out you can go into your phone’s contacts and add the number to a contact.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-contact.png" alt=""></p><p>If you open a chat you can look in settings and enable disappearing messages.
This is super helpful to prevent messages persisting.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-disappearing.png" alt=""></p><p>You can—and should—verify a contact to make sure you’re really talking to them.
This verifies the encryption keys used at both ends of the conversation.
You can do that manually or automatically by scanning their QR code.</p><p>Ideally you will do this verification out-of-band from Signal either in person or through some other video/image sharing service.
Facetime, zoom, etc. are great options if you can’t meet in person.</p><p>Once you verify a contact you’ll see “Verified” text under their name.
If you manually mark the contact as verified it will show a message in the chat that you marked them verified.</p><h3 id="group-messages">Group messages</h3><p>You can create a group message from the main screen clicking the pencil and then “New group.”</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-new-group.png" alt=""></p><p>Add contacts to the group and you’re ready to go.</p><p>You have similar settings to 1:1 chats.
You can have a group video call with up to 8 people and a group chat with up to 150 people—RIP notifications!
If you want to have a group call without video you need to start a video call and disable your camera before you join.</p><p>You can change who can invite people to the group or make a group link easier for someone to share if they’re not in your contacts.</p><p>The links are public but an admin needs to approve members joining the group by default.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-group-link.png" alt=""></p><p>Group video calls work the same way as 1:1 calls but groups don’t have audio only calls—although you can disable your video in a video call.</p><h2 id="other-things-to-consider">Other things to consider</h2><p>If you want to use signal without giving out your real phone number you can use a service like twilio that will provide you a forwarding number.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://mshelton.medium.com/using-signal-without-giving-your-phone-number-3a575580f652">this great guide</a> on how to set it up.</p><h3 id="your-safety-number-has-changed">Your safety number has changed</h3><p>If you see this seemingly scary message don’t be alarmed.
It likely just means the <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">person on the other end of the conversation</a> got a new phone or re-installed Signal.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-safety-number.png" alt=""></p><p>You can still verify the persons safety number to make sure there is no man-in-the-middle attacks.
This is distinctly different than how iMessage and Telegram work because in both of those apps they store your private key.</p><h3 id="pins">Pins</h3><p>Pins are important because they will enable Signal to get rid of phone number requirements.</p><p>The <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN">support page</a> says it best</p><blockquote><p>Your Signal PIN is a code used to support features like non-phone number based identifiers.

January 11, 2021 | https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>(Day 10 of <a href="https://aduros.com/blog/30-days-of-blogging">30 Days of Blogging</a>)</p>
<p>A couple months back I switched my terminal from xfce4-terminal to the venerable xterm. For some
reason I always put xterm in the same bucket as xclock, xmessage, or any other prehistoric command
starting with X that comes pre-installed on any graphical Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It was surprising to learn that xterm is still very much <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html">actively
developed</a>. Even more surprisingly, it turns out
xterm has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">incredibly low input latency</a> compared to modern
terminals. This is easy to test at home, try typing in xterm compared to any other terminal and feel
how much snappier it is.</p>
<p>The lower latency alone is worth the price of admission in my opinion, so I went about configuring
xterm as my default terminal. The configuration goes in <code>~/.Xresources</code> and you need to run <code>xrdb ~/.Xresources</code> after every change, or <a href="https://github.com/aduros/dotfiles/blob/eab476fc62e74e46cb41bb5c094cede7a28a014f/home/.config/nvim/options.vim#L27">make vim do
it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>Here are some “modern” sensible defaults I ended up landing on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Sensible defaults
XTerm.vt100.locale: false
XTerm.vt100.utf8: true
XTerm.vt100.scrollTtyOutput: false
XTerm.vt100.scrollKey: true
XTerm.vt100.bellIsUrgent: true
XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true
</code></pre></div><p>And here are some visual styling options, not including colors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Styling
XTerm.vt100.faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
XTerm.vt100.boldMode: false
XTerm.vt100.faceSize: 11
XTerm.vt100.internalBorder: 16
XTerm.borderWidth: 0
</code></pre></div><p>XTerm supports key binding, but the syntax is non-obvious:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;N: scroll-back(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;T: scroll-forw(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
</code></pre></div><p>This allows copying and pasting to the clipboard (not just the X selection) with shift-ctrl-C and V.
It also allows scrolling up and down with shift-ctrl-N and T (you can switch this to K and J to
match vim keys in Qwerty).</p>
<h2 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h2>
<p>So now we have a pretty usable setup, but there’s one more incredibly useful feature that was hard
to figure out: opening URLs in the browser. We could of course select the URL and copy-paste, but
there’s a better way.</p>
<p>XTerm has a configuration option called <code>printerCommand</code> which is a command that is piped all the
text currently visible in the terminal. As the name suggests, it’s meant to be used to implement
printing to physical paper, but we can save the trees and hijack it to instead scan the screen for
URLs and open the browser:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>#!/bin/sh -e
</span><span></span>
grep -Eo <span>'\bhttps?://\S+\b'</span> |
    uniq |
    ifne rofi -dmenu -i -p <span>"Open URL"</span> -auto-select |
    xargs xdg-open
</code></pre></div><p>This greps for URLs, removes consecutive duplicates with <code>uniq</code>, and displays a
<a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> menu to choose between them if there were multiple URLs.
<code>ifne</code> is included in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/moreutils">moreutils</a>. Put this
script in an executable file called <code>select-url</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> and then add this to <code>.Xresources</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.printerCommand: select-url

XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;W: print(noAttrs, noNewLine)
</code></pre></div><p>Now when you press shift-ctrl-W, any URL shown in the terminal will open in the browser. You don’t
have to select anything or use your mouse at all, nice!</p>
<p>Someday it would be great to improve <code>select-url</code> to also scan for email addresses. Maybe during the
next pandemic…</p>
<h2 id="peeking-at-the-alternate-screen">Peeking at the Alternate Screen</h2>
<p>Sometimes you open a fullscreen application like vim or a man page and you need to refer back to
some text on the shell. Use this keybind to toggle back and forth:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;H: set-altscreen(toggle)
</code></pre></div><p>You can even use it view a previously opened vim or man page after you close out of it!</p>
<h2 id="opening-new-terminals-at-the-current-directory">Opening New Terminals at the Current Directory</h2>
<p>There’s a keybind action called <code>spawn-new-terminal()</code> that can be used for this, but even better is
using <a href="https://github.com/schischi/xcwd">xcwd</a> to get the working directory of any currently focused
window. Then you can put this in your i3 config for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">bindsym $mod+Return exec --no-startup-id cd "`xcwd`" &amp;&amp; xterm
</code></pre></div><h2 id="wish-list">Wish List</h2>
<p>XTerm is missing a few small features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text reflow when the terminal is resized.</li>
<li>Fallback fonts don’t seem to always work. Maybe I’m missing a config option?</li>
<li>Transparency not natively supported. I don’t care about transparency but maybe it’s important to
some people.</li>
<li>Occasionally strange flickering with <a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom">picom</a>, possibly a bug
with picom?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end this wasn’t enough to stop me from using xterm, but the lack of text reflow still irks me
from time to time. Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with xterm after taking the time to
configure it.</p>

<p>The demand for fish as a source of meat increases by an average of 6% each year—making it the most rapidly growing food in the meat industry. This demand has doubled since the start of the 2000s and will double again by 2050 if the current growth rate holds.</p>
<p>Fish-farming has been expanding to meet this demand by increasing the number of fish within their facilities. However, as the fish become more closely packed: their quality of life decreases.</p>
<p>Maintaining a high quality-of-life requires the following needs to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>A low rate of sea-lice (Lepeiopthteirus Salmonis) infestation</li>
<li>low levels of the stress hormone Cortisol</li>
<li>The ideal level of food (and timed food delivery) </li>
<li>An appropriate biomass size</li>
<li>Well maintained mesh nets that keep the fish enclosed (and predators out)</li>
<li>A careful water quality balance </li>
<li>low rates of disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, quality-of-life decreases exponentially as fish-farms become depleted. This is because of the relationship between these factors and space (less space = more transference of sea-lice, disease, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="why-will-this-benefit-the-fish-farms-"><a href="#why-will-this-benefit-the-fish-farms-" aria-label="why will this benefit the fish farms  permalink"></a>WHY WILL THIS BENEFIT THE FISH FARMS? 💰</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feeding costs 60% of fisheries revenue. Unreasonable feeding can be a significant factor in revenue <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/raq.12202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de Verdal et al., 2017</a></li>
<li>Manually selecting features is a laborious, heuristic approach, and the effects highly dependent on both luck and experience (Mohanty et al., 2016)</li>
<li>DL models have shown strong stability under challenging conditions such as low light and high noise, and they perform better than do traditional artificial feature extraction methods (Sun et al., 2018)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-do-execute-"><a href="#how-do-we-do-execute-" aria-label="how do we do execute  permalink"></a>HOW DO WE DO EXECUTE? 🤔</h2>
<p>Most fish farms have little, if any, technological support and tight budgets. Therefore, any solution must be easy to install and low cost.</p>
<p>Our Deep Learning solution requires only one piece of equipment—a camera with measurement instruments integrated into it. One well place instrument in the center of a fish farm can collect and aggregate all of the data required to monitor the seven quality-of-life metrics mentioned above. When combined, these metrics can also produce a single overall health value of the fish farm, representing a holistic at-a-glance health rating.</p>
<p>Using the aforementioned aggregated data along with computer vision, we can develop the following Deep Learning applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea-Lice Detection</li>
<li>Behavioral Analysis of Fish</li>
<li>Dynamic Fish Appetite Estimation and Delivery </li>
<li>Biomass Measurement</li>
<li>Mesh Integrity Monitoring</li>
<li>Water Quality Monitoring and Control</li>
<li>Disease Identification and Prevention</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us briefly breakdown everything so far before we jump into the applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>we can utilize aggregated data from a single piece of equipment in <strong>seven different applications</strong>—each dedicated to a critical factor in fish quality-of-life</li>
<li>each application uses similar Deep Learning technologies but <strong>results in a unique reporting value</strong> that fish farmers can take action on</li>
<li><strong>the seven outputs can be combined in one final Deep Learning application</strong> which represents the overall health of the farm</li>
</ol>
<p>Now imagine these seven metrics, related measurements, and overall health evaluation displayed in real-time via a beautiful dashboard! 📈</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves"><a href="#problem-it-solves" aria-label="problem it solves permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Fish farms worldwide suffer from infestations of sea-lice. These parasites attach themselves to a fish host and feed off their skin/blood. The denser the fish farm—the easier it becomes for sea-lice to spread. </p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem" aria-label="how it solves the problem permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Harsh chemical treatments have become the most common method of sea-lice removal. While effective at removing sea-lice, the chemical treatment has adverse effects on the fish. It also prevents the Salmon from being sold for several weeks while they detox. </p>
<p>A deep learning solution utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision to detect/identify sea-lice before they spread over to the other fish enable farmers to take actions such as (<strong>what, moving fish populations or temporarily reducing density?</strong>) before critical population levels of sea-lice trigger a complete chemical flush. </p>
<h5 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="summary permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Sea lice can cause catastrophic damage to commercial fish-farms. If not kept in check, fish can not be sold due to lesions caused by the parasites, and in some extreme cases, lice can also cause the fish to die. Early prevention using the deep learning system can prevent harmful chemicals and keep the lice population in check.</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves-1"><a href="#problem-it-solves-1" aria-label="problem it solves 1 permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Small environment changes can rapidly increase stress levels for fish, thereby increasing quantities of the stress hormone Cortisol inside them. Cortisol alters the taste of the fish and has negative ramifications (<strong>such as what</strong>) for the consumer.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-1"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-1" aria-label="how it solves the problem 1 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>The IdTracker.ai model leverages two different CNNs to provide the capability for tracking all individual fish behaviors in small and large groups—allowing farmers to detect behavior anomalies associated with increased Cortisol. However, the challenge remains enormous since tracking individual fish behaviors involves non-rigid deformations, low image quality, and frequent occlusions.</p>
<p>Zhao et al. (2018a) has demonstrated another solution that utilizes <strong>modified motion influence maps</strong> and <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> to systematically detect, localize, and recognize unusual behaviors within a fish school.</p>
<h5 id="summary-1"><a href="#summary-1" aria-label="summary 1 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Fishes react rapidly to the smallest changes in their environment, such as Dissolved Oxygen, algae, phytoplankton, etc. If the fishes are stressed, they can produce cortisol, which affects fish meat quality. Analyzing behavior and fish swimming patterns help farmers make smarter decisions.</p>

<p>No metric has a stronger correlation to production efficiency and breeding cost than fish feeding. Feeding accounts for 60% of the average fish farm’s operations budget.</p>
<p>Insufficient feeding drastically lowers the fish breeding/biomass growth rates, while overfeeding results in wasted costs and pollution of the surrounding water environment.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-2"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-2" aria-label="how it solves the problem 2 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Nailing the optimal feeding times and delivery size can be challenging. Traditionally, farmers use simple timers and intuitive experience to make their decisions—which does not consider important environmental and nutritional factors.</p>
<p>Aggregated data containing visual information, water measurements, and historical data on fish responses to past feedings can be combined with 3D-CNN and RNN models geared for temporal/spatial data flow to generate drastically more efficient feeding. Maloy et a. utilized this dual-network approach to choose optimal feeding times that accounted for feeding and non-feeding behaviors.</p>
<h5 id="summary-2"><a href="#summary-2" aria-label="summary 2 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Many aquaculture farms have random times for feeding. Some farmers use feed based on intuition. When this happens, fish can be over or underfed. Overuse of feed leads to wasted costs and pollution of the environment, and underfeeding lower growth rates. Detecting appetite lets farmers control when to feed the fish.</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves-3"><a href="#problem-it-solves-3" aria-label="problem it solves 3 permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Estimating biomass forms the basis for sustainably managing a fish-farm as provides farmers an insight into the quantity, size, and weight of the current fish. These crucial data points also drive decision making related to feeding and behavioral management.</p>
<p>Measuring biomass can be challenging without human intervention as the fish move freely in an environment where lighting and visibility conditions can not be controlled. Depending on the depth of the fish, different degrees of occlusion and light change need to be accounted for.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-3"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-3" aria-label="how it solves the problem 3 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Two possible solutions can come together to accurately estimate biomass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Train a Deep Learning algorithm to understand the mapping between sonar and optical images</li>
<li>Segment images of individual fish, track them over time, and continuously estimate volume and weight through changes in the fish using the depth of the object within the frame. </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="summary-3"><a href="#summary-3" aria-label="summary 3 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Estimating Biomass helps Farmers make better decisions about the size, quality, and weight of fish. Currently, this process is done manually and is labor/cost-intensive. Automating this process will save farmers time and money.</p>

<p>Specially designed mesh nets fence the farmed fish into a confined area and ensure their safety/health. Farmed fish escaping the farm would be disastrous for the farm as well as the nearby ecosystem.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-4"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-4" aria-label="how it solves the problem 4 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Currently, divers perform a “net integrity check” in which they SCUBA around the farm’s perimeter and check nodes in the netting for signs of wear. Hiring professional divers or owning the equipment to perform the dives can be an arduous/expensive process.</p>
<p>A deep learning neural network trained to recognize nodes in the netting can easily create rules for placement and monitoring of the mesh nets.</p>
<h5 id="summary-4"><a href="#summary-4" aria-label="summary 4 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Current Fjords and other aquaculture nets can be broken. If this happens, hundreds of thousands of fish will escape into the nearby environment devastating the ecosystem. Divers currently routinely inspect mesh nets but automating net break detection will save the farms much money and save the ocean from further harm.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to ScheerPost</p>



<p>Shortly after WikiLeaks released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/irq/">the Iraq War Logs</a> in October 2010, which documented numerous US war crimes — including video images of the gunning down of two Reuters journalists and 10 other unarmed civilians in <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">the Collateral Murder video</a>, the routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, the covering up of thousands of civilian deaths and the killing of nearly 700 civilians that had approached too closely to US checkpoints — the towering civil rights attorneys Michael Ratner and Len Weinglass, who had defended Daniel Ellsberg in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.archives.gov/research/pentagon-papers" target="_blank">Pentagon Papers</a> case, met Julian Assange in a studio apartment in Central London, according to <a href="https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/moving-the-bar/">Ratner’s newly released memoir “Moving the Bar”</a>.</p>



<p>Assange had just returned to London from Sweden where he had attempted to create the legal framework to protect WikiLeaks’ servers in Sweden.&nbsp; Shortly after his arrival in Stockholm, his personal bank cards were blocked.&nbsp; He had no access to funds and was dependent on supporters.&nbsp; Two of these supporters were women with whom he had consensual sex.&nbsp; As he was preparing to leave, the Swedish media announced that he was wanted for questioning about allegations of rape. The women, who never accused Assange of rape, wanted him to take an STD test.&nbsp; They had approached the police about compelling him to comply. “I did not want to put any charges on Julian Assange,” texted one of them on August 20 while she was still at the police station, but “the police were keen on getting their hands on him.” She said she felt “railroaded by the police.” Within 24 hours the chief prosecutor of Stockholm took over the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; He dropped the rape accusation, stating “I don’t believe there is any reason to suspect that he has committed rape.” Assange, although not charged with a crime, cancelled his departure and remained in Sweden for another five weeks to cooperate with the investigation.&nbsp; A special prosecutor, Marianne Ny, was appointed to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct.&nbsp; Assange was granted permission to leave the country.&nbsp; He flew to Berlin.&nbsp; When Assange arrived in Berlin three encrypted laptops with documents detailing US war crimes had disappeared from his luggage.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We consider the Swedish allegations a distraction,” Ratner told Assange, according to his memoir. “We’ve read the police reports, and we believe the authorities don’t have a case. We’re here because in our view you are in much more jeopardy in the US Len [Weinglass] can explain why.”</p>



<p>Assange, Ratner recalled, remained silent.</p>



<p> “WikiLeaks and you personally are facing a battle that is both legal and political,” Weinglass told Assange. “As we learned in the Pentagon Papers case, the US government doesn’t like the truth coming out. And it doesn’t like to be humiliated. No matter if it’s Nixon or Bush or Obama, Republican or Democrat in the White House. The US government will try to stop you from publishing its ugly secrets. And if they have to destroy you and the First Amendment and the rights of publishers with you, they are willing to do it. We believe they are going to come after WikiLeaks and you, Julian, as the publisher.”</p>



<p>“Come after me for what?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“Espionage,” Weinglass continued, according to the memoir. “They’re going to charge Bradley Manning with treason under the Espionage Act of 1917. We don’t think it applies to him because he’s a whistleblower, not a spy. And we don’t think it applies to you either because you are a publisher. But they are going to try to force Manning into implicating you as his collaborator. That’s why it’s crucial that WikiLeaks and you personally have an American criminal lawyer to represent you.”</p>



<p>Ratner and Weinglass laid out potential scenarios.</p>



<p>“The way it could happen,” Ratner said, “is that the Justice Department could convene a secret grand jury to investigate possible charges against you. It would probably be in northern Virginia, where everyone on the jury would be a current or retired CIA employee or have worked for some other part of the military-industrial complex. They would be hostile to anyone like you who’d published US government secrets. The grand jury could come up with a sealed indictment, issue a warrant for your arrest, and request extradition.”</p>



<p>“What happens if they extradite me?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“They fly you to where the indictment is issued,” Weinglass told Assange. “Then they put you into some hellhole in solitary, and you get treated like Bradley Manning. They put you under what they call special administrative measures, which means you probably would not be allowed communication with anyone. Maybe your lawyer could go in and talk to you, but the lawyer couldn’t say anything to the press.”</p>



<p> “And it’s very, very unlikely that they would give you bail,” Ratner added.</p>



<p>“Is it easier to extradite from the UK or from Sweden?” asked Sarah Harrison, who was at the meeting.</p>



<p> “We don’t know the answer to that,” Ratner replied. “My guess is that you would probably have the most support and the best legal team in a bigger country like the UK In a smaller country like Sweden, the US can use its power to pressure the government, so it would be easier to extradite you from there. But we need to consult with a lawyer who specializes in extradition.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Assange’s British lawyer, also at the meeting, proposed that Assange return to Sweden for further questioning.</p>



<p>“I don’t think that’s wise,” Weinglass said, “unless the Swedish government guarantees that Julian will not be extradited to another country because of his publishing work.”</p>



<p>“The problem is that Sweden doesn’t have bail,” Ratner explained. “If they put you in jail in Stockholm and the US pressures the government to extradite you, Sweden might send you immediately to the US and you’d never see the light of day again. It’s far less risky to ask the Swedish prosecutor to question you in London.”</p>

<hr>



<p>The US government’s determination to extradite Assange and imprison him for life, despite the fact that Assange is not a US citizen and WikiLeaks is not a US based publication, Ratner understood from the start, will be unwavering and relentless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 132-page <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USA-v-Assange-judgment-040121.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> (pdf) issued today in London by Judge Vanessa Baraitser of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court the court refused to grant an extradition request only because of the barbarity of the conditions under which Assange would be held while imprisoned in the US.</p>



<p>“Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at [Her Majesty’s Prison] Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr. Assange from finding a way to commit suicide,” said Baraitser, “and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.”</p>



<p>Assange is charged with violating 17 counts of the Espionage Act, along with an attempt to hack into a government computer.&nbsp; Each of the 17 counts carries a potential sentence of 10 years. The additional charge that Assange conspired to hack into a government computer has a maximum sentence of five years. The judge ominously accepted all of the charges leveled by US prosecutors against Assange — that he violated the Espionage Act by releasing classified information and was complicit in assisting his source, Chelsea Manning, in the hacking of a government computer. It is a very, very dangerous ruling for the media. And if, on appeal, and the US has already said it would appeal, the higher court is assured that Assange will be held in humane conditions, it paves the way for his extradition.</p>



<p>The publication of classified documents is not yet a crime in the United States. If Assange is extradited and convicted, it will become one. The extradition of Assange would mean the end of journalistic investigations into the inner workings of power. It would cement into place a terrifying global, corporate tyranny under which borders, nationality and law mean nothing. Once such a legal precedent is set, any publication that publishes classified material, from The New York Times to an alternative website, will be prosecuted and silenced.</p>



<p>Assange has done more than any contemporary journalist or publisher to expose the inner workings of empire and the lies and crimes of the US ruling elite.&nbsp; The deep animus towards Assange, as fierce within the Democratic Party as the Republican Party, and the cowardice of the media and watchdog groups such as PEN to defend him, mean that all he has left are courageous attorneys, such as Ratner, activists, who protested outside the court, and those few voices of conscience willing to become pariahs in his defense. </p>



<p>Ratner’s memoir, which is a profile in courage of the many dissidents, including Assange, he valiantly defended, is also a profile of courage of one of the greatest civil rights attorneys of our era. There are few people I respect more than Michael Ratner, who I accompanied to visit Assange when he was trapped in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. His memoir is not only about his lifelong fight against racial injustice, a rising corporate totalitarianism, and the crimes of empire, but is a sterling example of what it means to live the moral life.</p>



<p>Assange earned the eternal enmity of the Democratic Party establishment by publishing 70,000 hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee and senior Democratic officials. The emails were copied from the accounts of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. The Podesta emails exposed the donation of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation by Saudi Arabia …</p></div></div>

</figure><h3>Decision Taken at Highest Levels of CCP</h3><p>Meanwhile, sources have said the development is a proof of China's resolve to nationalize Alibaba. Song Qing, Internet finance industry insider, said the investigation is part of CCP plans to nationalize both Ant Group and Alibaba. "There will definitely be an outcome, now that they have started the investigation ... This is probably coming from the highest levels," he told Radio Free Asia.</p><p>The suggestions are that the plan to nationalize Alibaba has come from the very top of the ruling Communist Party structure. A few days ago, the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the CCP, said the government's "anti-monopoly work" will lead to "better development." The paper said the party Politburo thought 'anti-monopoly work' should be strengthened to prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.</p><p>Song Qing agrees with the view. "Just a couple of weeks ago, they set out plans to nationalize Ant Group and Alibaba; the timing was deliberate ... Those plans all came from the central leadership," he said.</p>

    Posted on January 11, 2021
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>I have written several posts on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">things that we got wrong in Futhark</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-12-08-why-futhark-sometimes-goes-wrong.html">why the compiler goes wrong</a>, as well as posts about <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html#size-types">complicated features</a> where it is still unclear whether the feature works well enough. However, there are also some parts of Futhark’s design that I feel pretty good about! This post will discuss some of them. I will focus on very concrete details, rather than grand observations such as “bulk-parallel functional programming is a good paradigm for numerical programming”. Such doctrinal statements are more of an entire <em>thesis</em>, and require much richer and more qualified answers than just “this turned out pretty well”. Everything to follow is what I don’t <em>regret</em>, so it is necessarily subjective, but maybe other language designers will find it useful or amusing.</p>
<h2 id="short-names"><a href="#short-names" id="short-names-link" title="short-names">Short names</a></h2>
<p>Naming things is one of the two most difficult problems in computer science, and in contrast to the other two (cache invalidation and off-by-one errors), there is no tooling or theory to tell you when you pick a bad name. Matters are even graver when it comes to names that are part of public interfaces. You may well receive acclaim for fixing a subtle cache invalidation bug in old and widely used code, but do not expect similar praise if you also change the naming convention of the public API from underscores to CamelCasing along the way.</p>
<p>Futhark exposes many names, both in its command line interface and its <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/">built-in libraries</a>. Many of the names have been changed over the years. When we initially fleshed out the primitive type system, I agonised over how to name the new types. Should 32-bit signed integers be <code>Int32</code> as in Haskell, or <code>i32</code> as in Rust? I worried the latter was <em>too short</em>. Yet in the end, that was the scheme we went with: <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code> for the signed types, <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code>/<code>u64</code> for the unsigned, and <code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code> for floats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here is a piece of advice: if you are ever agonising over some design detail that is not core to what makes your language special, and all options seem equally reasonable, just go with whatever Rust does. Odds are that whatever Rust decided was preceded by significant debate, and that whatever they picked has few gotchas. Lexical syntax is one area where this is particularly good (and easy) advice to follow.</p>
<p>But back to naming things. The terse type names turned out to work fine. In fact, I realised that <em>I have never regretted making a name too short</em>. The names I still regret tend to be those that are too imprecise or <em>too long</em> - the <code>negate</code> function in the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> modules should have been <code>neg</code>, for example. I am not quite sure why this is. When I code in Haskell, I have a preference for relatively verbose names for top-level definitions. In Futhark, short names just seem to fit better with the language aesthetics. Maybe that is just the nature of numerical code? I don’t know. But I definitely rely on this observation to guide future naming of things.</p>
<h2 id="file-orientation"><a href="#file-orientation" id="file-orientation-link" title="file-orientation">File orientation</a></h2>
<p>While Futhark is not designed for large programs, we still want to support multi-file programs. Code in a file <code>A</code> must be allowed to reference definitions in some other file <code>B</code>. Languages differ significantly in how they go about this. Futhark went for a particularly simple model: the declaration <code>import "foo"</code> allows access to the definitions in the file <code>foo.fut</code>, looked up relative to the importing file. That is all there is to it. If you know how a hierarchical file system works, then you know how Futhark looks up files. This is not textual inclusion as in C - each file still has to be syntactically valid on its own. We are not barbarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html">The philosophical background is spelled out here</a>, but the basic rationale is that <em>nobody enjoys learning about language import mechanics</em>, and in Futhark we can get away with doing something stupidly simple. Other languages, like Haskell and Java, put more effort into decoupling the notion of a “module” or “compilation unit” from that of a physical file. Even languages that reason in terms of files usually also provide support for a “search path”, where you provide the compiler with additional directories that are searched when including files.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that for larger programs with multiple directories of source files, a file has no unique way to be referenced (except for its absolute pathname, which is not practical), so you may need to use different relative paths in different files (e.g. <code>"../lib/foo"</code> and <code>"../../lib/foo"</code>). Another downside is that you cannot have a central repository of “system files” that are always checked (like <code>/usr/include</code> in Unix).</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> advantage of the design is that each file in a program can be processed as the “root”, without having to look for some kind of project definition file that contains necessary compiler directives such as include paths. This has allowed very lightweight zero-config tooling, such as a “go to definition” command in <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-mode">futhark-mode</a> and showing the types of variables - something that most Emacs modes definitely do not have without additional configuration.</p>
<p>Clearly this solution wouldn’t work for all languages, but it has worked really well for Futhark. I was initially worried because this design is much more similar to <em>bad</em> languages (like shell script) than to <em>good</em> languages (like Haskell), but it hasn’t caused problems yet, and I don’t recall any Futhark programmers ever being confused about how <code>import</code> works. This is the right design for Futhark, and I don’t expect to regret it any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-10-10-block-comments-are-a-bad-idea.html">These remain a bad idea</a>. Emacs has <code>M-x comment-region</code> and inferior editors likely have something similar. No regrets. In fact, my experience writing more <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-08-31-beginning-a-collection-of-futhark-examples.html">semi-syntactic tooling</a> has only strengthened my conviction. Line comments are easy to parse in an ad-hoc way, and it is particularly nice that there is only one way of writing comments.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-binding"><a href="#explicit-binding" id="explicit-binding-link" title="explicit-binding">Explicit binding</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a record type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>type</span> t = {foo: i32, bar: bool}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a function definition we can bind variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to the field contents as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo=a, bar=b}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if we wish to bind variables with the same names as the fields, there is a shorthand syntax inspired by OCaml and Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo, bar}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These languages also support an even more concise form:</p>

<p>This implicitly binds variables with the same names as the record fields. Futhark does <em>not</em> support this. The reason is a philosophy of never bringing names into scope unless those names are actually syntactically present at the binding site in some form. There are many things I enjoy about programming, but guessing where some variable comes from is not among them. I find C++’s policy of implicitly bringing class fields into scope inside method bodies to be particularly confusing.</p>
<p>My distaste for complex binding structure goes further: Futhark requires that all definitions occur <em>before</em> their first use. Originally this was just for implementation simplicity, but I have come to enjoy the restriction. It’s nice not to worry so much about the best definition order, because the compiler already ruled out most options. OCaml and SML have similar restrictions, so this is not <em>just</em> Futhark aping some 70s Pascal dialect.</p>
<p>The one exception to this explicitness principle is the <code>open</code> statement, which brings names from another module into scope. While a plain <code>open</code> is rare, it is used implicitly by <code>import</code>. There are also <em>local open</em> expressions, which allow us to write e.g. <code>M.(x*y+z)</code> with the names in module <code>M</code> in scope within the parenthesised expression. This is <em>really</em> convenient when writing advanced modularised numerical code, as the alternative is the much more clumsy <code>x M.* y M.+ z</code>. I am not sure how to reconcile this with our general principle, but maybe you just can’t be a fundamentalist all the time.</p>
<h2 id="no-dependencies"><a href="#no-dependencies" id="no-dependencies-link" title="no-dependencies">No dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Futhark is written in Haskell, and all of its code dependencies are either pure Haskell libraries or embed small amounts of C code. This means that it is quite easy to build the Futhark compiler - all you need is a standard Haskell build tool like <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code>, which is supported and documented on most operating systems. I do not recall anyone having trouble installing the compiler itself. Difficulties tend to be more in the direction of setting up GPU drivers on Linux (yet another of the great unsolved problems in computer science).</p>
<p>This policy is not all upside. For many years, we lugged around a home-brewed implementation of algebraic simplification because we were averse to native code dependencies. We also generate C code (compiled with the system C compiler) rather than interacting directly with LLVM the way <a href="http://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> does it. This means that there are some things we cannot efficiently express in our generated code. On the other hand, Accelerate’s dependency on LLVM can make it tricky to install, unless your system happens to have the right version of LLVM installed (and HPC systems and servers running <em>mature</em> versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tend not to). <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a> provides compiler binaries that embed a statically linked version of LLVM - this <em>may</em> be a direction we could go in, but I suspect statically linking LLVM with a Haskell program is more tricky than linking it with C++. And frankly, I think I already spend too much time hacking on build systems and CI setups.</p>
<p>We have gone quite far with this focus on installation simplicity. For example, the <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-pkg.html">Futhark package manager</a> does not even use native code to download packages. Instead, it shells out to <code>curl</code>. This has allowed us to statically link the Futhark binary that we provide for releases, a well as not having to worry about certificate store configuration. If you can download with <code>curl</code> in the command line, then <code>futhark pkg</code> will work. And if your system requires you to configure a special proxy or whatnot, then whichever configuration files or environment variables that <code>curl</code> respects will also work for <code>futhark pkg</code>.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant about this …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment.

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides, polymerase, and special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>Enzymes add a cap and a tail to the mRNA to protect it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE). (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with vaccines.) To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message using a Poly(A)Polymerase. New England Biolabs’ online store lists prices for <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0366-mrna-cap2-o-methyltransferase">mRNA Cap</a>, <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m2080-vaccinia-capping-system">VCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0276-ecoli-poly-a-polymerase">Poly(A)Polymerase</a>.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is the main component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moderna has a proprietary molecule called Lipid SM-102. Or maybe it isn’t that proprietary, because it might be covered by a patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Moderna’s <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf">Phase 3 Clinical Study Protocol</a> defines it as “heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate” and calls it a “proprietary ionizable lipid”. In 2018, Moderna researchers published <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdfExtended/S1525-0016(18)30118-7">a Cell paper</a> proposing 10 new lipids, of which SM-102 is number 8, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/1stClef/status/1306653592691113986">this tweet</a>. The paper has a “synthesis” section and supplementary materials which somebody more knowledgeable about such things than I might be able to reproduce. Everyone else will have to purchase it, for example from <a href="https://organixinc.com/lipids/atx001-crrdc-b9dnh-phs3e">Organix Inc at $5,000/100mg</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>PEGylated phospholipids</strong> help stabilize the LNP and protect it from early detection by our immune system. It ensures the LNPs and thus the mRNA can reach its target.
    <ul>
      <li>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0159">ALC-0159</a>.</li>
      <li>Moderna uses DMG-PEG 2000 or “1-monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-dimyristylglycerol” with …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="detecting-anomalies"><a href="#detecting-anomalies">Detecting Anomalies</a></h2>
<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>

<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span>
       <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
       <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span>
           <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>now</span><span>()),</span>

           <span>interval</span> <span>'1 minute'</span> <span>*</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>

<p>The internet has caught fire recently on the news that President Donald Trump has been banned from Twitter and that Google banned the Parler social media app from the Google Play Store. At the time of this writing, Apple has also given Parler a 24 hour warning to increase censorship of its content or face being banned from the Apple App Store. </p>



<p>Hosting an app on a private app store like Apple’s or Google’s has always been touch and go for developers. Most recently, Unreal had a dispute with payment terms with Apple that got them banned from developing on Apple Platforms. However, in that case the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/24/fortnite-ban-unreal-engine-apple-restrained/">ban was temporarily restrained by a judge.</a></p>



<p>However, hosting an app on the open internet using cloud platforms like AWS has historically been much less open to censorship or restriction than a private app store. That has recently changed as <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">AWS has now banned Parler from operating on its cloud infrastructure.</a></p>



<p>Many people might be wondering where does this stop? Is it possible that every app I use or content creator I enjoy might just disappear overnight, never to be seen or heard from again?</p>



<p>The answer is that it depends.</p>



<p>You will never be free to hear or read what you want on closed platforms like Twitter (and yes even Parler), because those platforms exercise centralized control over their content and over the users that post content.</p>



<p>Podcasting is different!</p>



<h2>Podcasts Are Decentralized</h2>



<p>You may have heard the term “decentralized” thrown around a lot recently since Decentralized Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin brought the term to the forefront of the public zeitgeist. When it comes to podcasting, decentralization means that there is no one company or person that controls podcasting or the distribution of podcasts.</p>



<p>A podcast is made up of just two things: A file describing your podcast (description, author’s name, list of episodes, etc) and the audio files for each episode. Those files can be hosted anywhere! You can use one of MANY podcast hosting platforms like BuzzSprout or Fireside.fm, or if you prefer to do it yourself you can put Podcasts in Dropbox, your home server, on AWS, Heroku, GCloud, WordPress… anywhere you can host an audio file you can host a podcast. In fact there is a new end to end hosting solution on the market that allows you to spin up your own podcast hosting server in 5 minutes. It’s called <a href="https://podlibre.org/install-castopod-in-5mn/">Castopod and you can check it out here!</a></p>



<p>At this point you might be thinking about your favorite podcast apps and how they fit into all of this. I’ll address that in a bit, but first let’s dive a little bit deeper into what makes up a podcast.</p>



<h2>What is a Podcast, really?</h2>



<p>The No Agenda podcast currently posts a podcast RSS feed that is an open standard that <strong>any</strong> podcast player can interpret and present to anyone to listen to. The No Agenda podcast is a great example because it’s the podcast hosted by one of the originators of the Podcast standard, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcurry?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">The Podfather – Adam Curry</a>. </p>



<p>Regardless of which podcast player you use they all read the same RSS Feed to present the No Agenda podcast to the listener. Here is the raw RSS feed that represents the NA podcast today: <a href="http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml">http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml</a><br>Here’s a quick break down of the information that all podcast players use to present the podcast to a podcast app.</p>



<p>At the top level of the RSS Feed below, you’ll see the basic podcast description details every podcast has at minimum</p>

&lt;/image&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Inside the &lt;image&gt; tag above you’ll see a url. If you follow that URL you’ll find the cover art for the NA podcast: <br><a href="https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1610054980.284_na-1310-art-feed.png">https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1610054980.284_na-1310-art-feed.png</a></p>



<p>So now we have a podcast title and podcast cover art. As you can see, the details for the podcast we’ve seen so far are clear and available from the open web even directly in your web browser by clicking the links above.</p>



<p>There’s actually a lot of great information that accompanies the podcast in the RSS feed as well. Not all podcast apps make use of this information and not all podcasts actually contain the same information. Podcast RSS Feeds are a sort of controlled chaos. You don’t know exactly what you’re going to get when you open a podcast RSS feed, but you know there are a few items you will get at MINIMUM: podcast title,  list of episodes with audio enclosures and unique Ids.</p>



<p>As long as you have those basic components you can build a podcast app!</p>

<p>Next, if you look inside any of the &lt;item&gt; tags that represent the episodes of the NA Podcast you’ll find a direct link to the audio for that podcast episode. </p>



<pre><code>&lt;enclosure url="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3" length="167771473" type="audio/mpeg"/&gt;</code></pre>



<p>In fact, I can embed the audio for a No Agenda podcast right here into this blog post using that link above, check it out below.</p>



<figure><audio controls="" src="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3"></audio><figcaption>https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty cool!</p>



<p>That’s basically all that any podcast app does. So now that we’ve seen the data that podcast apps consume, let’s talk about what podcast apps actually do.</p>



<h2>Podcast Apps</h2>



<p>Podcast apps take the above RSS information and process it in different ways. The No Agenda Podcast RSS feed in particular has a number of special and optional “tags” that contain information that are processed by apps that support the new Podcasting 2.0 standard <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace">(you can read more about the Podcast 2.0 Namespace here if you’re interested)</a>. This allows podcasts to embed additional information about the podcast like: people involved, chapter jump points, funding URLs and even crypto addresses, but not all podcasts support these new features. For a list of podcast apps and hosting companies that do support these features (and which features are supported) check out: <a href="http://newpodcastapps.com/">newpodcastapps.com</a></p>



<p>Besides processing the RSS Feed information, another important role of a podcast app is to “find” the podcast feeds in the first place. This is where Podcast Databases come into play. There are only a few major podcast databases available currently and they are owned by: Apple, Google and PodcastIndex. These organizations have created what can be thought of as search engines for podcasts (or really podcast RSS feeds) on top of a “master list” of all known podcasts, that are growing every day.</p>



<p>These search APIs are important because your podcast may have an RSS feed sitting on a shared dropbox folder and it might be publicly available and ready for anyone to download it and all of your MP3 episodes… but how would anyone know where it is? They’ll know where it is because you’ll have registered it with one of the major podcast databases we mentioned earlier that podcast apps retrieve data from.</p>



<p>Apple has a special submission process that you can read about here: <a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itce5b9b0782">https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itce5b9b0782</a></p>



<p>If your podcast fails the submission process for any reason, then it will not be included in the database of Apple Podcasts and any podcast apps that use the iTunes Podcast search API will not be able to find your podcast. </p>



<p>But wait… that doesn’t sound very censorship proof!? What if Apple won’t approve my podcast because they don’t like what I have to say about the latest iPhone model? If Apple controls what podcasts I can add to my podcast app then don’t they have the power to censor any podcast?</p>



<p>Well, not quite. There are a couple of protections built in to the podcast ecosystem that make podcast censorship impossible to enforce.</p>



<p>The most exciting development in recent years towards podcast freedom is <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">PodcastIndex.org</a>. Podcast Index is a free podcast database developed by Adam Curry and Dave Jones with a stated goal to: “Preserve podcasting as a platform for free speech”. As long as the Podcast Index is available there will always be a place for free speech podcasts on the internet. By the way, Podcast Index is entirely user supported, so you can help to ensure that Podcast Index is available well into the future <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">by donating here!</a></p>



<p>PodcastIndex.org is a great free speech alternative to podcast platforms like Google and Apple. However, not all podcast apps use the PodcastIndex as their search API. A podcast app is only as good as its search database. So if Apple or Google decide to exclude your podcast from their search results then users won’t be be able to search for your podcast on any apps that rely on the Google or Apple podcast search Database / API.</p>



<p>The Podcast Index also regularly <a href="https://archive.org/details/podcastindex_dump">publishes their list of podcasts RSS feeds to the Internet Archive</a> for safe keeping an open access. This means that anyone that wants to can start a new podcast index to compete with Apple’s or Google’s doesn’t have to start from square one. </p>



<h2>Adding an RSS Feed</h2>



<p>There is an additional layer of censorship protection built into most podcast apps. In fact, this feature is so fundamental that I’d say that if an app doesn’t have this feature then it’s not actually a podcast app.</p>

<p>That podcast RSS Feed we looked at earlier (or any for that matter) can be directly imported to the HyperCatcher podcast app as well as the Apple Podcast app and many other podcast apps (but not all… looking at you Spotify).</p>



<p>As long as this feature exists then no matter where a podcast is hosted or who hosts it, you can import it to your favorite podcast app and get notified when new episodes are available.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In a world where information and communication channels seem to be disappearing right in front of our eyes you can rest assured that your favorite podcasts will survive the internet purge …</p></div></div>

<p>Back in 2016 I did a project where I released something of value every week for 12 weeks. I called it <a href="https://www.joeldare.com/wiki/the_passive_income_experiment">The Passive Income Experiment</a>. It wasn’t financially successful, but I created a couple products that I still use regularly. I also launched 10 things that were terrible ideas.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I took the Future Founders School offered free by YC. One of the things they say to do is launch over and over again. I’m not sure which project to work on, so I’ll be taking this advice and launching <em>something</em> every week in 2021.</p>

<p>Until I heard this advice, I was really thinking about a launch as a single event in history. I’m fairly sure it’s one of the reasons none of my ideas really stick and a reason I feel like I don’t stick with an idea for very long.</p>

<p>I already have a few applications and some small books that I could launch again, so I’m going to use those for the quick and dirty launches I’ll use to meet my goals this time and I’ll create a few new projects along the way too.</p>

<p>Maybe something will stick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So far I’ve only launched on Hacker News, because it’s probably my favorite platform at the moment, but the rules ask you not to use it primarily for promotion, so I’m planning to spread my releases around and try lots of different platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my list of launches for 2021 so far.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://ponder.joeldare.com/">Ponder</a> on Show HN - January 8th</li>
  <li><a href="https://calories.joeldare.com/">Calories</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25729026">Show HN</a> - January 11th</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’d like to follow my progress on this project and others, <a href="mailto:list@joeldare.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&amp;body=Please%20subscribe%20me%20to%20your%20email%20list.">send me an email</a> and I’ll add you to my email list.</p>

is enough to make the test pass, then you continue writing more tests according
to your requirements at hand. By having tests in place, any change you do on
your main code (let’s call it production code from now) can be checked against
those tests and running them for every new change can be a way to get faster
feedback, as an alternative to boot your application (whatever that is), run by
each scenario and check if things are working as expected.</p>

<h2>My journey</h2>
<p>TDD (Test-Driven Development) is one of many techniques for developing software
and this article aims to share my personal experience with it. I hope that I can
clarify my thoughts on <strong>when I believe it can help</strong> and when I believe we
should take a step back. I need to say that <strong>I found TDD pretty difficult and
abstract at first</strong>. There will always be a space for discussion and that’s why
other processes such as pair-programming and code review are extremely
complementary to what I consider healthy software development processes. Let me
give you some context before I start, so then you can understand better where I
came from.</p>
<p>I’ve started reading about TDD on the internet and what helped me the most in my
first steps were the articles from the <a href="https://www.caelum.com.br/">Caelum</a>
website. I found really nice examples of how to do it at the time through their
articles and further I found <a href="https://alabeduarte.com/">books</a> which led me to
the formal definitions written by Kent Beck. Then I joined
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> in 2011 and there I believe it was
a turning point for me. ThoughtWorks is famous for its revolutionary mindset
(look for <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">the agile manifesto</a>), the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Tech
Radar</a> publications and for caring about
code quality. However, the reason I believe working there was so important was
because of the people that I had a chance to work with at the time. They really
encouraged me to challenge the current state of the code and how it could be
improved. We also had a strong pair-programming culture which combined with
writing tests, challenging code maintainability became pretty natural.</p>
<h2>Why do I believe TDD is important?</h2>
<h3>Test-Driven Development enables refactoring.</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, having tests that exercise your code’s intention (function
or method) opens room for refactoring the code with stronger confidence. You can
move stuff around, you can rename things that express better what you are trying
to do, you can add an argument to a function or you can remove them all. If
after all of that you run your tests and they pass, chances are that you’ve done
everything right! The opposite is true as well. If you change things and after
running the tests some of them fail, it could be a sign that you’ve done
something wrong and needs to be fixed. While refactoring the code, if you notice
that one single change affects multiple tests, it could be a sign that the
coupling between components is high or the scope of the change/refactor is big.</p>
<p>With time, <strong>I learned that TDD is not about testing first necessarily</strong>. The
process of writing tests first, seeing them fail to then make them pass to be
able to refactor really helps but the key factor to me was let the tests drive
how I think so that my scope of changes can be expressed in the tests. I might
want to refactor something, but if my scenarios are pretty small, I can postpone
this decision for later.</p>
<h3>Test-Driven Development favours design</h3>
<p>TDD is all about letting your tests guide you about the problem you need to
solve. It is pretty common to use the baby steps terminology here. Basically,
you will start with really small and basic scenarios (for a given input, I
expect this output). With that in mind, your code design should be simple enough
to satisfy the requirements. Another aspect that can contribute to better design
is that your test is the first consumer of your code. There you will call the
function that you carefully named and thoroughly added certain arguments and you
will see if that really expresses what you want to do. You may ask: “Should I
really pass 4 arguments in here?” “Is this name good?” “Isn’t too complicated to
set up the initial state for just testing if this does what it needs to do?” If
the answer to this question doesn’t feel quite right, you can use this
opportunity to change your code and look at your unit tests again and imagine:
“how will someone call this code in real life? Is it easy to read?”.</p>
<p>Sometimes, “For a given input, I expect this output” is not possible.  You could
argue that it is not that simple as sometimes it is not easy to structure input
and expected output. However, The fact that might not be possible all times
doesn’t change the fact that you can always think about it and make it as an
exercise. Challenge yourself often and see if this is really the case. If not,
try breaking down your code into smaller components and then ask this question
again.</p>
<h3>Good code design is pretty subjective!</h3>
<p>YES! That is it! If I’m coding all by myself I’m pretty sure I’ll understand it
all and every decision will make sense until I have to explain to someone.
That’s how pair programming and/or code review becomes crucial here. The process
of doing TDD evolves empathy as well. I tend to think that we need to solve some
problems right away, but often when I share my thoughts with someone I realise
that I’m thinking too far ahead. Conversations like that can help you to avoid
overengineering and make decisions prematurely. As we know by now, our tests are
the first consumers of our code, so lean on that and discuss with your peers
whether this is really a good design. Here are some questions that I often try
to ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li> Is my code easy to maintain?</li>
<li> Is my code easy to change?</li>
<li> Is my code easy to read?</li>
<li> Is my code expressive enough?</li>
</ul>
<h3>TDD doesn’t mean bug-free code!</h3>
<p>I’ve heard an argument before saying that if you’re doing TDD, your code
shouldn’t have bugs. Well, I believe this is a bold statement. Of course, my
code can have bugs. Test-Driven Development is a technique that requires
discipline and experience. If I don’t follow the steps, for example, if I never
see my tests failing, I can fall into the false positive trap. It is crucial to
write a test, see it fail, then make it pass! The tests should also be reliable.
Is part of the good design I mentioned above that our tests are also easy to
read and maintain. They should be predictable and clean. If there are too many
dependencies or setups, it could be a sign that my code is too coupled,
therefore, it will be hard to maintain and false positives can be introduced.
Besides, at this stage, you could argue if having tests is really adding value
given the amount of setup that it might require if you come to that point.</p>
<p>There is another aspect to it, which is: we still can write tons of unit tests
following all the rules, but with the wrong assumptions. If we don’t understand
the problem we are trying to solve, we will end up having tests that will
exercise something that doesn’t make sense with tests passing.</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>In the previous sections, I’ve described techniques, beliefs and discipline. To
make it stick and be pleasant, we need to have good tooling. The tests should be
fast to run. It should be quicker to run a test than open the application (i.e.
browser or mobile device) myself and test it out. While coding, it should be
quick to trigger the tests as well. Nowadays, most programming languages’
ecosystems contain some tool where it watches your code and whenever you save a
file, the tests relevant to that file will run. That is the sweet spot, in my
opinion.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts and when doing TDD doesn’t help</h3>
<p>I believe that Test-Driven Development doesn’t help when we are not quite
certain about what to do and what to expect. Sometimes, you might not be
familiar with the language, framework or platform and you might need some time
to play around with the available APIs and see what it is possible and what can
be a constraint.</p>
<p>As the expected outcome might be unknown, having the development guided by tests
can be extremely difficult since TDD is all about defining the expectations and
figuring out how to meet them. So what usually works well for me is to do quick
experiments, writing code with no tests at all, see what can be done, explore
the limits of the tool/platform/API and then restart with TDD mindset using the
experiments as a reference/documentation. After that, I can safely throw the
experiment away and continue with the new code.</p>
<p>Of course, this might not work for everyone, but as I mentioned a few times, it
is all about the exercise. If you try to do that, you might learn a thing or two
and next time you will perform better. All I want is the short feedback and the
ability to iterate over my understanding of the problem at hand often.</p>

<p>
  Social networks are usually run by single central organizations.
  When you visit <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, for example, your computer talks to servers located in giant datacenters owned by a company called “Facebook, Inc.”.
  In addition to running all the servers and networking equipment, Facebook, Inc. also does things like control who’s allowed to use the website, pick trending topics, and tweak the algorithm that decides what shows up in your feed.
</p>
<p>
  Lately, though, there’s been some interest in <em>decentralized social networks</em>.
  These systems let lots of different people and groups run parts of the service.
  (Often, they’re set up so that anyone can join in just by running a special program on their computer.)
  I’ve been seeing projects like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>,  and <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a> get released and slowly gain in popularity over the past few years. If you want to stretch the definition of “social network”, there’s also <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>, and <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These kinds of projects are exciting to me because they could solve a lot of the problems with social networks.
  It’s a lot harder for decentralized networks to go down, or make user-hostile changes, or submit to pressure from authoritarian regimes.
  They’re also kind of cool from a technical perspective.
  Despite all this, I haven’t found a project that I personally want to use or recommend to people yet—every decentralized social network I’ve looked at is missing something or other.
</p>
<p>
  I think I’ve managed to boil down the things I want to see in a decentralized network into three key features:
</p>
<h2>Network-layer anonymity (like <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> or <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">Tor Onion Services</a>)</h2>
<p>
  When your computer talks to a website, that website receives your IP address.
  There’s a very good technical reason for this: if you ask the website to send you some information, the website needs to know where to send it.
  (A bit like a return address on a letter.)
  But IP addresses can also reveal information about you.
  They usually indicate roughly where you live and who your Internet Service Provider is, and they can be used to connect multiple online accounts/posts/views back to the same person.
  Hackers can also use your IP address to send things like DDOS attacks your way.
  On centralized networks, though, this isn’t the biggest problem in the world—Facebook already has lots of information about you, and they probably aren’t going to DDOS their own users.
</p>
<p>
  But in some decentralized social networks, <em>random other users of the network</em> get your IP address and can link it to your activity.
  They can build websites like <a href="https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/">iknowwhatyoudownload.com</a>, which lets you look up anyone’s BitTorrent activity if you know their IP address.
  These random people aren’t even bound by the flimsy privacy policies and PR considerations that Facebook is—they can do whatever they want with the information.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, there are techniques that decentralized networks can use to avoid this.
  I’m not an expert on the subject, but systems like I2P or Tor seem to work by sending data through multiple other nodes in the network before it reaches its final destination.
  You can use encryption to make sure none of the intermediate nodes can see the data, and you can make sure that the destination only knows who the last intermediate node is and not who the original sender is.
</p><p>
  This doesn’t mean that the actual posts or users of the service have to be anonymous—you can definitely implement things like user profiles.
  It just means not leaking users’ IP addresses.
</p>
<h2>Grassroots content delivery (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Hosting data on the Internet isn’t free.
  You have to buy hard drives, and you have to pay for electricity and Internet access.
  Usually, whoever owns the website pays to host it; I spend a few dollars each month from my salary, and Facebook spends tens of millions of dollars that they get from <strike>secret backroom deals with the Illuminati</strike> advertising.
  But the whole point of decentralization is that no single person or company owns the website!
  So who pays for it?
</p>
<p>
  Some decentralized networks try to solve this problem with cryptocurrency schemes, but this means that anyone who wants to try out the network has to put their credit card information into a sketchy website and transfer money to a sketchy offshore bank account and do other sketchy cryptocurrency stuff.
  (Also, cryptocurrencies are usually outright scams.)
  Other decentralized networks have “instances” which one person pays for and a bunch of other people can use.
  But instances have a single point of failure: if the person who runs the instance decides to shut it down, all of the accounts and posts and stuff on that instance are gone forever.
</p>
<p>
  The solution I like the best is to let anyone host anything they want.
  If Bob really likes my posts and want to help keep them online, he can set up his own little server and copy all my posts to it.
  Then, when someone wants to view my posts, their computer will search for anyone who has them and ask for a copy.
  Could be me, could be Bob, could be the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.
  Their computer downloads the posts and uses cryptographic hashes/signatures to make sure no one tampered with them.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of “grassroots” system has some huge advantages.
  Posts that are more popular will get hosted more; if lots of people want to see something, there’ll be lots of network bandwidth available to show it to them.
  And all it takes is one person who cares to keep something alive on the network, even if the person who originally created it isn’t around anymore.
</p>
<h2>Customizable moderation (like <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists">uBlock Origin</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Social networks need some kind of moderation to make sure your feed isn’t filled with spam, or viruses, or other harmful content.
  Companies like Facebook handle this in two ways: by developing machine-learning algorithms to try and automatically detect bad stuff, and by hiring huge teams of human moderators to try and detect it manually.
  But both machine-learning algorithms and people make mistakes sometimes.
  And even if they don’t, they’re still a single point of failure—if Facebook, Inc. goes out of business, or doesn’t speak your language, or decides it’s not worth allowing memes that upset the Chinese government, you’re kind of outta luck.
</p>
<p>
  It might be tempting to try and solve these issues by going in the complete opposite direction: no moderation whatsoever.
  But then you’re stuck with the original problem of your feed being filled with harmful content!
  If a totally unmoderated platform isn’t overrun with spam yet, that just means it isn’t popular enough for spammers to notice it.
</p>
<p>
  Ad blockers are faced with a similar problem, and they’ve found a very good middle-ground solution.
  If you open uBlock Origin’s settings page, there’s a “Filter lists” tab where you can choose which people’s rules to use.
  (Each rule is the name of one specific website or advertisement to block.)
  There are some filter lists that almost everyone uses, like <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList and EasyPrivacy</a>, and there are some that are more niche or regional, like <a href="https://github.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists">Frellwit’s Swedish Filter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/olegwukr/polish-privacy-filters" lang="pl">Oficjalne polskie filtry przeciwko alertom o Adblocku</a>.
  You can also write your own rules, both to block things that EasyList missed and to <em>un</em>-block things that EasyList blocked by mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Content moderation on a social network could work in a very similar way, with different groups of moderators creating different lists of banned users and deleted posts.
  You could have lists almost everyone uses that block things like spam, and you could also have lists for more controversial stuff like adult content and criticism of the Chinese government.
  And sort of like how “shared blocklists” work on Twitter, smaller groups could create their own lists of users and posts to ban.
</p>
<p>
  But if someone really needed to see a post that had been deleted by a moderator—like if they were worried it contained their personal information or threats against them—they could manually override that block.
  (They’d be able to see it, but it wouldn’t affect anyone else.)
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Put together, I think these three features would be really powerful for a decentralized social network.
  If you know of a project that offers all three of these, or you’re working on one, please let me know by emailing <a href="mailto:carter.sande@duodecima.technology">carter<wbr>.sande@<wbr>duodecima<wbr>.technology</a>.
  I’d be really excited to hear about it and try it out for myself!
  And hopefully, lots of other people would be too.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>July 29, 2016</p></header><p>Technology allows companies to collect more data and with more detail about their users than ever before. Sometimes that data is sold to third parties, other times it’s used to improve products and services.</p><p>In order to protect users’ privacy, anonymization techniques can be used to strip away any piece of personally identifiable data and let analysts access only what’s strictly necessary. As the Netflix competition in 2007 has shown though, that can <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf">go awry</a>. The richness of data allows to identify users through a sometimes surprising combination of variables like the dates on which an individual watched certain movies. A simple join between an anonymized datasets and one of many publicly available, non-anonymized ones, can re-identify anonymized data.</p><p>Aggregated data is not much safer either under some circumstances! For example, say we have two summary statistics: one is the number of users, including Frank, that watch one movie per day and the other is the number of users, without Frank, that watch one movie per day. Then, by comparing the counts, we could tell if Frank watches one movie per day.</p><h3 id="differential-privacy-to-the-rescue"><a href="#differential-privacy-to-the-rescue" aria-label="differential privacy to the rescue permalink"></a>Differential Privacy to the rescue</h3><p>Differential privacy formalizes the idea that a query should not reveal whether any one person is present in a dataset, much less what their data are. Imagine two otherwise identical datasets, one with your information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a query will produce a given result is nearly the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second dataset. The idea is that if an individual’s data doesn’t significantly affect the outcome of a query, then he might be OK in giving his information up as it is unlikely that the information would be tied back to him. The result of the query can damage an individual regardless of his presence in a dataset though. For example, if an analysis on a medical dataset finds a correlation between lung cancer and smoking, then the health insurance cost for a particular smoker might increase regardless of his presence in the study.</p><p>More formally, differential privacy requires that the probability of a query producing any given output changes by at most a multiplicative factor when a record (e.g. an individual) is added or removed from the input. The largest multiplicative factor quantifies the amount of privacy difference. This sounds harder than it actually is and the next sections will iterate on the concept with various examples, but first we need to define a few terms.</p><p><strong><em>Dataset</em></strong></p><p>We will think of a dataset <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">d</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as being a collection of records from an universe <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>Learning new juggling moves is a task that benefits from breaking down into smaller, more achievable goals. In this respect it is very similar to learning a new coding language or framework.</p>



<p>Take my favorite 3 ball juggling move, for example: the Box.</p>



<figure><img src="https://libraryofjuggling.com/JugglingGifs/3balltricks/box.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>In order to learn this we need to work out what is going on. There are three separate throws, two going up (one in each hand) and one going across.</p>



<p>Steps to learn the box:</p>



<p>1. One ball, up, across, up again</p>



<p>2. The hard part on both sides, with two balls (simultaneous up and side throw, not very intuitive but once you have it, it feels great)</p>



<figure><img src="https://libraryofjuggling.com/JugglingGifs/3balltricks/boxfourthstep.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>3. Go for it. if you spent enough time on step 2, you can do it!</p>



<figure><img src="https://libraryofjuggling.com/JugglingGifs/3balltricks/boxsecondstep.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>By the way, the example above is from <a href="https://libraryofjuggling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://libraryofjuggling.com/</a></p>



<p>Similarly in programming we have to break tasks down into pieces, only putting them together at the end. Recently I got a new job building an online app using Flask, JavaScript and a little bit of JQuery, Jinja and something called “Tabulator” for web tables (and Bootstrap for buttons).</p>



<h2>Learning</h2>



<p>Previously I had only worked in Android (Java) and Arduino (C++), so at least the syntax made sense on the front end, but in order to get the basics down I started by going through the <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeCodeCamp</a> examples. Once I knew how to call a function, parse an array, set up a library and so on it was time to move on to the next step – building a basic program which works. </p>



<p>Finally I gained enough understanding of the inner workings that I was able to add/remove features without being afraid of breaking things and could start to enjoy building something.</p>



<h2>Deploying</h2>



<p>In Juggling, I learned that being able to keep up the pattern without dropping is only part of the process. As soon as I wanted to show off my new moves I was faced with another set of problems to solve. After some more practice, I learned that every juggling routine needs a flashy start and finish (to get people’s attention). It’s also important to  be able to juggle without looking at the pattern, while talking at the same time.</p>



<p>In the software world this is called deployment. Personally I like going with my own Ubuntu based server (hosted by <a href="https://m.do.co/c/fb7f46fdcd1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Ocean</a> ) but there are many options out there, each with their own different requirements to learn.

  <p>According to theoretical calculations of computer scientists, algorithms cannot contain a harmful artificial intelligence</p>
  

  

  <p>We are fascinated by machines that can control cars, compose symphonies, or defeat people at chess, Go, or Jeopardy! While more progress is being made all the time in Artificial Intelligence (AI), some scientists and philosophers warn of the dangers of an uncontrollable superintelligent AI. Using theoretical calculations, an international team of researchers, including scientists from the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, shows that it would not be possible to control a superintelligent AI. </p>

<p>Suppose someone were to program an AI system with intelligence superior to that of humans, so it could learn independently. Connected to the Internet, the AI may have access to all the data of humanity. It could replace all existing programs and take control all machines online worldwide. Would this produce a utopia or a dystopia? Would the AI cure cancer, bring about world peace, and prevent a climate disaster? Or would it destroy humanity and take over the Earth?</p>
<p>Computer scientists and philosophers have asked themselves whether we would even be able to control a superintelligent AI at all, to ensure it would not pose a threat to humanity. An international team of computer scientists used theoretical calculations to show that it would be fundamentally impossible to control a super-intelligent AI </p>
<p>“A super-intelligent machine that controls the world sounds like science fiction. But there are already machines that perform certain important tasks independently without programmers fully understanding how they learned it. The question therefore arises whether this could at some point become uncontrollable and dangerous for humanity”, says study co-author Manuel Cebrian, Leader of the Digital Mobilization Group at the Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development</p>
<p>Scientists have explored two different ideas for how a superintelligent AI could be controlled. On one hand, the capabilities of superintelligent AI could be specifically limited, for example, by walling it off from the Internet and all other technical devices so it could have no contact with the outside world – yet this would render the superintelligent AI significantly less powerful, less able to answer humanities quests. Lacking that option, the AI could be motivated from the outset to pursue only goals that are in the best interests of humanity, for example by programming ethical principles into it. However, the researchers also show that these and other contemporary and historical ideas for controlling super-intelligent AI have their limits.</p>
<p>In their study, the team conceived a theoretical containment algorithm that ensures a superintelligent AI cannot harm people under any circumstances, by simulating the behavior of the AI first and halting it if considered harmful. But careful analysis shows that in our current paradigm of computing, such algorithm cannot be built.</p>
<p>“If you break the problem down to basic rules from theoretical computer science, it turns out that an algorithm that would command an AI not to destroy the world could inadvertently halt its own operations. If this happened, you would not know whether the containment algorithm is still analyzing the threat, or whether it has stopped to contain the harmful AI. In effect, this makes the containment algorithm unusable”, says Iyad Rahwan, Director of the Center for Humans and Machines.</p>
<p>Based on these calculations the containment problem is incomputable, i.e. no single algorithm can find a solution for determining whether an AI would produce harm to the world. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrate that we may not even know when superintelligent machines have arrived, because deciding whether a machine exhibits intelligence superior to humans is in the same realm as the containment problem.</p>
<p>The study “Superintelligence cannot be contained: Lessons from Computability Theory“ was published in the <i>Journal of Artificial Intelligence</i> <i>Research</i>. Other researchers on the study include Andres Abeliuk from the University of Southern California, Manuel Alfonseca from the Autonomous University of Madrid, Antonio Fernandez Anta from the IMDEA Networks Institute and Lorenzo Coviello. </p>

<p>Avid bitcoiner Peter McCormack released <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/questions-for-tether">a podcast interview</a> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/wbd-297-tether">archive</a>) with two Tether/Bitfinex frontmen today—CTO Paolo Ardoino and General Counsel Stuart Hoegner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McCormack is a well-known Tether apologist whose podcasts are funded almost exclusively by bitcoin companies. Tether is also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-s-general-counsel-doubles-down-on-support-for-peter-mccormack">paying his legal fees</a> in a libel suit brought against him by Craig Wright. Despite that, McCormack claims to be completely objective, although he makes it clear he believes all the “Tether FUD” circulating on Twitter stems mainly from “salty nocoiners,” who are upset because everyone is getting hilariously rich with bitcoin but we’re not. </p>



<p>I’ve transcribed the interview and added my comments. I skip the first few minutes of the interview where McCormack lists his numerous crypto sponsors and goes on to say he thinks Tether is legit.&nbsp;I’ve also edited out the “uhs,” and some repeated words to make reading easier.</p>



<p>Here you go:</p>



<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Can you just explain to me and for other people who are listening, because they probably don’t really fully understand it, how tethers are issued and redeemed?</p>



<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Let’s be clear on our terminology, if we’re going to talk about issuances and redemptions. We use four principal terms when we talk about this: authorized tethers, issued tethers, redeemed tethers, and destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorized tethers are tokens that are created on a blockchain, and they’re available for issuance to the public. This process involves multiple blockchains and multiple persons participating to sign creation transactions. Once created, they’re available for sale to third parties, but until then, they sit in Tether’s treasury as authorized but not issued.</p>



<p>These authorized-but-unissued tokens aren’t counted—or [are] not counted—in the market cap of tethers as they have not been issued or released into the ecosystem. You should think of them a little bit like an inventory of products that are sitting on the shelf that are awaiting purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issued tethers are authorized tokens in actual circulation, and they have been sold to customers by Tether and are fully backed by Tether and the reserves, unless, and until they’re redeemed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As tokens are issued, the stock of authorized-but-not-issued tethers, is depleted. And they’re replenished through authorization of new tokens based on market demand. When that happens, this is what Paolo is referring to in his PSA on the replenishment of the tether inventory. This is adding to the authorized and unbacked and ready for sale, but not issued, sold and backed tethers.</p>



<p><em>(I love how Hoegner makes it clear that authorized tethers in the hundreds of millions, like this one <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1347896030185009154"><span>here</span></a>, which we see going out via <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert"><span>@whale_alert</span></a>, are not actually backed. They’re just tethers on the shelf. Tether has issued $24 billion in tethers to date—and nearly 20 billion of them since March 2020.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Okay. Why do you need to do that? Because I would have thought the creation of tethers is a very simple and easy job. Why do you need to leave them on the shelf?</p>



<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> It’s a straightforward job, but it’s an important job. And it’s one that comes with security risks, and Paolo can speak to this a little bit. But there are security risks involved in using sensitive private keys to create new tethers, authorized. And to have those at the ready, and not in the marketplace, not backed. That exposes those keys to less risk. That’s not just a theoretical risk—there’s a serious security risk associated with that. Paolo, do you want to speak about that?</p>



<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Yeah, I believe that we can think [of] Tether authorization, private keys as among the most important sets of private keys in our industry. If you get hold of the private keys, you can really issue any amount of tethers you want. What we want to do is to limit the number of times per week when these private keys get accessed by signers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, having an unsigned [ro? roll?] transaction that gets prepared&nbsp;with a fixed amount and then signed when they need to, that really helps tether security. Because then you can see that we are issuing round numbers, like $200 million, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that we pre-prepared a [ro?] transaction that is an authorization transaction. Then tether signers, sign that transaction and broadcast it. And as Stu said, we are leaving a bit of inventory on the shelf in order to fulfill what we think that future requests from customers could be.</p>



<p><em>(The inventory does fly off the shelf pretty quickly. You can literally watch in realtime tethers shooting off to crypto exchanges Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex, and lots of unknown wallets, where they are quickly put to work.)</em></p>



<p>In our day-to-day activity, we are always in talks with customers. So, we [have] a good sense of what they might need, or they ping us in advance and they say, okay, we might need a certain [of] this amount or we might need that amount of tethers. In time, we learned how much tethers we should authorize in advance and keep it on the shelf in order to make these tethers available as soon as they are needed. But at the same time also protecting the security of tether, not continuing to touch the private keys every single time there is just one insurance.</p>



<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Okay, I’m going to just push back on you saying they’re the most important private keys in the industry. I would say, personally, my private key is the most important one. Outside of that, I would probably say wherever the biggest honeypot is, maybe it’s Satoshi, his private keys, are the most important because Bitcoin is completely censorship resistant—but Tether isn’t, right? You can, if required, censor transactions. You can, if somebody issued a bunch of fake tethers, you could block those, I believe.</p>



<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> First of all, I agree that bitcoin private keys are, well, everyone’s private keys are like their own babies. No doubt about that. The difference as you said is that if someone gets ahold of the private keys in tether, they can issue anything that they want. While in Bitcoin, if someone gets hold of the private keys, they can just steal the funds of the people that got hacked, rather than minting fake bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is really important, and this is the reason why we want to keep these private keys so secure and touch them as little as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, yes, we can freeze, fake tethers. But at the same time, you can imagine if someone gets ahold of the…in order to freeze tethers, someone has to have the private keys. But if someone already has the private keys, then he can unfreeze our attempt to freeze tethers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we will become an endless attempt of freezing and unfreezing and trying to save tether. That is not ideal. The responsible thing to do is touch the private keys as little as possible and use, of course, for our blockchain, we use a multisig approach. So there are multiple private keys held by different signers in geographical different [locations] so that we can ensure the highest security possible in all our operations.</p>



<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Stuart, I interrupted you, you were going to talk about redemptions. We should finish that bit off.</p>



<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure. So redemptions are just when customers send their tokens back to tether and they get fiat back and return. Those tokens then go back into inventory, like their products that have been returned to inventory, awaiting future purchases. And then those tokens can be held by tether and its treasury or destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then destruction is just, multisig transactions being broadcast to reduce the number of outstanding tokens existing on the selected blockchain. And those tokens are forever eliminated. Basically, that’s the reverse of authorization. So those four concepts you have the lifecycle of the tether.</p>



<p><em>(The only time we’ve seen Tethers destroyed was in October 2018 <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-just-burned-500-million-usdt-stablecoin-tokens"><span>when Tether burned 500 million USDT.</span></a> This was just after Bitfinex lost access to $850 million in the hands of its Panamanian payment processor Crypto Capital, and the NYAG began investigating Tether/Bitfinex for fraud. Hoegner confirms our suspicions that once tethers are created, they are generally never uncreated.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Peter:</strong> So, Paolo, who is using tethers. What are they using it for and what is the KYC process for people who want to use tether? And actually I’ll throw another one in there: who can’t [use tether]? Who applies and who do you turn down?</p>



<p><strong>Paolo:</strong> Let’s start with who uses Tether. I think Stuart can speak better about the KYC/AML process,</p>



<p>Tether was born in 2014. It started from the Omni Layer. And the reason why it was born is because there was an issue among crypto trading exchanges. In 2013, Bitcoin reached, for the first time, $1,000, but across different exchanges, you [could] see that the spread was $200 to $300. And the reason was pretty simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin moves with the pace that is every 10 minutes because that is the average block time, while dollars and fiat in general move much slower. So you send a wire and you can take one day, five days, and that was not allowing proper arbitrage across platforms. And that is really important for healthy markets. You don’t want to have OKCoin to be $1,000 and Bitfinex to be [$1,300] and so on. That is the job of arbiters. They step in and try to close these gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with just fiat, it&nbsp;was really difficult in 2014. It is slightly a bit better now, but you want both legs of a trading pair, like BTC/USD, to move at the same speed, at the same pace. And the only way to do that was to use the same underlying technology. So, the Omni Layer was and is using Bitcoin transactions to move tethers on-chain. That was the perfect use case. And so tether was born for that specific reason—to solve a problem</p>



<p>Recently, of course, we started to look into different use cases because I believe that is the time that tether should outgrow the crypto market. That is still our main market, but we are looking to work with [inaudible] businesses that offer remittances, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

  <p><time datetime="2021-01-11T00:00:00+0200">Mon, Jan 11, 2021</time></p><p>Hello there, long time no see!</p>
<p>As you may know, I’m currently working at <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>, as part of the backend team working on <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>’s server-side implementations. The main project involved in this work, at least from my side of things, is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>, the reference Matrix homeserver implementation. If you don’t know what a homeserver is, you may want to check out my post <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">Enter the Matrix</a>, in which I give an extensive introduction to Matrix. Parts of this blog post need a basic comprehension of how Matrix works, so if you don’t already have that, you’ll probably want to give that post an eye before continuing this one.</p>
<p>In this context, in 2019, I got to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5815">implement</a> in Synapse a feature that had been actively requested by the Matrix community for a while now: message retention policy support. It allows any server or room admin to define a period of time after which a message gets hidden from clients and eventually deleted.</p>
<p>This feature is fairly complex to implement and document, due to different moving parts needing to interact with one another. The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/message_retention_policies.md">current documentation</a> is a good place to start, especially if you’re mainly interested in knowing how to configure a retention policy on your server or in your room. But I thought it might be interesting to get a bit deeper into its implementation and explain some design choices and shortcomings.</p>
<p>In other words, the goal of this post isn’t to explain how to get set up with this feature, but to be a technical breakdown explaining the internal design of this implementation. For instance, I’m not going to dump and explain the necessary bits of configuration right away but rather try to explain is as much detail as I can what they do. If you’re a complete stranger to this feature you might want to have a very quick skim through the documentation I’ve linked to in the previous paragraph, though I’m going to repeat a bunch of what’s being said there.</p>
<p>So here I go.</p>

<p>Message retention policies are defined in Matrix in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1763/proposals/1763-configurable-retention-periods.md">MSC1763</a> (an MSC being a proposal to the Matrix specification, not unlike RFCs), which defines them as state events (of type <code>m.room.retention</code>) sent to the room the administrator (or moderator) wants to regulate. Therefore, a policy is scoped to a room.</p>
<p>The content for this state event looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
    <span>"max_lifetime"</span><span>:</span> <span>2419200000</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"min_lifetime"</span><span>:</span> <span>86400000</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This event has two properties: <code>max_lifetime</code> and <code>min_lifetime</code>. Their values are time durations expressed in milliseconds. The combination of these properties define the lifetime of an non-state event after it’s been sent to a room:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>max_lifetime</code> defines how long after the message is sent the homeservers participating in the room can keep it around. In the example above (where its value is <code>2419200000</code>), it means a homeserver <strong>must</strong> delete events sent to the room at the latest 28 days after they’ve been sent (though we’ll see later that, in the current implementation in Synapse, it can vary a bit around that value).</li>
<li><code>min_lifetime</code> defines the minimum amount of time after the event is sent during which homeservers should store the event and not delete it. This is particularly helpful for e.g. governmental organisations that are required (through laws like the Freedom Of Information Act) to keep a record of messages sent, or for moderation purposes. In the example above (where its value is <code>86400000</code>), it means a homeserver <strong>should</strong> store events at least 24h after they’ve been sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, these parameters are limits to the total lifetime of an event. If a message retention policy has no <code>min_lifetime</code> then the homeserver is free to delete events as soon as it wants, and if it’s got no <code>max_lifetime</code> then the homeserver is free to never delete any event. It’s then up to the homeserver to decide when to delete events using these constraints.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at how this is implemented in Synapse. Before going any further on the implementation side of things, I need to mention that this implementation is still currently considered experimental, and is disabled by default in any new install. We’ll see a bit later in this post how to enable and tweak it using Synapse’s configuration file. Currently, the MSC still needs some clarification and discussion, and so future iterations on it might cause the implementation to change. This is why we’re not declaring it stable as is and enabling it by default yet. On top of that, its main goal is to perform bulk deletion of data, so we want to make extra sure it’s done right before flicking the switch in order to prevent any irreversible breakage.</p>
<p>First, let’s see how Synapse keeps track of retention policies for all the rooms it’s in. That bit is rather simple: every time a state event is sent to a room with the type <code>m.room.retention</code>, Synapse will <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/70259d8c8c0be71d3588a16211ccb42af87235da/synapse/storage/databases/main/events.py#L1270-L1301">insert</a> a row into its <code>room_retention</code> database table. This row will include some data about the policy, including the <code>min_lifetime</code> and <code>max_lifetime</code> properties. Note that both those properties are <code>NULL</code>able, allowing for either (or both) property to be omitted (we’ll see later what Synapse does in this case). As far as Synapse is concerned, a room with a retention policy with an empty content (<code>{}</code>) is the same thing as a room with no retention policy.</p>
<p>Now that Synapse knows the retention policy for each room it’s in, it can apply it to the events in the room. It’s worth noting that a current point of discussion on the MSC, and somewhere the implementation differs from the spec, is that the MSC mentions events should be purged according to the retention policy of the room as it was when the event was sent. Synapse, on the other hand, will purge events based on the retention policy the room currently has, because it creates less technical complications, provides better performances and seems to better fit the expectations of users.</p>

<p>Let’s take a quick break from the technical breakdown to clarify a thing or two. In the next few sections, I’ll take a look at different parts of Synapse’s implementation of message retention policy support. I’ll also explain how they tie into the feature’s configuration.</p>
<p>Message retention policy support can be enabled and tweaked in Synapse’s YAML <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/70259d8c8c0be71d3588a16211ccb42af87235da/docs/sample_config.yaml">configuration file</a>. All of the configuration related to this feature can be found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/70259d8c8c0be71d3588a16211ccb42af87235da/docs/sample_config.yaml#L369-L436">in the <code>retention</code> section</a>. I’m not going to get into too much detail about what the different sub-sections and settings mean and how they’re used, as the rest of this post already covers this. One thing I will mention here, however, is that you can enable the feature by setting <code>enable</code> to <code>true</code> in this section.</p>
<p>Note that if this setting is missing or set to <code>false</code>, Synapse will still store new message retention policies. It will not, however, delete any event from the database.</p>
<p>Now let’s see how Synapse deletes messages when this feature is enabled.</p>

<p>Because it would be too expensive and complex to track the lifetime of each event individually, and set a timer to purge them from the database, Synapse purges events by running regularly scheduled jobs. Doing so also allows merging code paths with another feature, which is the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/admin_api/purge_history_api.rst">purge history admin API</a>. The frequency and scope of these jobs are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/70259d8c8c0be71d3588a16211ccb42af87235da/docs/sample_config.yaml#L402-L436">defined in Synapse’s configuration</a> as such:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>purge_jobs</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>longest_max_lifetime</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3d</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>interval</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>12h</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>shortest_max_lifetime</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3d</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>interval</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1d</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This example describes two purge jobs. This definition includes a frequency, defined by the required <code>interval</code> setting, which defines the time between two instantiations of a job.</p>
<p>In the example above, Synapse will run a job every 12 hours purging expired events in rooms which retention policy feature a <code>max_lifetime</code> with a value of 3 days or less; as well as another job every day purging expired events in rooms which retention policy feature a <code>max_lifetime</code> with a value of more than 3 days (note that <code>longest_max_lifetime</code> is inclusive but <code>shortest_max_lifetime</code> isn’t).</p>
<p>The reason Synapse allows multiple jobs to be defined in the same configuration is that all rooms don’t have the same sensitivity with regards to their retention policy. Some might have their policy dictate that no event can live longer than a day, whereas others might only require events to be purged after a year.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that running a purge job might be an expensive task to run as it can involve deleting a lot of data, so you don’t want to run a job every minute purging all expired events in all rooms.</p>
<p>Defining multiple jobs allows making sure rooms get processed according to the sensitivity of their policy, as well as ensuring the best performance possible. You could see it as sharding (or partitioning) the load of purging history of rooms across all of the jobs based on a room’s retention policy. This also allows sufficient flexibility in the configuration.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that both <code>shortest_max_lifetime</code> and <code>longest_max_lifetime</code> are optional here; and here as well lack of one limit simply means there’s no limit applied in that direction. For instance, the following example defines a purge job without any limit on the interval of <code>max_lifetime</code> values it handles:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>purge_jobs</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>interval</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>12h</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>It is also possible to bind a job to a precise scope by specifying both settings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>purge_jobs</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>interval</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>12h</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>shortest_max_lifetime</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6h</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>longest_max_lifetime</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1d</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Heads up that it’s highly recommended to configure a job with an open limit on each side of the range of <code>max_lifetime</code> values - this can be either a job with no limit (as shown above) or two jobs, each limiting in one direction.</p>
<p>But wait, you’ll then say, isn’t it bad if Synapse might delete expired messages hours, possibly days, after they’ve expired? To which I’d answer that yes, probably, however this is mitigated by another feature of this implementation: when a message expires, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/70259d8c8c0be71d3588a16211ccb42af87235da/synapse/visibility.py#L136-L143">Synapse will stop sending it to clients</a>. This means that, even though Synapse might not purge events immediately when they expire, it will prevent clients from seeing it. Note that clients that have already …</p></div></div></div>

		<p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8aa8abb85e9dd7349855c46620a7a3604ff150ac/f15b4/assets/images/bughunt/cover.jpg" alt="Woman on computer"></span></p><p><span>There are bugs in your life.</span></p>

<p>I don’t mean actual bugs, except maybe if you’re an entomologist. I mean bugs of the sort that computer programmers deal with in their jobs.</p>

<p><span>A bug is something that isn’t working as intended.</span></p>

<p>Bugs can be minor, as when a button that’s supposed to be green is red instead. However, bugs can also have massive consequences. They can be so nasty that they crash the websites of multi-million dollar companies and make them lose a ton of money, or they can make a car veer just enough to the right that it crashes against the side of a road.</p>

<p>We are not computers, nor are we made up of code, so our bugs are of a different sort, but they share some commonalities.</p>

<p>Just as computer bugs are pieces of a program that can be improved upon, there are aspects in our lives that could be working better than they currently are.</p>

<p>God knows none of us are perfect. I know I’m not. <span>We all have bugs in our source code.</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the costs these bugs have in our lives are rarely as self-evident as the crashing of a website or a car accident. They operate out of sight, only making their presence felt not in what we do, but in what we fail to do, in the goals we do not accomplish.</p>

<p>Suppose you’ve always wanted to write a book, perhaps a sprawling fantasy epic.</p>

<p>Sadly, you’ve never been able to instill in your life the routines and habits that would get you to put words down to paper. It’s never the right moment, you tell yourself. There’s too much work on your plate and you’re too undisciplined about it. You have all these excuses; all these obstacles that prevent you from writing your book, and so your dream is still just that: a dream.</p>

<p>Maybe you have an idea for a piece of software you think would make a great business opportunity, but even though you are certain that this is something you want to pursue, you nevertheless spend your free time doing anything but writing the lines of code that will turn that dream into a life-changing reality.</p>

<p>In both of these examples, you have bugs that prevent you from achieving your goals, and these bugs work in insidious ways.</p>

<p>You rarely see their effects on your life. You just unsee the future they cut you away from.</p>

<p>You don’t see the book you don’t write or the business you don’t start. These costs do not announce themselves to you, you don’t see them right before your eyes. They are the paths your life could have taken but instead have now become walled off to you without you ever noticing they were there in the first place.</p>

<p>What you see is all there is, and because you don’t see these blocked-off paths, it’s like they never existed.</p>

<p><span>The bugs in your life hold you back. </span></p>

<p>If your life was an engine, bugs would be the muck clogging up its cylinders. Bugs are the strength of the river’s current, and you’re swimming upstream.</p>

<p>It would be great if you could fix your bugs, but to fix them you must first discover what bugs you have in the first place</p>

<p>There’s where the bug hunt comes in.</p>

<p><span>On a bug hunt, you have one job: to catalog every bug in your life that you can find.</span></p>

<p>Pick up a piece of paper and write down every aspect of your life that could be improved upon, regardless of whether that part of your life is going well or not. <strong>If it can be made better, then it’s a bug.</strong> Add anything that comes to mind to your catalog of bugs.</p>

<p>Block out the next ten minutes or so with nothing to distract you, and write down every bug that pops up in your mind.</p>

<p>Do not censor yourself. No one will see this. The things you think are a bug may turn out to not be one on further inspection, but that triage is for another time. Do not block your mind. Let it flow freely and focus on capturing what it tells you.</p>

<p><span>The purpose of a bug hunt is to surface what you might know beneath the surface but have never made explicit.</span> There is power in making explicit what was once implicit, it makes things graspable. It makes them real.</p>

<p>Do not come up with bug fixes. That is also for another time. <strong>The time for bug squashing comes later.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re having trouble coming up with bugs, ask yourself what you could do better, or what you should stop doing. Imagine a day in your life where everything goes right. What does that day look like? How does that mythical perfect day differ from the ones you’ve been leading?</p>

<p>Other questions you can use as prompts to surface more bugs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What would the closest people in your life say you could be doing better?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What is something that causes you pain, both physically and emotionally?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Is there something, anything, you’ve always wanted to be able to do but still can’t?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What is stopping you from making your life better?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Are you as good as you want to be? And if not, what can you do to get there?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>What would a more ambitious version of yourself be like?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a student, ask yourself whether there is something lacking in your current studying habits. Do you spend too much time passively reading the textbook? Are you avoiding doing practice problems because it’s too much work and you’re afraid of finding out you don’t know how to solve them? Are you making use of spaced repetition to retain the things you learn? If so, how often do you miss your daily reviews?</p>

<p>If you’re a professional, are you keeping up with the latest advances in your field, or are you skating by with the inertia of what you already know? Are you practicing and refining your skills, just as musicians and athletes practice and refine theirs? Could the velocity of your career increase, or have you grown complacent where you are?</p>

<p>Be honest with yourself about what you could be doing better.</p>

<p>We all have things we can improve on, and these improvements compound as you add more of them to your tally. Each incremental improvement you make in your life might not seem like much at first, but together they can be a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p><span>Each bug you fix is one less bug holding you back. It’s less muck slowing your engine down. It’s a mellower current for you to swim against.</span></p>

<p>You can go on a bug hunt as many times as you want. There’s nothing stopping you from doing so.</p>

<p>One effective way to incorporate bug hunts into your life might be to make it a staple of your weekly or monthly review. If you don’t currently block out time where you plan out how the coming week will look like or what your goals for the coming month are, those might be bugs you want to fix.</p>

<p>You can even use the results of your bug hunt to inform what you’re going to work on during the next week or month. If on one of your hunts you realize, for example, that you spend way too much time distracted when you should be focusing on getting work done, then you might make it a goal for the week to put the systems in place that will help you sustain your attention and focus.</p>

<p>Did you think just now how unlikely it is you’ll actually make a habit of going on bug hunts on a regular basis? Then that might also be a bug - assuming you actually want to go through with them. Acknowledge that this might be a problem and think about how to skip past it. You can schedule it: make it a weekly or monthly recurring event in your calendar.</p>

<p>The value of a bug hunt is that it makes you notice the cracks in your life. It puts them front and center in your mind. You can choose not to fix them, that’s up to you. But at least you know they exist. You cannot escape from them once you’ve written them down.</p>

<p>I went on a bug hunt of my own before I began writing these words. It only makes sense, I thought. I picked up a piece of paper I had laying around and wrote a list of the bugs that first came to mind:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f899c05e0b1122240d854ae296275f936268a795/689e6/assets/images/bughunt/personal_bugs.jpg" alt="Ten examples of bugs I found in my own bug hunt"></p>

<p>My handwriting is atrocious, I know.</p>

<p>The first line reads, <em>“Default to playing Noita at night”</em>. Noita is this independent videogame where every pixel in the game world is physically simulated, and it’s like catnip to me. I love it.</p>

<p>The problem is, as soon as the sun sets, it becomes increasingly harder for me not to default to playing Noita instead of doing something more in line with what my goals are.</p>

<p>I could be reading a book, but instead, I’m playing a game. Now that I’ve made it explicit that this is something I need to work on. I can’t run away from this realization.</p>

<p>And if I do end up running away from it, then next week, when I go on another one of these bug hunts, I will have to write that down as a bug. That’s the power of the bug hunt.</p>

<p>By externalizing the things you could be working on improving, you make them inescapable.</p>

<p><span>Bug hunts are about finding where the leaks in your life are.</span> If you can find the holes through which you have water leaking from, you can work to plug them.</p>

<p><span>Plug enough of these leaks and you’ll stop sinking and start sailing smoothly into where you want to be.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><blockquote><p>“Don’t expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won’t be. Don’t count on motivation. Count on Discipline.”
― <em>Jocko Willink</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s two types of discipline: external and internal. I strongly believe that you change your life when you learn to harness internal discipline.</p><h2>External Discipline</h2><p>Self-help books are wonderful at giving us external discipline. The reinforcing words of the author telling us “we can be great”. That feeling in your chest that this time it’s going to be different. It’s all a short term fix.</p><p>When we read self-help books what we’re really looking for is a cheat method for obtaining internal discipline. However, in doing so we fail to actually grasp how internal discipline is formed.</p><p>I’ve sat in rooms with people who regularly read self-help books. They have read more books than I ever had and yet if you were to talk to them about their goals/dreams you’d soon find out they haven’t made any real significant progress towards them at all.</p><p>To further my point, I’ll give you an example from my childhood. My father is a brawny, 6ft 4, 242lb man from Turkey with a temper. Like his father, he was very strict, so therefore it made perfect sense for him to pass that strictness down to me. </p><p>What my father wanted was for me to be disciplined like he was as a young man. Pushing those ideals onto me only gave me external discipline which made me rely on him shouting at me to give me the drive to do those things (the same reason why people hire personal trainers at the gym during January time). After a few weeks of work I gave up. I had no internal discipline to push me to want to be better.</p><h2>Internal Discipline</h2><blockquote><p>Decision, a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration. - Oxford Dictionary</p></blockquote><p>There comes a point in our lives when we decide to be truly better. We may have had enough of not being confident in ourselves or that we felt that our life was slipping away and we had not done enough in the time we had already spent. In other words, we want to be better.</p><p>However, the “want” has to become a “need”. That need has to be so great that you’ll do anything to achieve it. Without having a need you’ll always rely on the external discipline.</p><p>I can’t tell you exactly how to get this need (that would make me a self-help guru). But what I can say is that you should sit yourself down and have a real look at your life. Look at your books, look at your dreams, goals, and who you have around you. Then ask yourself  “am I working towards who I want to become?”.</p><p>My “need” was when I decided that I hated how I looked and started taking my nutrition seriously. The need to look great made eating sweet potatoes and lean turkey breast enjoyable because I knew every meal, every squat, every curl made me one step close to being shredded. After one year of eating 1,800kcal, walking 2 hours a day, working out 5x a week. I ended up becoming 70kg, 10% body fat, and 1000x more confident in life.</p><p>Another “need” of mine came about when I sat down and looked at my life. I worked so hard to get to such a point in my career and yet I felt not complete. The need to be a founder lead me to launching readercatch.com and starting the 12 in 12 challenge.</p><p>Finally, I do recommend that you use external discipline to top-up your internal discipline when you’re feeling down or overwhelmed. However, you must not rely solely on external discipline. Think of it like your headphones dying mid-workout. You relied on them and now you don’t have the discipline to finish your workout.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<p>Do you feel your database is growing too big or too old? Hard to maintain? Well, I hope I might be able to help you a bit with that. The text you’re about to read is a real life experience of scaling a monolith database to be able to support a top 250-website (according to <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a>). At the moment of writing this article, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a> ranked <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a> at 215th place in the world. We’ve got over 4M unique daily users and over 7B queries hitting all our MySQL databases combined. Went from under 1M unique users a day a year ago to 1.3M in March, to over 4M at the moment, with over 8M games played each day. I know it’s no where near the biggest players on the market, but our experience could help you “fix” your monolith database, and scale it to new heights.</p>



<p>Disclosure: <em>This is my first ever article, and it’s too long as it is – but I had to cut probably as much text as you see here in order to make it actually readable. So, some things might be confusing or not well explained, and I’m sorry for that. Hit me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and we can get into a deeper discussion.</em></p>



<p>Update: after reading a lot of comments, I’d like to add/clarify a few things. We do use caching, extensively. If we didn’t we wouldn’t survive a day. We do use Redis, often pushing it to its extremes. We’ve tested MongoDB and Vitess, but they didn’t do it for us. </p>



<h2>The state in which we were just couple of years ago</h2>



<p>Somewhere mid-2019 we’ve started noticing that our main DB cluster is slowly growing a bit too big. We had three smaller and less used databases on the side, but everything was always added to the main one. Surprisingly, it was in a fairly decent state for a database that started its life over 12 years ago. Not many unused/redundant indexes, the ones that were there were mostly good. We constantly monitored and improved heavy/slow queries. A nice chunk of data was denormalized, as well. No foreign keys, many things were done in the code itself (filtering, sorting, etc, to make sure the DB only ever uses the most efficient indexes) running on the latest version of MySQL, etc, etc. It wasn’t neglected and it evolved over time into something that did a good job for us. </p>



<p>Disclaimer: I’m not recommending anyone to do these sorts of micro-optimizations. They are working for chess.com, on its scale. We benchmark almost anything we’ve never done before, and see how it turns out, before actually implementing it. We know these work <strong>for us</strong>.</p>



<div>
<p>The biggest problem we were facing at that point in time was that altering almost any table required taking half the hosts out of rotation, run the alter there, put it back in rotation, alter the other half, put them back in. We had to do it off-peak, as taking half the hosts out during the peak time would probably result in the other half crashing. As the website was growing, old features got new improvements, so we had to run alters a lot (if you’re in the business, you know how it goes). Altering would’ve been far less stressful if we could could pull just a small set of tables out of rotation, instead of the entire DB. So, we created a 5 year plan for our main cluster (and boy, were we wrong about our timeline), in which we were to split the database into many smaller ones, and that would make things easier to maintain (we were right about this, at least). The plan assumed ~25% yearly growth, which was what we were seeing in previous years.</p>

<h2>The REAL problem appears and our plan implodes</h2>



<p>You’re all familiar with COVID-19, and how all of that went. Guess what – we weren’t really ready (or we didn’t expect it to have the impact it had on or traffic). Interest in chess exploded when (most of) Europe went into a lockdown. Fun fact – we could tell which country went into a lockdown just by looking at our registrations by country – it was so clear. And numbers skyrocketed across the board. Funnily enough, all our databases were doing fine (not great, but they handled the traffic). But at the same time we noticed that our “reports” host was constantly struggling to keep up with the production hosts (i.e., it was often 30-60 seconds behind on replication), which prompted us to analyse our replication stream and its remaining capacity. And it was close to being full, at peak traffic reaching over 95% of the capacity. At that point we knew that USA (where most of our players are from) would also go into a lock down, soon, and that would mean that our replicas wouldn’t be able to keep up with all the writes going to the master (or even if we just keep growing slowly). This would mean the end of <a href="http://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a>, as the code isn’t ready to handle big replication delays when reading data from replicas, and sending all the selects to master would take it down. That made our goal clear: decrease number of writes going to the main cluster, and do it as quickly as possible! This was actually part of our aforementioned plan, but that plan stretched over 5 years. Now we had just one or two months to do that. </p>



<h2>The solution</h2>



<p>How to decrease number of writes to a single DB? Sounds simple – identify tables that are written the most and rip them away from the DB. That way the number of writes handled remains the same, but they are just split into two separate streams. These can be either tables that get a lot of inserts, or not as many inserts, but with records that are frequently updated. Store them elsewhere. How to do it with no downtime? As you’d imagine – not really that simple. </p>



<p>We first identified all the tables that had most updates (inserts, deletes or updates). Most of them were nicely grouped together based on the feature for which they were used (most of game related tables would be written at a similar pace, etc), and we managed to gather a list of 10-15 tables, for 3 different website features. As soon as we started investigating them, another problem was revealed – since we can’t “join” between databases on different hosts, we would need to move as many tables as the feature used to make the project simpler (we were already aware of this, since when “the plan” first came into place, we did something similar for 3 smaller, less used tables as a PoC, and it turned out fine). </p>



<p>The 3 features we identified as high-traffic were logs (not really a feature, and not really logs, they were just poorly named), games (like you’d expect on a chess gaming platform) and puzzles. For logs we’ve found just 3 very isolated tables, which meant not a lot query/code changes were required. Similar for games, as well. But puzzles had over 15 tables to move, and the queries on those tables had lots of joins towards tables that were to remain in the main database cluster. We’ve rallied our troops, pulled over half of our backend developers, split them into teams, and started pushing on all of these in parallel. </p>



<p>It took just one week to move logs into its dedicated database, running on two hosts, which gave us some breathing space, as those had the most writes, by far. One more month to move games (which was oh so scary, as any mistake there would be a disaster, considering that’s the whole point of the website), and puzzles took over 2 months. After these, we were well under 80% of the replication capacity in the peak, which meant we had time to regroup, and plan upcoming projects a bit better.</p>



<h2>The execution</h2>



<p>So, how did we do it? </p>



<p>As you might assume, there are two sides to a project like this – code and database, and both require a lot of work. On the code side, there are a few prerequisites for a project like this one. First of all, we need some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature flag</a> (aka feature toggle) system, either internal or 3rd party. Ours is custom built, pretty extensive, and maybe a topic for another post. The bare minimum the feature flag system needs to provide is to allow or deny access to a percent of checks from 0 to 100 percent. Another really useful thing to have is a good test coverage. Our entire codebase was rewritten from scratch a few years ago, so we were lucky enough to have that, as it saved us a couple of times.</p>



<div>
<p>Between code changes and database changes, some things can be done in parallel and some require going by numbers. The easiest thing to start with is to set up the new database. All our new databases pulled from the main one (we call them partitions, and this process partitioning) end up on a 2-host setup (master and failover-master (replica)), but it can really be anything we want. On the partition cluster, we create a new database with identical schema to the one we’re trying to split (just name it according our needs, in this case the first one was named<code> logs</code>). Then a backup of the main database is imported, after which we hook up the master of the partition cluster to be a replica of the main master (this is why we need the identical schema and backup import). This way the new cluster becomes just like any main cluster replica, only with a differently named database. Then it just sits there, looking pretty, replicating traffic, and being up-to-date with the rest of the cluster while we work on the code side of this project.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Before we started working on this project, we essentially had 2 connections open to the database from the code: read only connection hitting replicas and read/write connection pointing to the master. Both actually hitting HAProxy, to get where they need to go. First thing we did is to create a parallel set of connections, where read/write connection goes to the <code>Partition Master</code> and read-only connection to the <code>Partition Replica</code>.</p>



<p><em>Chess.com is written in PHP, so I’ll use PHP examples to illustrate the needed changes, but I’ll keep it pseudo enough so that anyone can understand what’s going on (you’d be surprised how many websites in the top 1k are written in PHP, and how easy it is to scale PHP to those heights. Maybe a topic for another post.). </em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

<p>There’s a lot of discussion about technical skills candidates need to have, like algorithms, systems design, technical communication. But I actually think the <em>interviewer</em> is the one with the greater responsibility.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. A candidate needs to demonstrate they are capable of the job they are being hired for. That means they need to have the technical skills they will use on the job and, in an ideal world, that should be enough. But the interviewer’s job is to assess if the candidate can succeed on the job, which is not an assessment that happens regularly with their coworkers. The interviewer has to perform this assessment for a variety of candidates with different skill sets and backgrounds.</p>

<h2 id="familiarity-with-different-technologies">Familiarity with different technologies</h2>

<p>Candidates come from diverse backgrounds. If you hire a capable engineer, you will train them on your particular tech stack, but that will take time. In the hour or so you have to evaluate an experienced engineer, the most valuable data point you can consider is how they perform using the tools they are familiar with. After all, that’s the way they’ll work on your team in the long term.</p>

<p>So, it’s up to you, as the interviewer, to accommodate different backgrounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An obvious one is <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/07/27/let-the-candidate-choose-their-programming-language.html">programming language</a>.</strong> Two weeks into the job, the candidate will have re-familiarized themselves enough with Java to be productive. But for the last few years, they’ve been working in Python, and they’ll be best able to show the command of Object Oriented patterns and problem solving using Python. Your job is to have enough familiarity with common programming languages to understand the code they’re writing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Familiarize yourself with different tools in the same space.</strong> Your company uses Kafka, but the candidate is more familiar with RabbitMQ. If you understand the landscape of message queues, you can better evaluate if the candidate knows how a message queue fits into a bigger system. The more you know about RabbitMQ, the better you can assess if they understand the trade-offs of RabbitMQ, and therefore how well they’ll understand why your company chose Kafka. Finally, by understanding the technologies on the candidate’s resume, you’ll know what their area of expertise is, even if you’ve never personally used those technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, <strong>recognize different approaches to the same problem</strong>. Different businesses make different trade-offs. Interview problems often have different solutions. Just because the candidate approaches a problem differently than you doesn’t disqualify them. What matters is they can justify their choices, and that you can intelligently understand those justifications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Only by having a strong grasp of different technologies can you engage candidates on their own areas of expertise. That is, after all, where you’ll get the most useful signals about their technical ability.</p>

<h2 id="quick-comprehension">Quick comprehension</h2>

<p>Think about how you review code. You have to comprehend the code, verify it solves the problem it claims to solve and find any issues with the implementation that automated tooling wasn’t able to find. Evaluating a candidate’s code during an interview is like reviewing code, but faster paced. And that makes sense: if the candidate is writing code under pressure, you have to review code under pressure.</p>

<p>The consequence of this is you, as an interviewer, have to be really good at reviewing code. You, of course, need to know the candidate solved the problem correctly, even if they used an approach or coding style you didn’t anticipate. If they didn’t solve the problem correctly, you have to find the error quickly so you can <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/03/16/were-in-it-together.html">help them get back on track</a>, or simply to note how close they got to the solution. This is especially important if <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/11/16/getting-the-candidate-to-the-finish-line.html">the clock is running out</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I still believe an experienced candidate should not have to prepare for an interview, because the goal of the interview is to see how they would perform on the job, not how they perform in the interview itself. To make this possible, it’s crucially important for interviewers to step up their game and be exceptional at conducting interviews. And that means being exceptional technically.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, a candidate has one set of strengths. But you have to know enough to recognize all the combinations of strengths different candidates bring to the table.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I vacillate between two modes: sometimes I think every scientific and professional field is genuinely complex, requiring years if not decades of specialization to truly understand even a small sliver of it, and the experts<span><a href="#fn5071682221" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682221">1</sup></a></span> at the apex of these fields have deep insights about their subject matter. The evidence in favor of this view seems pretty good, a quick look at the technology, health, and wealth around us ought to convince anyone.</p><p>But sometimes one of these masters at the top of the mountain will say something so obviously incorrect, something even an amateur can see is false, that the only possible explanation is that they understand very little about their field. Sometimes vaguely smart generalists with some basic stats knowledge objectively outperform these experts. And if the masters at the top of the mountain aren't real, then that undermines the entire hierarchy of expertise.</p><p>Some hierarchies are undeniably legitimate. Chess, for example, has the top players constantly battling each other, new players trying to break in (and sometimes succeeding), and it's all tracked by a transparent rating algorithm that is constantly updated. Even at the far right tails of these rankings, there are significant and undeniable skill gaps. There is simply no way Magnus Carlsen is secretly bad at chess.</p><p>Science would seem like another such hierarchy. The people at the top have passed through a long series of tests designed to evaluate their skills and knowledge, winnow out the undeserving, and provide specialized training: undergrad, PhD, tenure track position, with an armada of publications and citations along the way.</p><p>Anyone who has survived the torments of tertiary education will have had the experience of getting a broad look at a field in a 101 class, then drilling deeper into specific subfields in more advanced classes, and then into yet more specific sub-subfields in yet more advanced classes, until eventually you're stuck at home on a Saturday night reading an article in an obscure Belgian journal titled "Iron Content in Antwerp Horseshoes, 1791-1794: Trade and Equestrian Culture Under the Habsburgs", and the list of references carries the threatening implication of an entire literature on the equestrian metallurgy of the Low Countries, with academics split into factions justifying or expostulating the irreconcilable implications of rival theories. And then you realize that there's an equally obscure literature about every single subfield-of-a-subfield-of-a-subfield. You realize that you will never be a polymath and that simply catching up with the state of the art in one tiny corner of knowledge is a daunting proposition. The idea of exiting this ridiculous sham we call life flashes in your mind, but you dismiss it and heroically persist in your quest to understand those horseshoes instead.</p><p>It is absurd to think that after such lengthy studies and deep specialization the experts could be secret frauds. As absurd as the idea that Magnus Carlsen secretly can't play Chess. Right?</p><p>Imagine if tomorrow it was revealed that Magnus Carlsen actually doesn't know how to play chess. You can't then just turn to the #2 and go "oh well, Carsen was fake but at least we have Fabiano Caruana, he's the real deal"—if Carlsen is fake that also implicates every player who has played against him, every tournament organizer, and so on. The entire hierarchy comes into question. Even worse, imagine if it was revealed that Carlsen was a fake, but he still continued to be ranked #1 afterwards. So when I observe extreme credential-competence disparities in science or government bureaucracies, I begin to suspect the entire system.<span><a href="#fn5071682222" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682222">2</sup></a></span> Let's take a look at some examples.</p><h4 id="59"><a href="#59" title="59"></a>59</h4><p>In 2015, Viechtbauer et al. published <em>A simple formula for the calculation of sample size in pilot studies</em>, in which they describe a simple method for calculating the required N for an x% chance of detecting a certain effect based on the proportion of participants who exhibit the effect. In the paper, they give an <em>example</em> of such a calculation, writing that if 5% of participants exhibit a problem, the study needs N=59 for a 95% probability of detecting the problem. The actual required N will, of course, vary depending on the prevalence of the effect being studied.</p><p>If you look at the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0%2C5&amp;cites=8563214002358604992&amp;scipsc=1&amp;q=59&amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">papers citing Viechtbauer et al.</a>, you will find dozens of them simply using N=59, regardless of the problem they're studying, and explaining that they're using that sample size because of the Viechtbauer paper! The authors of these studies are professors at real universities, working in disciplines based almost entirely on statistical analyses. The papers passed through editors and peer reviewers. In <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">my piece on the replication crisis</a>, I wrote that I find it difficult to believe that social scientists don't know what they're doing when they publish weak studies; one of the most common responses from scientists was "no, they genuinely don't understand elementary statistics". It still seems absurd (just count the years from undergrad to PhD, how do you fail to pick this stuff up just by osmosis?) but it also appears to be true. How does this happen? Can you imagine a physicist who doesn't understand basic calculus? And if this is the level of competence among tenured professors, what is going on among the people below them in the hierarchy of expertise?</p><h4 id="Masks"><a href="#Masks" title="Masks"></a>Masks</h4><p>Epidemiologists have beclowned themselves in all sorts of ways over the last year, but this is one of my favorites. Michelle Odden, professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford (to be fair she does focus on cardiovascular rather than infectious disease, but then perhaps she shouldn't appeal to her credentials):</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/experts_masks-097c3b01fdd318edec9f70415bc95d6b.jpg"></p><h4 id="Time-Diversification"><a href="#Time-Diversification" title="Time Diversification"></a>Time Diversification</h4><p>CalPERS is the largest pension fund in the United States, managing about $400 billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qFIcakrlowE?t=4743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a video of a meeting of the CalPERS investment committee, in which you will hear Chief Investment Officer Yu Meng say two incredible things:</p><ol><li>That he can pick active managers who will generate alpha, and this decreases portfolio risk.</li><li>That infrequent model-based valuation of investments makes them <em>less risky</em> compared to those traded on a market, due to "time diversification".</li></ol><p>This is utter nonsense, of course. When someone questions him, he retorts with "I might have to go back to school to get another PhD". The appeal to credentials is typical when fake expertise is questioned. Can you imagine Magnus Carlsen appealing to a piece of paper saying he has a PhD in chessology to explain why he's good?<span><a href="#fn5071682223" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682223">3</sup></a></span></p><h4 id="Feedback-Loops"><a href="#Feedback-Loops" title="Feedback Loops"></a>Feedback Loops</h4><p>It all comes down to feedback loops. The optimal environment for developing and recognizing expertise is one which allows for clear predictions and provides timely, objective feedback along with a system that promotes the use of that feedback for future improvement. Capitalism and evolution work so well because of their merciless feedback mechanisms.<span><a href="#fn5071682224" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682224">4</sup></a></span></p><p>The basic sciences have a great environment for such feedback loops: if physics was fake, CPUs wouldn't work, rockets wouldn't go to the moon, and so on. But if social priming is fake, well...? There are other factors at play, too, some of them rather nebulous: there's more to science than just running experiments and publishing stuff. Mertonian, distributed, informal community norms play a significant role in aligning prestige with real expertise, and these broader social mechanisms are the keystone that holds everything together. But such things are hard to measure and impossible to engineer. And can such an honor system persist indefinitely or will it eventually be subverted by bad actors?<span><a href="#fn5071682225" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682225">5</sup></a></span></p><p>What does feedback look like in the social sciences? The norms don't seem to be operating very well. There's a small probability that your work will be replicated at some point, but really the main feedback mechanism is "impact" (in other words, citations). Since <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t">citations in the social sciences are not related to truth</a>, this is useless at best. Can you imagine if fake crank theories in physics got as many citations as the papers from CERN? Notorious fraud Brian Wansink racked up 2500 citations in 2020, two years after he was forced to resign. There's your social science feedback loop!</p><p>The feedback loops of the academy are also predicated on the current credentialed insiders <em>actually being experts</em>. But if the N=59 crew are making such ridiculous errors in their <em>own</em> papers, they obviously don't have the ability to judge <em>other</em> people's papers either, and neither do the editors and reviewers who allow such things to be published—for the feedback loop to work properly you need both the cultural norms and genuinely competent individuals to apply them.</p><p>The candidate gene literature (of which <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-HTTLPR</a> was a subset) is an example of feedback and successful course correction: many years and thousands of papers were wasted on something that ended up being completely untrue, and while a few of these papers still trickle in, these days the approach has been essentially abandoned and replaced by genome-wide association studies. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Alexander is rather sanguine</a> about the ability of scientific feedback mechanisms to eventually reach a true consensus, but I'm more skeptical. In psychology, the methodological deficiencies of today are the more or less same ones as those of the <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the 1950s</a>, with no hope for change.</p><p>Sometimes we can't wait a decade or two for the feedback to work, the current pandemic being a good example. Being right about masks <em>eventually</em> isn't good enough. The loop there needs to be tight, feedback immediate. Blindly relying on the predictions of this or that model from this or that university is absurd. You need systems with built-in, automatic mechanisms for feedback and course correction, subsidized markets being the very best one. Tom Liptay (a superforecaster) has been <a href="https://www.maby.app/covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoring his predictions against those of experts</a>; naturally he's winning. And that's just one person, imagine hundreds of them combined, with a monetary incentive on top.</p><h4 id="Uniformity"><a href="#Uniformity" title="Uniformity"></a>Uniformity</h4><p>There's a …</p></div></div>

Do you want to talk about how you got into Babbage and his work with Lovelace and so on?</span></p><p id="t=00:01:09" data-timecode="00:01:09"><a href="#t=00:01:09"><span>00:01:09</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Yes. I think I probably knew about it at university because it was mentioned just like, "Oh, by the way, there was this other thing, and maybe it was a computer, Charles Babbage. Then what really happened was, right at a time when I was at university in the UK, the Science Museum in London started building one of Babbage's machines, this thing called the difference engine, which is really a very big specialized calculator. It is not a computer and they started actually taking his plans and building it. Because of where I live when I was at college, and where my parents were, I used to have to travel through London.</span></p><p>I would literally go through London and sneak out of the tube, go into the Science Museum, look at this thing being built, and then slowly, it would get bigger and bigger and bigger, because they built it in public.</p><p id="t=00:01:58" data-timecode="00:01:58"><a href="#t=00:01:58"><span>00:01:58</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Oh, wow.</span></p><p id="t=00:01:59" data-timecode="00:01:59"><a href="#t=00:01:59"><span>00:01:59</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Which is really, really cool. I knew about it. I remember at one point, this is traumatic for you, taking my girlfriend who was also a mathematician to see this thing. Then the two of us like, "Okay, the method of differences, let's sit down." We sat down on, there's a little patch of grass outside the Science Museum. It's not a very grassy area, sitting down on this patch of grass on a sunny day in London. That's why I remember it.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:21" data-timecode="00:02:21"><a href="#t=00:02:21"><span>00:02:21</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Very distinctive.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:24" data-timecode="00:02:24"><a href="#t=00:02:24"><span>00:02:24</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> The two of us with a piece of paper working out, okay, how does this thing work? How does the method of differences work? That was probably really when I got excited about Babbage, and then subsequently realized that the difference engine as cool as it was, isn't actually programmable and that was a bit sad.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:40" data-timecode="00:02:40"><a href="#t=00:02:40"><span>00:02:40</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Did you already know at that point that you are interested in computing?

I was doing mathematics and computation as Oxford called it because Oxford was very theoretical. It was all about the theory of computation. None of this messing around with real computers. I hadn't messed around with computers for a long time</span></p><p>because well, if you go backwards, you have to work backwards, I was obviously a child of the '80s 8-bit revolution in the UK. I had a thing called the BBC Micro which was this really cool computer with 48K RAM.</p><p id="t=00:03:14" data-timecode="00:03:14"><a href="#t=00:03:14"><span>00:03:14</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Whenever the BBC Micro is mentioned on the podcast, it's been mentioned a couple of times, I feel that all of our English listeners play God Save The Queen in the background.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:24" data-timecode="00:03:24"><a href="#t=00:03:24"><span>00:03:24</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> I feel that there is tears in the eyes.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:24" data-timecode="00:03:24"><a href="#t=00:03:24"><span>00:03:24</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Well, there were two groups, Bryan. In the UK at that time, there was the Sinclair group, ZX81, the ZX Spectrum and then there were the BBC Micro people. We were two camps and the Sinclair machines were slightly cheaper.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:43" data-timecode="00:03:43"><a href="#t=00:03:43"><span>00:03:43</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> I have got so many follow-up questions.

The Sinclair machines were much much cheaper and so I think they were much, much more widespread whereas the BBC machines were in school so you got at them at school. I ended up with the BBC machine because my parents in their wisdom, they said-- Well, they had two boys and they're like, "We'll let these two boys do the things they seem really interested in." My brother had had years and years of piano lessons and played the piano really well. I said, "I want to have a computer."</span></p><p>They said, "Well, we probably spent that much money on piano lessons so we'll buy you this machine," which I still have. It's a treasure.

They do this thing at Cambridge University in the summer where you could basically take your kids and dump them off and there your kids run wild. I went to that a couple of times and I actually hated it because some of the kids were so snotty, but there was one person I went up to and obviously, this person was in either the mathematics or computer science department at Cambridge, and I said, "Oh, explain to me how a computer works. I want to know." Imagine I'm like seven years old.</p><p>What I remember of that is the person getting out a pad of paper and starting drew this strip on it and build boxes on it and basically describe the Turing machine. I have at home, my own little Turing things I've tried to do in strips of paper and come up with this computer thing. I think I was infected with computer stuff pretty early on. Mother would say even as a baby I was fascinated by things like how does the clock work? I would stare at clocks, "How does that work?" I don't know.

Then I bought this book that was called The Advanced User's Guide, it had a lot of stuff about how the operating system or the BIOS for this thing worked and a lot of the gut there. I was very interested in that. I really learned assembly language and then started doing assembly language stuff on the machine.

It's really weird because basically, it didn't have ASCII. It had its own thing with all sorts of crazy symbols and stuff and you could type everything. Anyway, I was reading some assembly language programming basically to make my programs faster or to access bits of the operating system and build various things. Me with another boy in high school, we wrote programs. We wrote a statistical analysis package. We wrote I think, the timetabling. Then basically around this time there, we had a 100-kilobit per second I think local area network at school. We disassembled the operating system and figured out how to make it work.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Moving to microservices isn’t always just a shift in technology. It should also be accompanied by a shift in how teams are formed and the way individuals work together. Oftentimes, some of that decentralization and autonomy of teams may already exist in a monolith which makes the transition to microservices even easier.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>Conway’s law says, “Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/5fdbc13fa1cbbc7cf2f7aa69_ac8hKJXN7s8bjVLOu7FIdUd1hau5cingZJB1-bFx_Q9_EaN7jE30iccoPwNfkEr7_5UanD-QnkNs1wWE1_xUqsRhzdWD24MIq2pjSCTLEKRA2kr99PG9h6cTyriZzOxTuJKy4pwR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This organizational shift is sometimes referred to as a part of an organization’s ‘digital transformation,’ a term that is somewhat of a misnomer itself — it could just as well be called an ‘organizational transformation’ because the fundamental transformation is one in cultural and team structure -- not in the technology being used. 	<br></p><p>For some teams, part of the move to microservices could also mean throwing out legacy development practices to a more agile, DevOps approach. From a technical perspective, the way that these services communicate with each other is different as well. So, if an organization doesn’t end up adapting, then ultimately none of the benefits like speed, autonomy, and flexibility get realized in the process.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>Map teams to one or multiple services&nbsp;</strong><br></h4><p>If we accept that a microservice architecture means a software system that is made out of individually deployable, independent, lightweight and modular components -- according to Conway’s law the organization should be organized in a similar manner: Out of small, modular, independent teams who clearly own and are ultimately responsible for the microservice’s entire lifecycle.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While all these microservices interact with each other, each one of them may have its own unique or limited function. In general in a more distributed environment teams tend to rely more heavily on automation tools in order to manage the complexity of the relationship between the microservices and the tasks involved with building, testing and deploying them.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Think about autonomy, organizational structure, &amp; the development process</strong><br></h4><p>If Conway’s law holds — and while an organization continues to grow — attempting to adopt microservices without empowering your teams to have complete ownership and autonomy could ultimately end in failure. In some cases, monoliths could traditionally require a different communication structure than microservices, so organizations would need to adapt the way their team members are given a clear set of owners and accountability in order to be successful.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Development processes matter too. If organizations continue to use the same waterfall approach that focuses on ‘projects’ and involves adding features to existing microservices, they could end up with well -- many monoliths. Not true independent, lightweight microservices. In addition, development teams that throw their code over the wall to an operations team ultimately won’t reap the benefits of having the faster development cycles they’d wished for.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To succeed with microservices, organizations need to build teams that are independent, have well-defined responsibilities, with complete ownership over the service through its entire life cycle. Instead of having a development team, a security team, a networking team and an ops team, companies need every team to be cross-functional, organized around the service or services it may be responsible for. Though the services will clearly have interconnected and often complex dependencies, each service and each team has to be able to do its work independently of the other.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Always remember engineers are human :)</strong></h4><p>Embracing new technologies, whether it is containers or Kubernetes or cloud environments, may not be the most difficult piece. Engineers are human, and they work in human organizations, often with a relatively long history and strong inertia. Adopting microservices requires empowering teams so that each team is focused on delivering and maintaining a complete product rather than ‘adding features’ to an established codebase. Changing and improving a culture to succeed with microservices generally involves the following:&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Changing how developers, operators and security professionals work together. </strong>It’s hard for individuals to collaborate when they are all evaluated based on criteria that are not only different but also competing, or at least have traditionally been seen as competing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Changing perspectives about what is and is not mutually exclusive goals. </strong>There’s a common misperception that increasing development velocity inherently reduces operational stability and increases security risk, for example. That misconception makes it hard for developers, who want to deliver fast and are incentivized to do so, to work with operators, who want the application to be as reliable as possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Becoming comfortable with independence. </strong>Microservices and micromanagement don’t work well together.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taking those steps make it easier to build the cross-functional teams that organizations need in order to be successful with microservices.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You still need visibility into all of your microservices, especially because they’re interconnected. A modern microservice catalog like effx can help team members clearly own and understand how services relate to each other even if they’ve never interacted with the service owners themselves. <a href="https://www.effx.com/"><strong>If you’re curious to see how it works, take effx for a spin for free.&nbsp;</strong></a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="penci-post-entry-inner"><p>I recently read through a Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25346851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a> discussing the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> “Kafka Is Not A Database”, by <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>. The opinions behind this topic are fascinating and I enjoyed sifting through comments from both sides of the table. For the purposes of this post, I’ve labeled these two broad groups of thoughts as Team Blue and Team Red.</p><p>Team Blue believes that <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kafka</a>, a popular streaming platform, has the potential to be the source-of-truth for your data—replacing one of the key responsibilities of conventional databases.</p><p>Team Red strongly disagrees.</p><p>The following is high-level summary of these opinions.</p> <h2><strong>Kafka As A Database</strong></h2><h3>TL;DR Streams,Events,Kafka</h3><p>First, a conceptual model of streams:</p><blockquote><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, a&nbsp;<strong>stream</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">sequence</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element">data elements</a>&nbsp;made available over time.&nbsp;A stream can be thought of as items on a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt">conveyor belt</a>&nbsp;being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Imagine that you’ve hired an invisible assistant. This assistant’s only responsibility is to record everything you do:</p><ol><li>Wakes up @ 8 am</li><li>Brushes teeth @ 8:35 am</li><li>Begins showering @ 8:40 am</li><li>…</li></ol><p>As you go about your day, your assistant meticulously captures your activity and adds new entries into your daily log. This growing log represents a <strong>stream </strong>of your day-to-day activity. The data elements that comprise the stream are known as <strong>events</strong>. Once an event is recorded, it is immutable; the fact that you brushed your teeth at 8:35 am yesterday will never change.</p><p>While your invisible assistant is following you around and <strong>producing</strong> new events to your stream, who is <strong>consuming</strong> them? Anyone who cares! I’m sure your mom would be thrilled to process through your activities and call you if there are any anomalies.</p><p>What about <strong>Kafka</strong>?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-source</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stream-processing</a>&nbsp;software platform developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Software Foundation</a>, written in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scala</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java</a>.&nbsp;</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Kafka is a platform (large set of software tools) that helps programmers work with streams.</p><h2>Team Blue – Streams Everywhere</h2><p>Team Blue believes that streams are a natural model for both life and computing. Your users produce a stream of clicks, sign-ups, and orders. Your code produces a stream of logs, metrics, and programmatic events. Team Blue believes that the intuitive nature of streams can lead to intuitive software architectures.</p><p>An essential component of any system is the database—a convenient place to read and write whatever you want. How can a stream replace this concept that we are so used to? If streams are a never-ending series of immutable events, then the property of state is the culmination of events up to a certain point in time. For example, the latest state of a database is the culmination of all operations made to that database. In computing, this is referred to as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Sourcing</a>. This paradigm is very different to how many developers are used to thinking about their data.</p><p>Beyond data storage, Team Blue is bullish on the idea of stream-focused architectures in general. Streams work well with microservices, promote loose coupling of systems, and have the potential to create leverage in your software. If you’re thinking about streams, you will inevitably think about Kafka—one of the industry’s leading streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Can</strong> you use Kafka as a database? Team Blue says yes.</p><p><strong>Should</strong> you use Kafka as a database? That’s up to you.</p><h2>Team Red – You Need Databases</h2><p>On the other side of the table is Team Red who believes that programmers are making a mistake by replacing conventional databases with Kafka.</p><p>Team Red believes that 99% of applications need the features of a conventional database—especially the features handling complex concurrency issues. Many of us use these features and they are critical for the success of our applications. Modern databases are battle-tested and have been iterated on for decades. Team Red believes that the message of “Kafka As A Database” is a dangerous message that leads developers into architectures they’re not equipped to handle.</p><h2>The People On Each Team</h2><p>There is no shortage of influential people who align with Team Blue. One notable engineer is <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Kreps</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confluent</a>. Confluent is an organization that sells Kafka as a solution to enterprises. There is a direct correlation between using streams and using Kafka; I’m sure Jay has a few extra reasons to be bullish on streams beyond his personal software architecture preferences.</p><p>Another influencer aligned with Team Blue is <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a>, author of the extremely popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. Martin Kleppmann is a researcher who loves the idea of streams. His goal is to educate as many programmers as possible. Martin’s only qualm with Team Red’s opinion is the tone of their blog post. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1336336852890963977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nice blog post [Kafka Is Not A Database] explaining why the “database inside out” approach is not for everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun">@narayanarjun</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew">@frasergeorgew</a> are right —&nbsp;if you need to maintain constraints before events are written (e.g. not selling more items than you have in stock), it’s easier to use a DB and CDC.</p><p>On the other hand, the message is also a bit patronising. It basically says “you’re not clever enough to use an event log correctly — leave database stuff to the experts”. I respectfully disagree: it is good to explore new approaches. Learn about the trade-offs, educate yourself.</p><cite>Martin Kleppmann</cite></blockquote><p>Engineers on Team Red’s side include <a href="https://materialize.com/author/arjun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://materialize.com/author/george-fraser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>, co-authors of the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> which refutes the idea of “Kafka As A Database.” They have decided to put a large, yellow caution sign in front of Team Blue’s message. Team Red has no issue with Kafka or streams; they have an issue with eager developers throwing out their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDMSs</a> and jumping on the stream bandwagon. Their only extra agenda might be to get extra eyeballs on their engineering blogs.</p><h2>Arguments From Team Blue</h2><p>The following points are summaries of topics discussed in Martin Kleppmann’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0&amp;t=2089s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>.</p><h3>High Integrity Data – Never Deleted</h3><p>With a database, your information is easily susceptible to being lost. Once your Postgres row is updated, it’s difficult to recover the previous state of that row without introducing custom accountability software. Databases and the records inside them are designed to be mutable. It’s both a great convenience and a great risk. If a table accidentally gets deleted, you might find yourself scrambling to restore your database from a backup. This is particularly painful in production.</p><p>On the other hand, if your data exists as a log of immutable events—and that log happens to be retained forever—the history of your changes never runs the risk of being erased. Accounting is a great example of this—accountants balance their books by only appending new entries to their ledgers. An error in a financial transaction is always fixed by another transaction.</p><p>Team Blue believes that this characteristic can be an asset to software architectures. As a permanent log of events, data will always have its historical context and can easily be audited. Furthermore, the lack of an “eraser” forces programmers and processes to be held highly accountable for their actions.</p><div> <p><span>Trade-Off</span>: </p><p> One concern of storing all your data in a log is that the size of your logs may become unwieldy over time. Do we really care about how a customer changed their email 3 years ago or do we only care about what it is today? Large Kafka logs can also complicate consumers—catching up from offset 0 may not be so easy. Kafka has implemented features like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Log Compaction </a> to mitigate this. However, this is yet another complexity for programmers to manage and debug. </p><p> Another trade-off of this architecture is that it can become cumbersome for privacy concerns. There are administrative use-cases (GDPR) when you are required to completely <strong>hard delete</strong> all of your customer’s personal information from your system. This takes additional effort if the data to be deleted is scattered across logs and storage systems.</p></div><h3>Separation Of Concerns – Reading / Writing</h3><p>Team Blue points out that one of the great conveniences of databases is also one of its greatest challenges. The convenience of databases is undeniable—an easy one-stop shop to read and write anything. The drawback to being a one-stop shop is that you can’t be the best at any <strong>one</strong> thing, which becomes problematic as you scale.</p><p>Conventional databases easy conflate reads and writes, two very different styles of operations. As you scale, the access patterns in your software will inevitably force you to optimize for a certain set of operations. If an operation-specific optimization is done in a centralized location, it will likely degrade the performance of other operations in that location. If you optimize reads, you complicate writes—and vice versa.</p><p>One of the first steps in optimizing SQL reads is to begin denormalizing (duplicating) data across various tables. Once your data is duplicated, queries require less joins and respond faster. However, the drawback of denormalization is that it creates additional complications on the write pathway. Programmers need to remember to update and synchronize the duplicated data across multiple tables.</p><p>This pattern grows in complexity as you scale. If denormalization isn’t getting you the required read performance, the usual next step is to introduce a cache in front of your database. A cache is extremely convenient and can be designed to precisely answer the questions your clients are asking. However, as many programmers are intimately aware of, maintaining a cache is never easy. You now to need synchronize writes across network boundaries, worry about distributed transactions, and debug subtle invalidation issues.</p><p>Going back to our make-believe example, my assistant only has <strong>one</strong> responsibility—log my daily activity. One day, I decide that I want to look back in time to see how my activities are categorized. Unfortunately, I can’t ask my assistant this question because it’s too specific; all he knows how to do is produce events. To get insights on my activity, …</p></div></div></div>

		<em>How do you design good abstractions? By using abstractions that already exist.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was a boy, I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck">cassette tape player</a>. It came with playback controls like these:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/playback-controls.png" alt="Rewind, play/pause, and fast forward symbols.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Soon after cassette players had become widely adopted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">VCR</a> manufacturers figured out that they could reuse those symbols to make their machines easier to use. Everyone could play a video tape, but 'no one' could 'program' them, because, while playback controls were already universally understood by consumers, each VCR came with its own proprietary interface for 'programming'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player">CD players</a>. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		MP3 players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		Streaming audio and video players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you download an app that plays music, odds are that you'll find it easy to get started playing music. One reason is that all playback apps seem to have the same common set of controls. It's an abstraction that you already know.

	</h3>
	<p>
		As I explain in my <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-1/show">Humane Code</a> video, you can't program without abstractions. To summarise, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">the words of Robert C. Martin</a>
		</p><blockquote>
			"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential"
		</blockquote><p>
		With such abstractions, source code becomes easier to understand. Like everything else, there's no silver bullet, but good coding abstractions can save you much grief, and make it easier to understand big and complex code bases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only can a good abstraction shield you from having to understand all the details in a big system, but if you're familiar with the abstraction, you may be able to quickly get up to speed.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the above definition is great for identifying a good abstraction, it doesn't tell you how to create one.
	</p>

		Design patterns <a href="#d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a> explains that a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. As I interpret the original intent of the Gang of Four, the book was an attempt to collect and abstract solutions that were repeatedly observed 'in the wild'. The design patterns in the book are <em>descriptive</em>, not prescriptive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are useful in two ways:
		</p><ul>
			<li>They offer solutions</li>
			<li>They form a vocabulary</li>
		</ul><p>
		In my opinion, however, people often overlook the second advantage. Programmers are often eager to find <em>solutions</em>. "I have a problem; what's the solution? Oh, here's a design pattern that fits!"
	</p>
	<p>
		I have no problems with ready-made solutions, but I think that the other advantage may be even bigger. When you're looking at unfamiliar source code, you struggle to understand how it's structured, and what it does. If, hypothetically, you discover that pieces of that unfamiliar source code follows a design pattern that you know, then understanding the code becomes much easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two criteria for this to happen:
		</p><ul>
			<li>The reader (you) must already know the pattern</li>
			<li>The original author (also you?) must have implemented the pattern without any surprising deviations</li>
		</ul><p>
		As a programmer (code author), you can help readers (users) of your code. Don't use every design pattern in the book, but when you use one, make it as obvious to the reader as you can: Use the terminology, class names, and so on from the book. Add comments where your naming deviates. Add links that the novice user can follow to learn more.
	</p>

		Ambiguous specification <a href="#3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Programming to a well-known abstraction is a force multiplier, but it does require that those two conditions are satisfied: prior knowledge, and correct implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know how to solve the <em>prior knowledge</em> requirement, other than to tell you to study. I do, however, think that it's possible to formalise some of the known design patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most design patterns are described in some depth. They come with sections on motivation, when to use and not to use, diagrams, and example code. Furthermore, they also come with an overview of <em>variations</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picture this: as a reader, you've just identified that the code you're looking at is an implementation of a design pattern. Then you realise that it isn't structured like you'd expect, or that its behaviour surprises you. Was the author incompetent, after all?
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're inclined to believe the worst about your fellow (wo)man, you look up the original pattern, and there it is: the author is using a variation of the pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are ambiguous.

	</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Design Patterns</em> was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be <em>intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's the most intuitive abstractions ever?
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay with me, please. If you're a normal reader of my blog, you're most likely an 'industry programmer' or <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">enterprise developer</a>. You're not interested in mathematics. Perhaps mathematics even turns you off, and at the very least, you never had use for mathematics in programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may not find <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology">differential topology</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus">stochastic calculus</a>, intuitive, but that's not the kind of mathematics I have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basic arithmetic is intuitive. You know: <em>1 + 3 = 4</em>, or <em>3 * 4 = 12</em>. In fact, it's <em>so intuitive</em> that you can't formally prove it -without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a>, that is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">These axioms</a> are unprovable; you must take them at face value, but you'll readily do that because they're <em>so intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics is a big structure, but it's all based on intuitive axioms. Mathematics is intuitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writers before me have celebrated the power of mathematical abstraction in programming. For instance, in <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">Domain-Driven Design</a> Eric Evans discusses how <em>Closure of Operations</em> leads to object models reminiscent of arithmetic. If you can design <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> in such a way that you can somehow 'add' them together, you have an intuitive and powerful abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that there's more than one way to combine numbers. You can add them together, but you can also multiply them. Could there be a common abstraction for that? What about objects that can somehow be combined, even if they aren't 'number-like'? The generalisation of such operations is a branch of mathematics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, and it has turned out to be productive when applied to functional programming. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is the most prominent example.
	</p>
	<p>
		By an interesting coincidence, the 'things' in category theory are called <em>objects</em>, and while they aren't objects in the sense that we think of in object-oriented design, there <em>is</em> some equivalence. Category theory concerns itself with how objects map to other objects. A functional programmer would interpret such <em>morphisms</em> as functions, but in a sense, you can also think of them as well-defined behaviour that's associated with data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The objects of category theory are universal abstractions. Some of them, it turns out, coincide with known design patterns. The difference is, however, that category theory concepts are governed by specific laws. In order to be a functor, for example, an object must obey certain simple and intuitive laws. This makes the category theory concepts more specific, and less ambiguous, than design patterns.

		I believe that learning about these universal abstractions is the next step in software design. If you know design patterns, you have a vocabulary, but the details are still open to interpretation. If you know category theory, you have a better vocabulary. Just like design patterns, you have to learn these things, but once you've learned them, you've learned something that transcends a particular software library, a particular framework, a particular programming language. Learning about functors, monoids, and so on, is a good investment, because these concepts are rooted in mathematics, not any particular technology.

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>When you don’t have the option to authenticate into your computer or smartphone with a biometric the backup option is a pin code. Why isn’t it a password? Surely the 8+ characters with some capital letters and mixed in exclamation marks used to log in to your email account is much more secure than the four to six digits that stand between an intruder and full access to your iPhone, laptop or iPad, right? Actually, that PIN is much more secure than your password, and knowing why it is more secure corrects a lot of the misunderstandings about authentication and security.</p>

<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
<p>A common trope in password security is that more complexity equals more security. You may have even seen <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2012/04/07/how-secure-is-your-password/">this chart</a> going around that showed how long it would take for a hacker to crack a password based on the complexity of said password. The intended take away was that if a password is sufficiently long and has enough special characters you don’t need to worry about a hacker figuring it out for at least a few hundred years. But people’s passwords are compromised all the time, even extremely complex ones. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Entire services</a> exist just for people to regularly check if any of their passwords are in the wrong hands. This is because the real vulnerability of passwords does not come from their lack of complexity, but rather where they are stored.</p>
<p>A password is stored on a server. Most stolen passwords come from these servers getting breached, not from a hacker spending hours or months trying different combinations of letters and numbers until they’ve figured out your Netflix login. A PIN is stored on the device and nowhere else. If Apple were to have a breach and a hacker accessed their servers the hacker would not find your PIN code, because it is not there.</p>

<h2>Possession is Nine Tenths of the Law</h2>
<p>Let’s assume someone gets your password, presumably from a breach. All they need is your username or email address which is usually publicly available and they can access your accounts from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let’s assume someone knows your PIN. The PIN code does not grant remote access, it is only useful to whomever is in possession of the device.</p>

<h2>Look Ma, First Try!</h2>
<p>For a four-digit pin code there are 10,000 combinations and for a six-digit pin code there are a million possible combinations. This may seem high but compare it to an 8-digit password with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers which will give you 457,163,239,653,376 possible combinations and you find it is quite trivial. So why don’t people use brute force attacks on PINs? Just use a software or hardware (imagine a robotic finger) that tries all combinations until it is cracked like they do to crack passwords? This plays into another myth about complexity being more secure. Password complexity actually prevents the use of security protocols used to protect PIN codes.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that an attacker would have to have the phone in their physical possession to start trying combinations as we discussed earlier, PIN authentication has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/tpm-fundamentals#anti-hammering">anti-hammering</a> measures in place that prevent too many attempts. For an <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-how-to-reset-your-android-lock-screen-passwordpinpattern/">Android phone you get 10 attempts</a> to enter the correct PIN or else you must perform a factory reset on the phone deleting all its contents. iPhones have a system in which <a href="http://businessinsider.com/iphone-security-failed-passcode-attempts-2018-6">the time you must wait between attempts increases after each incorrect PIN entry</a>, to the point where it would take three hours to try 10 different pin combinations. They also have the option to wipe phone data after 10 incorrect attempts.</p>
<p>Why can’t passwords have this kind of security? Seems like it would eliminate the existence of brute force attacks all together. The answer is: passwords are harder to remember than PINs. It is assumed that everyone knows their PIN number, after all, it’s just four digits. Therefore the expectation that it is entered on the first (or second due to fat fingers) attempt correctly can dictate their protocols. On the other hand, passwords have added complexity intended to make them more secure, and also have reset requirements. These “features” make passwords much harder to remember (which is easier ‘5240’ or ‘<a href="https://www.beyondidentity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="dbb99ab59bb5baa9ba9696baeeef">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>!0’) and therefore the authentication system has to be more lenient towards multiple attempts, sometimes even offer clues, or allow you to reset them via email. Combined, these things make the password more vulnerable to brute force or social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>In short, because pin codes are simpler they can actually have more stringent security surrounding them than something more complex like a password.</p>

<h2>What About Those Codes for 2-Factor Authentication?</h2>
<p>The four to six-digit code that is sent to your mobile device after entering a password as a second factor of authentication is wholly different from a PIN and not nearly as secure. The code, like a password, is stored outside of your device and has to be sent to your device over a network of some kind, making it vulnerable to breaches and interception.</p>

<p><span>J</span>oão Carlos Martins still performs even while stranded at home during a pandemic. Dressed in a dark shirt and slacks, the 80-year-old Brazilian pianist and conductor sits on the couch at his São Paulo duplex apartment, gesturing while he talks, as if in command of an orchestra. The motioning also showcased an unusual pair of black neoprene half-gloves that Martins, one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/arts/classical-music-a-life-stranger-than-art-even-his-eccentric-art.html?searchResultPosition=11">most acclaimed interpreters</a> of Bach, wears at practically every waking hour, and sometimes even to sleep.</p>



<p>Two decades ago, he started replacing the grand piano with the baton, as a series of injuries and chronic diseases slowly compromised the movement of his hands. After a decades-long pursuit for a cure that took him through 24 surgeries and every high-tech medical therapy money could buy, it ended up being those gloves — a simple workaround created by a Brazilian industrial designer with no medical training — that brought his hands back to life.</p>



<p>He quit the piano for good in early 2019, right before he underwent his 24th operation, which made him lose all dexterity in his left hand, ending any possibility of the maestro ever playing again. He observed the occasion with an emotional appearance on <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/7389347/">Brazilian national television</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stepping away from the instrument felt like “carrying a corpse” in the chest, Martins said.<strong><em> </em></strong>But ten months later, he was back at his piano bench, tearfully playing the instrument while wearing the neoprene gloves, with full use of his hands for the first time in two decades.</p>



<div><p>That extraordinary comeback began in July 2019, at a tour stop in Sumaré, upstate São Paulo, when the maestro opened his dressing room door before conducting his orchestra <a href="https://www.sesisp.org.br/cultura/bachiana-filarmonica-sesi-sp">Bachiana Filarmônica</a> to find a local resident carrying a box.</p><p>Industrial designer Ubiratan Bizarro watched Martins’ final piano performance months earlier on TV and took it upon himself to find a way to help. He binge-watched videos of Martins’ piano performances, taking screenshots and zooming in to analyze his hand movements.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>He then developed a prototype: a pair of neoprene half-gloves with a stiff structure and plastic extensions on each finger tip. That first pair, however, turned out to be something “suitable for boxing, at best,” as Martins chuckled in conversation with <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I kept thinking that this guy had shown a real interest, so I invited him over for lunch and explained what had happened to my hands.”&nbsp;</p>

      <figcaption>The gloves took five months and six prototypes to develop.</figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>As a teenager, Martins developed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662617/">focal dystonia</a>, a neurological condition that causes involuntary body movements. As a result, his fingers tend to twitch: not ideal when tickling the ivories. Over the years, he gradually lost control of his hands. His long hours of practice also cost him a severe <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/repetitive-strain-injury">repetitive strain injury</a> (RSI), which led to recurrent pain. “Every time my fingers would hit a key, it felt like getting stabbed.”<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Other injuries also damaged his nervous system. In 1966, Martins fell to the ground during a soccer game in Central Park, New York, and the injury to a nerve in his arm caused him to lose part of the movements in his right hand.</p>



<p>In the mid-1990s, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703376504575492052972871316">muggers in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia</a> gave him a concussion that kept him in the hospital for eight months, while the right side of his body remained partially paralyzed. It would be a full year until he could play again.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Martins fought through these health issues. Since the symptoms of his dystonia were less intense right after he woke up, he used to take naps on dressing room floors before every concert. Benefiting from a “great predisposition to sleep wherever I want,” Martins described how he could fall asleep by 3 p.m. and wake 15 minutes before a show. At one point during each concert, the pain from the RSI got so bad that only what he called an “adrenaline rush” kept him going long enough to finish the performance. Thus, when Bizarro knocked on his door last year, Martins figured he had nothing to lose.</p><p>The pianist described the parts of his hands that still worked, demonstrating how he could still press down his fingers but could not move them back up. He also showed Bizarro how he lost part of his hand muscles and nerves, cut off during multiple surgeries.</p><p>The designer left the maestro’s apartment and dove back into YouTube, where he studied videos about car mechanics and aerodynamics. “I recalled a team at Formula One and the springs in their car suspension, and I thought I could use something similar,” Bizarro told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Using his 3D printer, Bizarro remade the neoprene glove from scratch. It took five months and six prototypes. The final version had flexible steel rods that connected the fingers to the hand’s back; whenever the maestro pressed a key, each rod would bring the finger back to its original place, with a simple spring movement. Instead of attempting to fix the complex neurological condition, the gloves tackled the most elementary mechanics of the maestro’s hands.</p>

<p>When Martins showed his medical team the sixth prototype, it received immediate approval. They were already familiar with the long list of therapies the pianist had undergone — from Botox to a neural stimulating device implanted in Martins’ brain cortex in 2012. “We already knew that gloves could not worsen his condition, whose source is in the cortex,” said Rames Mattar, the orthopedic surgeon who led his last surgery, to <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mattar stressed that the device wasn’t a cure and that his patient was well aware of that. “But who would have thought,” the maestro asked, “that a designer without medical training could create such a thing?”</p>



<p>With the doctors’ stamp of approval and the gloves on his hands, Martins made his first attempt to play the grand piano again in his living room during Christmas 2019. For the first time in 22 years, he hit the keys with all ten fingers, playing a rendition of a Chopin’s nocturne. He shared the first of many videos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6c3-4FHUgs/">on Instagram</a>, and Brazilians flooded his profile with emotional comments. His short homemade piano recitals reached new audiences when they were shared by U.S. celebrities <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman">Rex Chapman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/violadavis/status/1310787380920619010">Viola Davis</a>.</p>



<p>Bizarro now is selling versions of Martins’ “extensor gloves” online for $250. They come in three different sizes and can be shipped to clients in Europe, India, and the United States.</p>



<p>The maestro is now rarely seen without his gloves. His practice sessions go on for so long — four hours daily — that he relies on a silent piano to work on his hand movements so as to not upset the downstairs neighbors, but when he has to rehearse for a concert, the maestro goes full volume. Martins understands that this might not be his definite comeback, since the dystonia has crept back to his hands before. “If in a couple of years, my condition also beats these gloves, I’ll confront it,” he said. “I’ve already had to change the way I play a hundred times.”</p>

    <p>In <a href="https://uwekorn.com/2021/01/04/first-two-weeks-with-the-m1.html">the previous blog post</a> I explained how I got a well-working setup on my M1 MacBook. With that in place, I mostly worked on my main work setup running. But as a core Apache Arrow developer, I was also very eager to spend the extra mile and get Arrow (the C++ and Python part) working on the M1. As outlined in the previous post, I used <code>conda-forge</code> as the source for all dependencies and Arrow itself to build binary packages.</p>

<p>If you are eager to use <code>pyarrow</code> on the M1, you can install it just as every other conda package using</p>

<div><div><pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you still need to setup <code>conda</code> on the M1 <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/blob/master/README.md">conda-forge already has native installers for it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-arrow-using-cross-compilation-on-ci">Building Arrow using cross-compilation on CI</h2>

<p>Building Arrow C++ for the new architecture also meant building all its dependencies for the new architecture. Luckily as clang and the macOS SDK support cross-compiling, we could already start to build the conda-forge packages before the first machines were shipped. Most of the changes were straight-forward as <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2020-10-29-macos-arm64/">outlined in the conda-forge post about <code>osx-arm64</code></a> as most dependencies used either CMake or autotools for their build system.</p>

<p>We only had issues with packages that called themselves during the build phase. Here we couldnâ€™t use the builds for <code>osx-arm64</code> as Rosetta 2 only supports running Intel code on Arm64 devices, not the other way around. Thus, in this case, we had to build the Intel and the ARM version in CI and point to the correct executables to be used during the cross-compilation build.</p>

<p>An example of a dependency that called itself is <code>grpc-cpp</code>. This compiles a <code>protoc</code> plugin and then calls that later in the process to compile some gRPC-specific protobuf files. <code>conda-build</code> by itself already supports cross-compilation by having a <code>build</code> (what you need to compile) and a <code>host</code> (the dependencies you link to) section in its requirements. As we are going to build gRPC twice, we needed to duplicate its host dependencies also in the build section. Using <code>conda-build</code>â€™s selectors we can limit that though to only the cases where we are doing a cross-compilation.</p>

<p>Similarly, we changed the <code>build.sh</code> to build gRPC for the current architecture when <code>$CONDA_BUILD_CROSS_COMPILATION</code> is set. The compiler packages on conda-forge define for that case special environment variables <code>$CC_FOR_BUILD</code> and <code>$CXX_FOR_BUILD</code> that contain the compilers for the architecture the build is running on. Sadly with the CMake setup we have in the conda-forge setup, gRPCâ€™s CMake setup doesnâ€™t detect that we are cross-compiling and chooses the wrong protobuf compiler. Thus we supplied the following patch that hardcodes the variables for the case we are using in our build scripts. With that it was sufficient to pass <code>-DProtobuf_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=$BUILD_PREFIX/bin/protoc</code> to the CMake command line to get the build passing. The gRPC build for the local architecture was detected automatically as we have installed it into the <code>$BUILD_PREFIX</code>.</p>

<p>With all the dependencies built, it was now time to adjust the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock"><code>arrow-cpp-feedstock</code>, the repository that defines the conda-forge build for <code>arrow-cpp</code> and <code>pyarrow</code></a>. The fleet of conda-forge bots already <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock/pull/195">made an automatic PR</a> once all the dependencies were built. Sadly this didnâ€™t work out of the box due to Arrowâ€™s rather complicated setup. The first thing we needed to do was to also supply the <code>build</code>-dependencies needed for cross-compilation to the <code>pyarrow</code> and not only the <code>arrow-cpp</code> output.</p>

<p>As at this point LLVM 10 wasnâ€™t built for <code>osx-arm64</code>, we also disabled Gandiva for now. Meanwhile, this has been built for the new architecture, so we will probably test and reenable it soon. Also, we needed to adjust the line in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for Arrow Flight to have it find the right gRPC protobuf plugin. Otherwise, it would always have used the one for the target architecture that wouldnâ€™t run on CI.</p>

<p>Due to some issues with the build and failing tests reported by other uses, we also disabled the most performant allocators backed by jemalloc and mimalloc for now. As they use things that are heavily depending on system internals, they needed more adjustments and testing as they would otherwise prohibit the successful import of the <code>pyarrow</code> Python module.</p>

<p>At this point, we have built <code>arrow-cpp</code> and <code>pyarrow</code> packages but donâ€™t know whether they work as we donâ€™t have a machine to test on. Still, this was a major boost in getting things running as we would otherwise have spent a week or more waiting for everything to be built before we could test anything once I got my hands on an M1.</p>

<h2 id="cmake-issues">CMake Issues</h2>

<p>Once my MacBook with an M1 processor arrived, I also came to the point where everything was running so smoothly that I could finally invest some time into building Arrow natively on the M1. This directly runs into the issue that the <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</code> is slightly different on macOS with the system being detected as supporting AVX2. As this is an x86-only instruction set, the compilation failed with errors about invalid assembly instructions. The underlying issue here was <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</code> was <code>arm64</code> whereas the other ARM systems we have yet built Arrow on reported it either as <code>ARM64</code> or <code>aarch64</code>. We could resolve this in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10873">ARROW-10873</a> / <a href="https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apache/arrow/pull/8893">PR#8893</a> with a simple patch and got Arrow to build natively, too.</p>

<h2 id="codesigning-issues-with-gtest">Codesigning Issues with gtest</h2>

<p>Once Arrow C++ was built locally, running the tests sadly lead to all of them failing. Typically when everything fails, one would expect a <code>Segmentation fault</code> as the error message but in that case, we only got <code>Killed.</code>. Even weirder, when trying to debug a test, the call to <code>lldb -- testcase</code> also got <code>Killed.</code>. Not the test broke but also the debugger didnâ€™t start if we supplied an Arrow test as the binary. This is something that I have never seen on any platform before. Even more surprising was that you could start <code>lldb</code> after you have restarted your system and the test would run. But once you have run the test in <code>lldb</code> or if you have run the test after a system restart without <code>lldb</code>, <code>lldb</code> itself would get a <code>Killed.</code> again. <em>As weird as it sounds, this was reproducible after a lot of restarts and a good night of sleep.</em></p>

<p>Even more troubling to me was that linking also failed once you have executed a test and did a clean build (<code>rm -rf build</code>).</p>

                    <p>The demand for data engineers is growing rapidly. According to <a href="http://hired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">hired.com</a> the <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="3" data-reactroot="">demand has increased by 45%</a> in 2019. The median salary for Data Engineers in SF Bay Area is around $160k. So the question is: how to become a data engineer?<!--StartFragment--></p>
<h2>What Data Engineering is</h2>
<p>Data engineering is closely related to data as you can see from its name. But if data analytics usually means extracting insights from existing data, data engineering means the process of building infrastructure to deliver, store and process the data. According to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">The AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>, the data engineering proccess is located at the very bottom: Collect, Move &amp; Store, Data Preparation. So if your organization wants to be data/AI-driven then they should hire/train data engineers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png" data-image="1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png"></figure>

<p>But what data engineers actually do? The amount of data is growing rapidly every single day. We are contemplating the new era where everybody can do a content from their mobile phone and other gadgets. Even small devices are connected to the Internet. Data engineers from the past were responsible for writing complex SQL queries, building ETL (extract, transform &amp; load) processes using big enterprise tools like Informatica ETL, Pentaho ETL, Talend etc. But now the market demands more broader skillset. If you want to work as a data engineer you need to have:</p>
<ul><li>Intermediate knowledge of SQL and Python</li><li>Experience working with cloud providers like AWS, Azure or GCP</li><li>The knowledge of Java/Scala is a big plus</li><li>Understading SQL/NoSQL databases (data modeling, data warehousing, performance optimization)</li></ul>
<p>The skillset is very similar to what Backend engineers usually know. In reality if an organization is growing in terms of data the ideal candidate to transform into data engineer is a backend engineer.</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<p>The particular technologies and tools could differ due to company size, data volumes and data velocity. If we look at the FAANG for example, they usually require:</p>
<ul><li>Knowledge of Python, Java or Scala</li><li>Experience working with Big data tools like Apache Hadoop, Kafka and Spark</li><li>Solid knowledge of algorithms and data structures</li><li>Undestanding of distributed systems</li><li>Experience with Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, QlikView, Looker or Superset</li></ul>
<h2>Data Engineer's Skillset</h2>
<p>Data engineering is an engineering area that is why the knowledge of computer science fundamentals is required, especially the understanding of most popular algorithms and data structures (Hello Mr. Cormen!).</p>
<p>Because data engineers deal with the data on a daily basis understading how databases work is a huge plus. For example, the most popular SQL databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL use B-Tree data structure under the hood.</p>
<h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
<p>If you prefer video courses I would recommend to look at the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization</a>. I took these courses and think they are quite good as a starting point.</p>
<p>Speaking about talks I would highly recommend take a look at Alex Petrov's presentation called <em>What Every Programmer has to know about Database Storage:</em></p>
<figure><iframe width="100%" height="497" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1wbQPbFZdk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></iframe></figure>
<p>Alex has a great series of posts related to databases:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Courses, video presentations are good but what about books? I would recommend the only book by Thomas Cormen and friends called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=74742875db503b1a899ca35159749067">Introduction to Algorithms</a>. The most comprehensive reference on algorithms and data structures. To practice and strengthen your knowlegde go to <a href="http://leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a> and start solving problems. Practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>Databases are great, Carnegie Mellon University uploads their lessons to Youtube:</p>

</ul>
<h3>SQL — the lingua franca for databases</h3>
<p>SQL was developed back in 70s and still is the most popular language to work with data. Periodically some experts claim that SQL is going to die very soon, but it is still alive despite many rumors. I think we will stick to SQL for another decade or two (or even more). If you look at the modern and popular databases you will see that almost all of them support SQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB</li>
<li>Amazon Redshift, Apache Druid, Yandex ClickHouse</li>
<li>HP Vertica, Greenplum</li>
</ul>
<p>In a big data ecosystem there are many different SQL engines: Presto (Trino), Hive, Impala etc. I would highly recommend to invest some time to master SQL.</p>
<p>If you are new to SQL, start with the Mode's SQL guide: <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/">Introduction to SQL</a>. If you feel comfortable you can continue with the <a href="https://bit.ly/2XrRH4i" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">DataCamp's interactive courses</a>. I would recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-sql?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">Intermediate SQL</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The best resources on SQL are <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">Modern SQL</a> and <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">Use The Index, Luke!</a> Practice makes perfect that is why go to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/">Leetcode Databases problemset</a> and start practicing 💪 By the way, do not forget to read my article on <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">SQL window functions</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Programming: Python, Java and Scala</h3>
<p>Python is a very popular programming language to build web apps as well as for data analytics &amp; science. It has a very rich ecosystem and huge community. According to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a> Python is in the Top 3 widely used programming languages after C &amp; Java.</p>
<p>Speaking about other 2 languages, many big data systems are written in Java or Scala:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Kafka (Scala)</li>
<li>Hadoop HDFS (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Spark (Scala)</li>
<li>Apache Cassandra (Java)</li>
<li>HBase (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Hive, Presto in Java</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to undestand how these systems work I would recommend to know the language in which they are written. The biggest concern with Python is its poor performance hence the knowledge of a more efficient language will be a big plus to your skillset.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Scala, I would recommend to take a look at <a href="https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/">Twitter's Scala School</a>. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981531687/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0981531687&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=69314619f1e546e3921eb97c72cf4850">Programming in Scala</a> by its creator is also a good starting point.</p>
<h3>The Big Data Tools</h3>
<p>There are lots of different technologies in a Big Data landscape. The most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apache Kafka</strong> is the leading message queue/event bus/event streaming</li>
<li><strong>Apache Spark</strong> is the unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing</li>
<li><strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>, the big data framework which consists of different tools, libraries and frameworks including distributed file system (HDFS), Apache Hive, HBase etc.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Druid</strong> is a real-time analytics database</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really difficult to learn everything that is why focus on the most popular and learn fundamental concepts behind them. For example, back in 2013 Jay Kreps (co-founder of Apache Kafka) wrote the paper called <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction</a>.</p>
<h3>Cloud Platforms</h3>
<p>Everything goes to the clouds. You should have experience working with at least one cloud provider. I would recommend go with the <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> which is the leading cloud provider in the world. The second place goes to the <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, the third place takes <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>.</p>
<p>All providers have certifications. For example, the most suitable certification for a data engineer in AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">AWS Certified Data Analytics – Specialty</a>. If you decide to proceed with GCP the right choice is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer">Professional Data Engineer</a>, for MSA is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-engineer">Azure Data Engineer Associate</a>.</p>
<h3>Fundamentals of Distributed Systems</h3>
<p>The amount of data generated nowadays is tremendous. You cannot fit it into one computer. The data should be distributed across different nodes. If you want to be a good data engineer you have to understand the fundamentals of distributed systems. There are lots of resources where you can start your journey into this field:</p>

<h3>Data Pipelines</h3>
<p>Building a data pipeline is one of the main responsibilities of a data engineer. Data pipeline is a process of data consolidation. Data engineer should be able to reliably deliver, load and transform data from multiple sources into a specific destination, usually it is central data warehouse or data lake. There are many tools which can help you build this process. Take a look at the <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/introduction-to-apache-airflow/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> from Spotify, <a href="https://www.prefect.io/">Prefect</a> or <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a>. If you prefer nocode solution <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">Apache NiFi</a> is a way to go.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Data engineer is a team player who is working with data analysts, scientists, infrastructure engineers and other stakeholders. So do not forget about soft skills like empathy, understanding a business domain, open-mindedness etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Back in December 2019, a few months after I started hacking on Google VRP, I was looking at YouTube. I wanted to find a way to get access to a <code>Private</code> video which I did not own.</p>

<p>When you upload a video to YouTube, you can select between 3 privacy settings. <code>Public</code>, which means that anyone can find and watch your video, <code>Unlisted</code>, which only allows users who know the video ID (the URL) to watch the video, and <code>Private</code>, where only you can watch the video, or other accounts you’ve explicitly given permission to do so.</p>

<p>First thing I did was to upload a video to my second testing account’s YouTube channel, and set the video’s privacy to <code>Private</code>, so I can use that video for testing. <em>(Remember, always only test against resources/accounts you own!)</em> If I can find a way to access that video with my first testing account, we have a bug.</p>

<p>With my first account, I started using YouTube, trying every feature, pressing every button I could find, and whenever I saw an HTTP request with a video ID in it, I changed it to the target <code>Private</code> video, hoping that I can leak some information about it, but I wasn’t really getting any success. The main YouTube site (at least the endpoints I have tested), seems to always check if the video was <code>Private</code> or not, and when trying to request info about the target <code>Private</code> video, they always returned errors such as <code>This video is private!</code>.</p>

<p>I needed to find another way.</p>

<p>A great thing to do in a situation like this, is to try to look for other products/services which are not your main target, but are somehow interacting with its resources internally. If they have access to its resources, it might be possible that they don’t have every level of protection that the main product has.</p>

<p>An interesting target which matched these requirements was Google Ads. This is the product which advertisers use to create ads across all Google services, <em>including YouTube</em>. So, the ads you get before YouTube videos are set up by advertisers here, on the Google Ads platform.</p>

<p>So I created a Google Ads account, and created a new advertisement, which would play a video of mine as a skippable ad for YouTube users. During the ad creation process, I also tried to use the target <code>Private</code> video’s ID wherever I could, but no success.</p>

<p>After creating the ad, I started looking at all of the different Google Ads features. The thing was huge, it had a bunch of different settings/tools. I was trying to find anything that could be YouTube-related.</p>

<p>There was a page called <code>Videos</code>, where I could see a list of videos used by my advertisements. Clicking on a video opened up an <code>Analytics</code> section for that specific video. It had an embedded player, some statistics, and an interesting feature called <code>Moments</code>. It allowed advertisers to “mark” specific moments of the video, to see when different things happen (such as the timestamp of when the company logo appears). To be honest I am not quite sure what advertisers use this feature for, nevertheless, it seemed interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-11-stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/ads-moments.gif" alt="The Moments feature on the Ads console"></p>

<p>Looking at the proxy logs, every time I “marked a moment”, a <code>POST</code> request was made to a <code>/GetThumbnails</code> endpoint, with a body which included a video ID:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/aw_video/_/rpc/VideoMomentService/GetThumbnails</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ads.google.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>Internet-Explorer-6</span>
<span>Cookie</span><span>:</span> <span>[redacted]</span>

__ar={"1":"kCTeqs1F4ME","2":"12240","3":"387719230"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where in the <code>__ar</code> parameter, <code>1</code> was the ID of the video and <code>2</code> was the time of the moment in milliseconds. The response was a base64 encoded image, which was the thumbnail displayed by Ads.</p>

<p>I did what I did a bunch of times already, and replaced the ID to my second account’s <code>Private</code> video in the request, and to my surprise, <strong>it returned a base64 response</strong>!</p>

<p>I quickly Googled “base64 to image”, and pasted the base64 into the first decoder I found, and it <strong>displayed a thumbnail from the target <code>Private</code> video</strong>! It worked! I have found a working IDOR <em>(Insecure Direct Object Reference)</em> bug, where I could get a frame from any private video on YouTube!</p>

<p>But I was like “hm, that is just one frame”. We can do better.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a proof of concept Python script which generates an actual, moving “video”. I searched for some calculations, and figured out that if the video is in 24 FPS, one frame stays on the screen for <code>33</code> milliseconds. So I just have to download every image starting from <code>0</code> milliseconds, incrementing by <code>33</code> milliseconds every time, and then construct some kind of video using all of the images I have acquired.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick and dirty POC which downloaded the frames for the first 3 seconds of a video, decoded them, and then generated a GIF. To test it, I have ran it against an old video of mine, which I had previously privated due to, of course, the <em>high level of cringe</em>:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="315px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3bNbYRTxZM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And there you have it, using this bug, any private YouTube video could have been downloaded by a malicious attacker, which to me feels like a pretty cool impact. But of course, it had a few limitations I couldn’t overcome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the real world you would have to know the ID of the target video. Mass-leaking those would be considered a bug on its own.</li>
  <li>Since these are just images, you can’t access audio.</li>
  <li>The resolution is very low. (but it’s high enough to see what is happening)</li>
</ul>

<p>The takeaway from this bug is that situations where two different products interact with each other under the hood are always a good area to focus on, since both product teams probably only know their own systems best, and might miss important details when working with a different product’s resources.</p>

<p>Looking for an IDOR like this can be a very repetitive and manual task, and nowadays I try to avoid just blindly changing IDs everywhere and hoping for the best. After you test a product for a while and get a feel of how it works internally, it might be more effective (and more fun) to try to think about different unexpected actions that the developers maybe didn’t think about based on what you saw already, or focus on features that just got released, or to just do any other non-mindless task. You will probably enjoy it more in the long term. In my opinion, the more you understand a system, the more ideas about how to break it will just naturally come to mind.</p>

<p>But again, even in the most robust and well tested systems, there is the chance that just swapping an ID in a request will get you a critical bug.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! See you <a href="https://twitter.com/xdavidhu" target="_blank">next Monday</a> ;)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h6><em>GraphQL Logo. Source: Facebook, BSD &lt;</em><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"><em>http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</em></a><em>&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons</em></h6><p>‍</p><p>At Genie AI, we deliver high quality user experience to our customers by constantly improving both our product and the way we work. We also believe in learning from each other. That's why we're sharing the steps we took and the lessons we learned to improve our GraphQL development workflow.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is GraphQL?</strong></p><p>GraphQL is a data query and language mutation that aims to improve the way a backend exposes its data to a client (frontend or mobile app). It’s now widely used across small to enterprise organisations because of its nature: it's both easy to adapt and easy to scale depending on the project maturity level. There's plenty of online resources discussing GraphQL and the benefits that have come from its adoption, but in this article we want to share a more specific point of view: how we found best practice in improving our GraphQL workflow efficiency.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Why improve a GraphQL workflow?</strong></p><p>As developers, when we first look at new technology, we more often than not are attracted to the benefits this technology will introduce, and we often forget to consider how we adapt and change our process to maximise those benefits. At the same time, if you ask developers if they're happy with a slow development process, no one ever says yes!</p><p>So what does this all mean?</p><p>It means adopting GraphQL is only one part of the job. The other is fine-tuning the development workflow to make it “efficient”. For us, GraphQL is a critical part of our stack, and we've found that a regular audit and refactor of our GraphQL process has had a positive impact on our development process.</p><p>Here's what we've learned:</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>1. Define input params with Parameter Object pattern</strong></h3><p>While defining GraphQL queries and mutations in the schema, it's pretty common to have several input arguments. Let’s consider this example we had in our schema:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-6fbe8d5a30c0-51ca6ca6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ebbcbea4c4c4875e541ff76/5ff73e6f7e302b639a3172cb_addDocument(name-String!).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Though our project did grow, we found ourselves in a situation where the number of signature arguments increased in an exponential way. This caused compromises in the code readability across the team and also made it hard to later refractory this code:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-f6c49e9da521-51ca6ca6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ebbcbea4c4c4875e541ff76/5ff73e8c5889a420ab4c9412_addDocument%202.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our solution was to opt-in to the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ParameterObject">Parameter Object pattern</a>, which aims to replace a list of arguments with an object containing these arguments.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fa8a7021edd7-51ca6ca6"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ebbcbea4c4c4875e541ff76/5ff73e9b5e60adc0891d0910_addDocument%203.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Having this in place simplified the query and mutation readability, as well as the way we consumed it on the frontend.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Give consistent response types with good error-handling support</strong></h3><p>Since GraphQL aims to improve the way data is consumed, it's also important to define a common, predictable way the results are returned.</p><p>Inspired by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807">RFC7807</a>, we created an envelope that consistently returns results and error messages in a way that is easily understood by our frontend developers. &nbsp;We also plan to use GraphQL Union to define different views of the error depending on conditions.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>3. Use batch requests over a custom GraphQL query</strong></h3><p>During the user interface build, you might find you need different data to exist in the frontend at specific times.</p><p>We faced this issue, and our initial approach was to create a custom query / resolver that internally aggregated many other GraphQL queries. &nbsp;Though this approach worked, we found that a major downside was that frontend developers may have to wait until the backend implementation is complete. We also found that, for backend developers, there may be a need to add a new testsuite scenario before delivery of the code.</p><p>Our current approach relies on GraphQL Batch operations, where the client (frontend) builds its own (batch) query that is sent to the backend. The results are returned back to the client in a shape defined by the frontend developer. We've found this is a very beneficial approach, as it allows GraphQL to use the fundamentals of compositional programming. Indeed, we were able to build a new function by composing multiple other functions already existing in the backend (and already tested).</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>4. Take advantage of the GraphQL Code Generator tools</strong></h3><p>Few developers are aware that GraphQL came with powerful code generator tools.</p><p>In our initial frontend GraphQL implementation the developer was in charge of defining query and fragment in order to consume a GraphQL query or mutation. This worked fine, until we had to deal with multiple queries and mutations, as well as code refractory. &nbsp;We quickly realised too much time was spent writing this code and we looked for a solution to automate it.</p><p>Luckily, the GraphQL code generator saved us. This tool came as a very user-friendly CLI generating ready to use query/mutation/fragment for different languages. In our case we are now able to generate all TypeScript queries and mutations with their own fragments automatically. This generated code is then used from our backend-testsuite and validated with a contract-testing strategy against our backend. This makes sure that the code is bug-free at the moment the frontend developer will use it.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>GraphQL is a relatively young technology that had a huge impact on many company in just a fews years. I’m expecting to see more and more changes to land in GraphQL specification very soon, as well as in ApolloServer and ApolloClient. Because of this it’s essential to have regular audits looking at how a team uses GraphQL so as to empower developers to improve not only our own work but also the way we work.</p><p>Put simply, we want to stop using old methodology with new technology.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 2: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 2: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Do you get anxious when installing/authorizing software? That feeling keeps you to ‘the beaten path’ which exacerbates inequality and amplifies monopolistic power.  Here I explain the underlying economic mechanisms that have turned the modern internet into a battlefield... </p>
<p>Internet software distribution has a huge design flaw, you cannot <em>see</em> what you are buying. You cannot see <em>how</em> your data is processed. You cannot <em>verify</em> the software does what it says it does. In many cases it does not.</p>
<p>For example, your internet service provider, <em>that you pay money to provide you with internet</em>, probably also sells your surfing data, in a free market, to anybody. Nobody would willingly choose that package! </p>
<p>Similarly, apps in the app store advertise doing one thing, whilst hoovering up data to sell to data brokers. If given a choice, you would pick the app that does not do that, but you can’t. You cannot observe how software is going to behave post purchase. </p>
<p>The software market is stuffed with software that advertises doing one thing, but behind your back, also does several other things that are against your best interests. This is why we are anxious. The internet, on aggregate, is actively hostile. Why has this happened?</p>
<p>George Akerlof won a Nobel prize for observing that when providers are more informed than the buyers a “market-for-lemons” forms. The market malfunctions by rewarding sleazy and deceptive practices. This is where we are today on the internet. </p>
<p>When buyers cannot assess the quality of a product directly, they use different buying signals. For software, this is often brand reputation. Established companies are incentivised to play by the rules, as their protection of the brand itself becomes worthwhile.</p>
<p>But this encourages winner-takes-all market dynamics. So we end up with just a handful of household brand technology companies (the FAANGs) whose individual opinions dominate the global narrative. This is not a healthy market for diversity. </p>
<p>We need to amplify the smaller good guys whilst avoiding the bad guys. Remember: this whole mess is because software buyers cannot assess the quality of the software they are purchasing.  My investment hypothesis is if we fix this, we fix the market.</p>
<p>So my goal is to improve software service observability. Imagine if end users could view the source code in a continuously publicly auditable system. It would take one motivated technical user to inoculate all the non-technical users against hostile service providers</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Over the weekend I was receiving some unusual emails from some cryptocurrency payment processors. Ones that I’ve never heard of let alone used. At first, I thought they were spam or phishing emails so I just ignored them. However, when BTC prices started rising the occurrence of emails also started to be more frequent.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/recovery_email_screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>More frequent emails about BTC payment processors.</em></p>
<p>As emails piled up I started to get more suspicious that this wasn’t a scam and someone was actually trying to recover their password. Inspecting the email headers I realized that I was receiving catch-all emails from a parked domain that I recently bought. Apparently the previous owner used the domain as his primary email when he signed up for those accounts. So right now the previous owner has forgotten their password and is attempting to recover their account. But there is one problem. They no longer own the domain, I do. There was no way for me to contact the previous owner and offer my help.</p>
<p>The next obvious course of action for me to was to see if I can actually change the password and essentially gain control to these accounts. If the previous owner actually knew the password, he/she would have changed the default email address by now. So it’s a fair assumption that any account still linked to my domain is long forgotten. So one by one I went and requested a password reset for the most popular cryptocurrency websites.</p>
<h2 id="service-1">Service #1</h2>
<p>I started with CoinPayments because it was the lowest hanging fruit due to the fact that I was still receiving emails from them. I expected this to fail because I had no knowledge about the previous owner, not even his/her name. To my surprise it was too easy. I was able to request a password reset and got an email to update my password in less than a minute. But as soon as I tried to log in I was face with a 2fa challenge.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/2fa_coinpayments.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>2 Factor Authentication Challenge for CoinPayments</em></p>
<p>This was not a challenge because after all, I do own the email. After waiting for the 2fa code to arrive I was able to login and had full control of the account. I quickly tried to see how much BTC it had and was disappointed to see that it had none.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinpayments_zero_balance.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>CoinPayments BTC wallet with zero BTC.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinpayments_recent_transaction.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>CoinPayments Recent Transaction</em></p>
<p>The transaction history showed that the last withdraw was in 2016 September 26. So this account has been inactive for a long time. I doubt the previous owner still remember anything about it.</p>
<h2 id="service-2">Service #2</h2>
<p>I moved on to the next website which was Coinsplit. Again the process was simple and I was able to gain control of the account within seconds of trying. This time there was no 2fa challenge and the balance was even more disappointing, it was actually negative.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinsplit_balance_negative.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Coinsplit Negative Balance</em></p>
<h2 id="service-3">Service #3</h2>
<p>For my third trick, I decided to try Confirmo. And you’ve guessed it. Recovering and gaining control of this account wasn’t hard at all. The only difference this time was that this account actually has some leftover BTC that hadn’t been withdrawn yet. At the time of writing BTC was worth $38k and Confirmo account had about $1k worth of BTC.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_screenshot_balance.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Confirmo Account with $1k worth of BTC at the time of writing.</em></p>
<p>Bingo! Now things got interesting. Now I’m faced with two choices. <strong>One I can leave the account alone and let the BTC get deleted and forgotten or I can try and withdraw the funds.</strong> I didn’t like option one because it would be a waste, and I really wanted to see how hard it would be to withdraw these funds. So I decided to create an empty wallet and try and withdraw the funds.</p>
<p>My first challenge was trying to add a withdraw address. Which required a physical address and a BTC address. I made up the physical address and used one of the BTC from the wallet I just generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_settlement_method_edit.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Updating Confirmo settlement method</em></p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_2fa_saving_settlement_changes.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>2fa Challenge for updating Confirmo settlement changes</em></p>
<p>There were some security measures of course. Before I can save the changes it required me to pass a 2fa. Again, because I own the email I had no issues getting pass this little challenge. And just like that I was able to add my own BTC address to the settlement account. Now I just have to sit back and wait for the funds to arrive.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/changed_the_payout_address.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Added my own BTC address to the settlement account</em></p>
<h2 id="other-services">Other Services</h2>
<p>I also looked at a couple more accounts. I was able to recover and login to all of them without any issues but they didn’t have any left over BTC. I don’t think 2fa was serious enough back in 2016 for this person to secure his/her account. So I do not blame them for not having their account properly secured with a 2fa outside of their primary email. None of the services are to blame either. They all had the user’s interest in mind and most of them actually tried to stop me by requiring me to verify my email. The only downside is if a malicious person has access to the email they pretty much have everything they need to wreak havoc. There really isn’t a good mechanism from protecting the user’s account.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-account">How To Protect Your Account?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for accounts using a email address that you <strong>can control forever</strong>. Maybe a free service like Gmail isn’t bad after all.</li>
<li>Always user 2fa outside of your email. If they control one they are still missing the second piece to do any harm.</li>
<li>Use a password manager. It would be hard for me to guess every service that the previous owner used. This only pop up on my radar because he/she tried to recover the account password.</li>
<li>Email is very powerful. Make sure you protect it properly. I often hear people say their phone is their life. I opt to say say my email is my life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-the-btc">Will I keep the BTC?</h2>
<p>My plan is to try to give back the BTC to the original owner, but my only problem is I have no way of finding out who they are. That is why I need your help. I will encrypt the Electrum wallet with a password in the format of <username><email address=""> so if the rightful owner knows the username and email address he will be able to unlock the wallet. I can only afford to spend ~$1k time and effort into trying to find the original owner before it becomes diminishing returns.</email></username></p>
<p>Someone suggested that I contact the services to get information on the previous owner. I doubt that this will work because when I logged on to the accounts I saw no names or address of the previous owner. I also doubt that the company will be willing to disclose such information to a random person on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/asking_previous_domain_owner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I contacted the previous domain owner, and he said he did not own any cryptocurrency assets. I’ve got one more person to ask before releasing the wallet for people to try to guess.</p>
<p>2021-12-01 After some research I’ve decided to not release the encrypted wallet. With a password format of <username>_<email> can be easily cracked. So instead I will hold on to the wallet until someone emails me at the <email> address and wants to claim it.</email></email></username></p>

<p>Tether has become a plain old fiat central bank, issuing new USDTs against debt. USDTs are backed, but not by US dollars. They are backed by promises to make good on their debts by the receivers of newly minted USDTs.</p>



<p>While it’s not fraudulent per se, the fact that USDTs aren’t backed by US dollars opens the door to unlimited USDT printing. The gatekeepers are the people in charge of the Tether printing press. In an ideal world, they should ensure that proper reserve requirements are met and that the receivers of newly minted USDTs are properly capitalised.</p>



<p>However, Bitcoin’s exponential price rise, happening in lockstep with ever-increasing USDT issuance, shows that the Tether press has gone in overdrive. When the mania will end, crypto investors will lose everything, in a second.</p>



<h2>The Tetheral Reserve</h2>



<p>Long gone are the days when Tether claimed that USDTs were backed by cash. Its own website states:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png 659w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not necessarily a bad thing for the crypto ecosystem that Tether doesn’t have cash on hand to the amount of USDTs issued. First off, that would be a central point of failure. Tether the institution is currently under investigation, USDTs are used for money laundering, and having $20 billion in a bank account would expose you to having your assets frozen – as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-files-for-subpoena-in-bid-to-recover-880-million-in-frozen-funds">already happened in the past</a>.</p>



<p>It’s much more practical to have all your assets in loans to counterparties, from a solvency and operational point of view. The problem is, of course, that is exposes you to:</p>



<h3>Liquidity risk</h3>



<p>The role of USDTs is to replace US dollars in the crypto ecosystem. USDTs are much easier to transfer, because you don’t have to deal with a bank that will ask you all sorts of questions about the origins of the funds, the purpose of the transfer, and the identity of the receiver. In short, you don’t have to bother with AML (“anti money laundering”), KYC (“know your client”), and capital controls regulations. In shorter, USDTs empower you to launder money.</p>



<p>But as much as USDTs are more practical than US dollars, their usage requires convertibility. We live in the real world where nobody accepts USDTs as payment, and you need to be able to cash out your USDTs for real money. You can do this by buying Bitcoin with USDTs on an exchange that trades the BTC/USDT pair, wiring them to an exchange that trades the BTC/USD pair, and cash out. Or, if you are a big player, you can go to a crypto OTC desk and sell your USDTs directly for cash:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-300x81.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-768x208.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>source: https://www.coindesk.com/tether-usdt-russia-china-importers</figcaption></figure>



<p>This act of financial hot potato, where someone else buys your USDTs, works for as long as the crypto bull run goes on. However, you need a backstop for when things go south, namely, when people suddenly stop wanting to acquire USDTs, and want to cash out for real money. Then, someone has to redeem the USDTs for cash, and that someone should be the issuer: Tether.</p>



<p>If Tether doesn’t have enough cash on hand to process redemption requests, you have a good old liquidity crunch, when panic sets in, and people start dumping their USDT holdings en masse, for whatever price of thing they can get in exchange. Much like a real world financial crisis.</p>



<h3>USDT redemptions?</h3>



<p>Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs for real money has been questioned over the last few years, not least because it seems that they’ve ever barely done it, as the number of USDTs outstanding never goes down:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png 946w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-300x104.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-768x266.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px"><figcaption>USDT market cap, source: coin360</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that the dip in October 2018 was due to Tether loaning $850m to Bitfinex, not actual redemptions.</p>



<p>Other reasons to question Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs are the fact that, well, a lot of people couldn’t get Tether to redeem them, despite Tether’s own assurances that proper mechanisms were in place. Moreover, Tether’s own handling of this “FUD” has been anecdotal and shady:</p>



<blockquote>— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1346101912677048320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>In the tweet above, the CTO of Tether shares “proof” that USDTs can be redeemed. However, the “proof” is just a list of USDT transactions to and from Bitfinex supposedly performed by an OTC desk, and without a matching set of USD transactions, it means nothing. The original question was, after all:</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If anyone…anywhere….has redeemed USDT for USD and can show proof of this transaction I would be happy to compensate you for your time and effort. Thanks! <a href="https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc">https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc</a></p>— Santiago Capital (@SantiagoAuFund) <a href="https://twitter.com/SantiagoAuFund/status/1345970353747578882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>Notice the “redeem <strong>for USD</strong>” part that gets ignored by Tether. Yup.</p>



<h2>The mother of all speculative manias</h2>



<p>Remember the real estate bubble of 2003-2007? How people who could barely pay their bills would buy five condos, see their price go up as other people would also buy five condos, and everyone would seemingly get rich out of thin air, together? The reasons for that bubble, in short, were lax lending requirements. A more complete explanation was that banks found ways (thanks to securitisation, reverse engineering credit rating agency rulebooks, and shadow banking) to issue mortgages to people who should have never, ever, qualified for those mortgages. As more mortgages were issued, housing prices went up, in a seemingly infinite loop.</p>



<h3>Infinite money</h3>



<p>Fiat money is issued against debt. I come into a bank, ask for $10,000, and the bank gives me the money in exchange of me acknowledging that I owe the bank $10,000 – plus interest.</p>



<p>Why can’t I come into a bank and ask for $10,000,000,000? Because banks have rules governing how much they can lend and to whom. The first rule is common sense: if customers aren’t able to repay their loans, the bank will go bust, and because the bank doesn’t want to go bust, it will only lend to people whom it deems creditworthy.</p>



<p>Other rules are regulatory. Banks must have adequate capital to absorb losses on their loan portfolio. It means that their assets must exceed their loans, and the riskier the loans, the larger that excess must be. Banks must also perform maturity matching – meaning that their sources of funding can’t be all short term, when they’re underwriting 30 year mortgages. Then there is risk weighting of assets, Basel II capital frameworks, etc., etc. Just look at this monstruosity:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg 577w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px"><figcaption>Banking is complicated<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many, many, many rules in place that are intended to prevent bubbles and manias. Despite the meme that “banks print fiat out of thin air”, they don’t – because of those rules. If they did, you’d have a new tulip bulb mania on every Thursday, and civilisation would collapse before summer.</p>



<h3>Infinite almost-money</h3>



<p>What rules are in place at Tether? What prevents them from printing USDTs out of thin air, without any rules? What prevents Binance from calling Tether and asking for 10,000,000,000 USDTs?</p>



<p>At first glance, the answer is: reality. Were Tether to issue too many USDTs, and start buying BTC and ETH and XRP with it, the price of USDT would get below $1. This has happened in the past, albeit for short periods of time.</p>



<p>But the USDT peg has remained exceptionally stable throughout 2020, despite the greatest financial and economic crisis in recent memory. Exchanges are maintaining the USDT peg, because their very existence depends on it. And USDT has replaced USD  in the crypto ecosystem, they cannot allow it to fail. They have USDT on their books. More importantly, their clients own USDT, and account for it as if it were real US dollars. Should USDT’s price fall, people would sell other cryptocurrencies as well, because they’d need to make up for the lost USDT liquidity – and the whole crypto ecosystem would collapse.</p>



<p>Remember, there is a very real need for USDTs, as long as they are pegged to the US dollar, and can be used for immediate, KYC and AML – free transactions.</p>



<p>The USDT/USD peg is founded on the premise that people won’t try to cash out en masse. As long as they don’t, USDT printing can continue.</p>



<h3>Creating value out of thin air</h3>



<p>Bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value. Seriously, it doesn’t. It has no use case (transactions don’t create sustainable demand – you buy Bitcoin, transact, and the other party sells it, a few minutes later), produces no cash flows, gives you no rights or claims. It’s always been a confidence game.</p>



<p>How do you create confidence?</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the higher demand is self-sustaining without manipulation then the manipulation actually bootstrapped genuine value. Maybe like an entrepreneur who aggressively exaggerates the state of development of a project and raises funds but then creates the product and justifies value</p>— Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/965744440303374342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2018</a></blockquote> 



<p>As long as things go up, and people don’t see any reason why they should stop, things will continue going up. Of course, people at large are unreliable, and they could stop thinking that things will continue going up, because there’s a huge economic crisis, for example. Then things go down very fast:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png 597w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s price crash during the COVID-19 rout in March 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had this selling been allowed to continue, there wouldn’t be a crypto ecosystem left to speak of, today. This is why Tether and the exchanges came together and crossed the Rubicon, and decided to create USDT liquidity to stop the selling, by minting a huge 1.6 BILLION USDTs on March 31, 2020, and distributing it across main exchanges.</p>



<p>And it worked. The Tetheral Reserve was born – an infinite pool of USDT liquidity, backed by the exchanges themselves, who committed to hold the USDT/USD peg, in order to save the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<h3>To infinity, and beyond</h3>



<p>Since that fateful day nine months ago, the Tether press has been picking up speed. As the price of Bitcoin increases, the confidence in the crypto ecosystem rises to new highs, and people don’t bother to question the exponential rise of USDTs outstanding. First of, because the mainstream media doesn’t talk about it – only about the rise of Bitcoin’s price. Then, because insiders themselves …</p></div></article></div>

<p id="Summary"><span><strong>Summary:</strong></span>
You can’t read a math book the way you read other books.
It takes a special approach to read math, not just pass your eyes over it.
You may need as long as half an hour to get through one page, but
you will understand it when you’re done.</p>

<p id="SeeAlso1"><span><strong>See&nbsp;also:</strong></span>
<a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/succeed.htm">How to Succeed in Math</a>
<br><a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/study.htm">How to Study Math</a></p>

<h2 id="TwoKinds">Two Kinds of Reading</h2>

<p>In
a Usenet article,
Chan-Ho Suh neatly summed up
the “two kinds of understanding a math text. The first is in being
able to follow, reconstruct, etc. a proof [or solution method].  The
second lies in rewiring one’s brain so that it’s obvious why the
theorem is true” or why the solution works. “Contrary to impressions
you may have garnered from your math courses, the first kind of
understanding is not the primary goal, ... but the second kind
definitely is.”</p>

<h2 id="No">What Not to Do</h2>

<p><strong>Don’t memorize too much.</strong> Many students try to commit
everything to memory. Math doesn’t work like that: you are learning
methods of problem solving. If you treat the material like a mass of
unrelated facts, it will be a big jumble in your head and you’ll very
naturally feel frustrated.</p>

<p>True, there are a few formulas you’ll need to have available. Write
them down on <em>one</em> “cheat sheet”. Look at them in odd moments and
practice saying them over to yourself. Then write 
<span id="U20140922a">them</span> down 
<a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/test.htm#BrainDump">at the start of any test</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Don’t start with the homework problems.</strong> The assigned
problems are not “the homework”. They’re the last part of the
homework. The first part is reading and understanding today’s section
of the textbook.</p>
<p>Most students can’t just listen to the lecture and then
immediately solve the homework problems. The textbook is there to
reinforce your understanding of what was covered in class and to
explain points the lecture didn’t have time to cover.</p>


<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to go back.</strong> Math is relentlessly
cumulative. If you don’t understand something in today’s lesson,
perhaps it’s because you didn’t really understand something in an
earlier lesson, or you’ve forgotten it. Go back and re-learn that
earlier material.</p>
<p>Granted, it can be discouraging to go back to an earlier section
of the book. But you are not moving backward. You’re still making
progress because you’re strengthening your understanding of that
earlier concept.</p>



<h2 id="Yes">What to Do</h2>

<p><strong>First skim for an overview.</strong> Nobody understands
something complex on first reading: about all you can hope to do is
get a general sense of what it’s about and perhaps one or two of the
main points of the argument. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong
with you; it’s how almost everyone’s mind works. That first reading
just lays the framework for you to fill in later with details.</p>


<p><strong>Then reread with concentration.</strong> Read slower this time.
Highlight important points for further study. (Don’t overdo
the highlighting. Distinguish key points and highlight them; that
should be well under 50% of the text. Color-code if that helps you.)</p>
<p>Some students find it helpful to take notes on separate paper while
reading. If you’ve never done this, you might want to give it a try.
You may find that it helps focus your mind and fit the concepts
together better.</p>


<p><strong>Go through each step of each example.</strong> Don’t read; write.
Many examples have some steps left out; you should write down a
complete solution with all steps. Make sure you understand how the
book gets from each step to the next step.</p>
<p>This is where many students shortchange themselves. There’s a huge
tendency to hit an example and have the eyes just jump to the next bit
of English. But remember that <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/whyhard.htm">you learn math by
doing</a>, not by reading. You need to work each example to understand
the concept.</p>


<p><strong>Fill in any gaps.</strong> If there are still any words or
concepts you don’t understand, go back to the book and learn them. If
you need to, put them on the list to talk over with your study buddy
or with a <a href="http://www.tc3.edu/bcl/">Baker Center</a> tutor,
or see your instructor outside of class if s/he’s available.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, get those problems cleared up before the next
class so that they don’t interfere with your understanding that
lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Think about what you’ve read.</strong> Fit it in with what
you already know. Is this a more general version of a specific case you
learned earlier? Is this a shorter method for something you previously
learned to do a longer way? Does this use something you learned
previously that looked useless at the time?</p>

<p><strong>Make it your own.</strong> Can you explain this to someone
else? (This is where a <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/study.htm#Group">study group</a>
really shines.) If there’s no one else available, can you explain it
aloud, without stumbling? If you can do that, you probably understand
it. Don’t shortchange yourself here! “I sort of get it” means you
need to go over it again (but maybe after a break).</p>

<p id="Chunks"><strong>Divide and conquer.</strong> If you have a whole chapter
to learn, master one section at a time. Try to spread your work evenly
over the available time.</p>

<p><strong>Do the homework problems.</strong> If you don’t understand how to
do one, look back in the book for a similar problem. Don’t just push
numbers at it; make sure you understand the example and see how to
apply it.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/prob.htm">separate page</a> gives some suggestions for
working story problems.</p>

High water demand, a growing population and a dry climate has helped lead to the trading of private water rights in the state.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Robert Galbraith/File Photo/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Water remains big business. The URL for the upcoming Global Water Summit scheduled this spring in Madrid — with <u><a href="https://www.watermeetsmoney.com/agenda-day-1/" target="_blank">an agenda that includes</a></u> some of the world's biggest water producers and consumers — is watermeetsmoney.com.</p>  <p>But the idea of water as something to be bought and sold by Wall Street speculators does not necessarily sit well with those who study the economics of this resource in Canada.</p>  <p>"I find it quite disturbing," said Jim Warren, Regina-based scholar and author of <em><u><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Defying-Palliser-Resilience-Canadian-Prairies/dp/0889772940" target="_blank">Defying Palliser: Stories of Resilience from the Driest Region of the Canadian Prairies</a></u></em>. "I mean it's upsetting, especially since, you know, the world will be watching and others will be thinking it's the way to go."</p>  <p>Water has always been seen by economists as a special case. Like the air we breathe, it is more valuable to human life than gold or oil or even, in the short term, food. But because of its relative abundance, water's traditional price in Canada has been close to zero.</p>  <h2>Private deals at the curling rink</h2>  <p>In the driest parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, Warren said there are signs that may be changing. He points to events around the year 2000, when Alberta and Saskatchewan were suffering a serious drought and communities and their industrial users were running out of water in the Lethbridge area.</p>  <p>Warren said that under an implied threat from the provincial government, and for a financial consideration, irrigation associations of farmers who had allocations of water&nbsp;cut back on their use by about a third. Many of them made&nbsp;up the difference with more efficient irrigation techniques.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, individual farmers who had allocations of their own made private deals with neighbours to share some of their water.</p>  <p>"It wasn't as if there were public auctions<strong>,</strong>"&nbsp;said Warren. "At the curling rinks and coffee shops, you sort of figured out what it might be worth to sell some of what [you] had to others."</p>  <p>But the situation demonstrated&nbsp;how water was already being commodified.</p>  <p>Because of the limited supply of water, only a small fraction of land in Alberta and Saskatchewan is irrigated. But normally when land is sold, the water allocation necessary to farm the higher-value crops on that land goes with it, which in many ways appears to be an evolution toward private water rights of the kind that have emerged in California.</p>  <p>As a provincial resource under the constitution, there is no single set of rules for water use in Canada.&nbsp;However, the general rule is that water cannot be bought or owned. Instead, it is allocated by provincial regulation.</p>  <h2>We're 'not paying the value' of water</h2>  <p>But as Diane Dupont, a long-time water economist at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., points out, in most cases, the water itself costs nothing for municipal and large industrial users, and that creates problems of its own.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/g8-canada-protests.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/g8-canada-protests.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/g8-canada-protests.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/g8-canada-protests.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/g8-canada-protests.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866653.1610136583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/g8-canada-protests.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>During the G8 summit in 2010, demonstrators in Huntsville, Ont., declared water a human right. But water economists say it must also have a price to avoid wasteful consumption.<!-- --> <!-- -->(REUTERS)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"Typically, they're paying a very low fee," said Dupont, author of <em><u><a href="https://cwn-rce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BEI-water-asset-report-EN-web.pdf" target="_blank">Running Through Our Fingers: How Canada Fails to Capture the Value of its Top Asset</a></u></em>. "They're not paying the value of the water."</p>    <p>Despite the apparent abundance of water in Canada, she said, low prices mean the best-quality water in many regions — such as Southern Ontario groundwater — is in increasingly short supply and is being overused.</p>  <p>Roy Brouwer, executive director of the <u><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/water-institute/" target="_blank">Water Institute</a></u> at the University of Waterloo, said that when he came to Canada from the Netherlands five years ago, he was surprised by the low price and wasteful misuse of water in this country.</p>  <p>Water users simply don't pay the full cost, he told me, and introducing various sorts of market price systems might fix that.</p>  <p>Of course, in the past, leaving speculators in charge of the price of essential goods — such as when Enron helped bid up the price of gas and electricity in the early 2000s — has sometimes worked out badly for end users.</p>  <p>"If you leave it completely to the market, you might end up with some of these extreme situations," said Brouwer. "Somewhere in between considering water a human right and the commodification of water through these water markets is probably where you want to be."</p>  <p>Follow Don on Twitter <u><a href="https://twitter.com/don_pittis" target="_blank">@don_pittis</a></u></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We know what personal goals are but why do we need to set them? Isn’t it enough to have them floating around our heads? Experts say, definitely not! Setting goals sets your mind up for success. Making your goals explicit helps to focus your attention, time, and behavior towards achieving them. You will fail to achieve 100% of the goals you never set. And the very act of writing them down could make all the difference. </p><p>In fact, <a href="https://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=news-releases">a study in 2015 by psychologist Gail Matthews</a> revealed that simply writing down goals increased the chances of achieving them by 33 percent compared to having goals that stayed locked inside one’s head. Can your life be purposeful, meaningful, and good without goal setting? Of course it can! But, you have a much greater chance of designing the life you <em>really</em> want by explicitly setting personal goals. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

Many experts recommend setting something called SMART goals. SMART is a mnemonic device that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound. </p><ul><li><strong>S: Specific: </strong>Instead of setting a goal to “become wealthy” set a specific goal to “have $1 million invested in a mutual fund by the age of 50.”</li><li><strong>M: Measurable:</strong> The goal should be conducive to metrics. What would it look like to make progress and to fully achieve the goal?</li><li><strong>A: Attainable:</strong> Your goals should be big, but realistic.

His book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-to-Last-Jim-Collins-audiobook/dp/B0813QCVN9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=built+to+last&amp;qid=1601575446&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Built to Last</em></a> was a follow up to the groundbreaking, and now classic, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=good+to+great&amp;qid=1601575412&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Good to Great</em></a>. In it, he and co author Jerry I. Porras introduced a concept that is now widely applied in corporate goal setting. It’s called a <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html">BHAG</a>, pronounced bee-hag. </p><p>BHAG stands for Big Hairy Audacious Goal and it challenges corporations and organizations to set their sights on a super large, awe inspiring, borderline outlandish goal that will be the guidepost for decision making within the organization. The writer’s use President Kennedy’s moon landing proclamation as a prime example of a BHAG. </p><p>The author’s wrote, “Like the moon mission, a true BHAG is clear and compelling and serves as a unifying focal point of effort– often creating immense team spirit. &nbsp;It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for finish lines. &nbsp;A BHAG engages people– it reaches out and grabs them in the gut. &nbsp;It is tangible, energizing, highly focused. &nbsp;People "get it" right away; it takes little or no explanation.”</p><p>There is no reason why BHAG success should be limited to businesses. That’s why we recommend starting by setting a BHAG for yourself. Think of one huge “clear and compelling” star of a dream goal that you can hook all of your efforts and focus onto. Shoot for the stars! Dream big. Make it “audacious.” Above all else, make it <em>yours</em> alone. Every personal BHAG will be unique, but here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Retire debt free in Costa Rica.</li><li>Become a self-made millionaire.</li><li>Sell my business for enough to set up six-figure trusts for my children.</li><li>Finish in the top ten at the Boston Marathon.</li><li>Compete in three Olympic Games.</li><li>Publish a book that hits the New York Times bestseller list.</li><li>Own a ranch that houses a non-profit animal sanctuary for big cats. </li></ul><p>Write your BHAG down in private and highly visible places. Look at it often. Tell people about it and expect wide-eyed feedback. Your big goal should incite a riot of reactions. If it doesn’t, it may not be big, hairy, or audacious enough. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now that you have one giant goal to rule them all, you are ready to go to step two. It’s time to set a series of increasingly smaller goals that lead to the big one. Think of your BHAG as the final destination. Along the way, you have to cross a series of obstacles. These smaller goals will be the roads, stepping stones, or trails you will take and the tools and skills you will acquire that are necessary to get all the way there.</p><p>In her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Goal-Guide-Planning-Achieving-ebook/dp/B07T3GZX1S/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=your+goal+guide&amp;qid=1601577717&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFMWTdDQ1c5SjAyNDMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NTI1ODExUkxDMTAxUkJFVkRSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MzU0Njg5NjBMUTg2UTFNR00md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl"><em>Your Goal Guide</em></a>, author and goal-setting coach Debra Eckerling lays out a highly detailed plan for breaking a big ultimate goal into smaller goals that will keep you on the path to what she calls “GoalTopia.” She recommends that you first determine the long-term goals you will need to achieve in order to reach your final destination. Under each of those long term goals, you will list benchmarks or hurdles that you will need to clear to achieve those long-term goals. Under those benchmarks or hurdles, you will list tasks you need to take care of to clear the hurdles. </p><p>Let’s look at the debt-free retirement in Costa Rica for example. One long term goal might be to pay off an existing mortgage in fifteen years. Under that, you need a list of increasingly smaller goals that may look something like this:</p><p><strong>The Big Goal: Retire debt free in Costa Rica</strong></p><ol><li>Pay off the existing mortgage in fifteen years.</li><li>Make two payments per month equal to twice the required payment.</li><li>Create and stick to a monthly budget.</li><li>Eliminate credit card debt.</li><li>Pay off the car loan. </li></ol><p>Outlines, lists, diagrams, funnels, using <a href="https://doit.io/why-doit/">a digital tool like doit</a>, filling in a goal worksheet: the format you use is entirely up to you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org778b42a">
<p>
So far we've been using <code>play</code> to make sounds. Another more involved and flexible way of working is by first defining audio processes with <code>defsynth</code>. Then they'll silently live on the server until instantiated by <code>synth</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(defsynth tone ((freq 440) (amp 0.2))
  (out.ar 0 (saw.ar freq amp)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In the example above, we define a synth named <code>tone</code>, and give it two parameters, <code>amp</code> and <code>freq</code>, each with a default value (respectively 1 and 440).
</p>
<p>
Next comes a body of expressions. If we want to hear the sounds that our synth will produce, and unlike previously, now we have to use a new UGen, <code>out</code>, to send the signal to an output bus. Buses will dealt with later, but for now it suffices to note that SuperCollider reserves the bus indexes starting with 0 to the hardware output channels. Our left channel is 0, and the right channel is 1. The first argument to <code>out.ar</code> is the index of the bus that we want to write toâ€”in this case it's 0, the left channel.
</p>
<p>
Finally the signal chain has only one UGen, <code>saw.ar</code>, a sawtooth wave generator, called with the parameters that we defined before.
</p>
<p>
The above code, however, won't play any sound. Upon evaluating the synth definition, it will be constructed on the server, and silently live there until instantiated. To do so, we need:
</p>

<p><audio controls="controls" id="org9d8c4ad">
<source src="https://nunotrocado.com/assets/cl-collider-tutorial/440hz-saw.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
<p>
Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</p>
</audio></p><p>
When we have enough:
</p>

<p>
We can also store the resulting node on a variable, <code>*tone*</code>, and <code>free</code> it later. Also, we can provide values for the synth's parameters, like so:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(<span>defparameter</span> <span>*tone*</span>
  (synth 'tone
         <span>:freq</span> (midicps 42)
         <span>:amp</span> 0.3))


(free *tone*)
</pre>
</div>
<p><audio controls="controls" id="orgaa7e443">
<source src="https://nunotrocado.com/assets/cl-collider-tutorial/fs2-saw.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
<p>
Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</p>
</audio></p><p>
Beyond freeing, this also allows us to change the synth's parameters while it's playing, through <code>ctrl</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(ctrl *tone* <span>:freq</span> (midicps 48))
</pre>
</div>
<p><audio controls="controls" id="orgf7726eb">
<source src="https://nunotrocado.com/assets/cl-collider-tutorial/saw-note-change.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
<p>
Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</p>
</audio></p><p>
Note that what <code>play</code> was doing behind the scenes was essentially defining a temporary synth and running it.
</p>
<p>
If the signal chain consists of multiple channels, the bus index provided to <code>out.ar</code> is the first one, and the others are mapped to successive indexes. The next version of our synth plays slightly detuned sawtooth waves in the left and right channels.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(defsynth tone ((freq 440) (amp 0.2))
  (out.ar 0 (saw.ar (<span>let</span> ((detune (* freq 0.01)))
                      (list (- freq detune) (+ freq detune)))
                    (/ amp 2))))

(<span>let</span> ((node (synth 'tone)))
  (sleep 2)
  (free node))

In the above code, we used <code>sleep</code> and then <code>free</code> to stop the synth automatically after two seconds. But there must be a better way, and of course there is oneâ€”/envelopes/.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(defsynth tone ((freq 440) (amp 0.2))
  (out.ar 0 (* (saw.ar (<span>let</span> ((detune (* freq 0.01)))
                         (list (- freq detune) (+ freq detune))))
               (env-gen.kr (perc 0.1 1.8)
                           <span>:level-scale</span> amp
                           <span>:act</span> <span>:free</span>))))

(synth 'tone)
</pre>
</div>

In the example above, a sawtooth generator (<code>saw</code>) produces the audible sound, which is multiplied by the envelope generator <code>env-gen</code>, in order to dynamically control its amplitude. The first argument of <code>env-gen</code> defines the envelope itself. For convenience, some frequently used envelope shapes are already predefined, among them <code>perc</code> (for "percussive"), here called with an attack time of 0.1 seconds and a release time of 1.8 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Since we have an amplitude envelope, it's seems appropriate that <code>amp</code> is moved to its keyword argument <code>level-scale</code>.
</p>
<p>
The final keyword argument, <code>act</code>, controls what happens when the envelope is finished playing. In this case, it will <code>free</code> the synth automatically. If we hadn't done this, and even though the synth is now silent, because the envelope ran its course completely, the corresponding node would still be kept on the server. But we don't want to waste the server's resources, and therefore it's a good practice to free what we don't plan to keep using.
</p>
<p>
Now let's look at a more involved example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(defsynth tone ((freq 440) (amp 0.2) (gate 1))
  (out.ar 0
          (* (rlpf.ar (+ (saw.ar (<span>let</span> ((detune (* freq 0.01)))
                                   (list (- freq detune)
                                         (+ freq detune))))
                         (* (brown-noise.ar)
                            (env-gen.kr (asr 1.5 0.175 0)
                                        <span>:gate</span> gate)))
                      (env-gen.kr (env '(80 2400 200 2400)
                                       '(0.05 0.2 5))))
             (env-gen.kr (adsr 0.05 0.4 0.4 1.2)
                         <span>:gate</span> gate
                         <span>:level-scale</span> amp
                         <span>:act</span> <span>:free</span>))))

(<span>defparameter</span> <span>*tone*</span>
  (synth 'tone
         <span>:freq</span> (midicps 42)))
</pre>
</div>
<p><audio controls="controls" id="org21454e7">
<source src="https://nunotrocado.com/assets/cl-collider-tutorial/tone-more-envs.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

</audio></p><p>
This shows other envelope recipes. Instead of <code>perc</code>, the volume envelope is now defined with <code>adsr</code>, which follows the standard shape of attack (0.05), decay (0.4), sustain level (0.4), and release (1.2). Since we now have a sustain segment, we also need to tell the envelope when to leave the sustain segment and proceed to the release one. We use <code>gate</code> for that. When <code>gate</code> is 1 (or any value above 0) the envelope starts, and it is held open until <code>gate</code> is set to 0, moving the envelope to the release portion. Also, <code>gate</code> is now a also a synth parameter, with 1 as a default value, so the envelope triggers as soon as the synth is instantiated, but it's possible to later instruct the running synth to change this value to 0.
</p>
<p>
Our synth now also has a resonant low pass filter (<code>rlpf</code>), whose frequency is modulated by an envelope. We use <code>env</code> to define the envelope. <code>env</code> is the basic specification for envelopes. First, we give it a list of levels, then a list of times (optionally also a list of curves, not used in the example). So the envelope starts at level 80, takes 0.05 seconds to increase to level 2400, then takes 0.2 seconds to move down to level 200, and finally takes 5 seconds to move back up to 2400, holding the last value indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new sound source: a brown noise generator. The amount of noise that gets mixed in with the sawtooth oscillator is controlled with an <code>asr</code> envelope, that has three segments: attack, sustain, and release.
</p>
<p>
To trigger the release portion of the envelopes, and ultimately stop the sound, we change the gate to 0:
</p>

<p>
The next example uses our synth and its gated envelopes together with <code>sleep</code> as a crude way of sequencing notes, in this case a kind of spectral arpeggio. To avoid blocking the main thread while this is playing, we move the synth logic to a function and create a new thread to run it.

January 11, 2021 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2021/streaming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2021/streaming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>A few months ago I got a feeling that I’d enjoy live streaming some coding. Not sure exactly, but it seemed to be somewhere along the lines of “sitting at home,” “not enough people around to complain to” and things like that. Plus it felt like it could spark some interesting discussions. Maybe. Also, this creates some time-based pressure to do smaller projects — because you’re doing that every Wednesday (or whenever). And doing small things outside of general job-related stuff makes me feel like a person with wider interests. Who am I kidding though, it’s all programming.</p>
<p>The issue here is that I can’t just start doing something suddenly. I can’t just buy a dishwashing machine  — I need to read up on what are the current features and trends and qualities and select the one I like. It’s the same with streaming  — I can’t stream using Macbook cam even though I’m going to sit in a little sector of a video. I need a better webcam so I can feel like it’s for real! So I set to research the topic.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>And it turns out <a href="https://vsevolod.net/good-webcams/">you can’t buy a good webcam</a>. They are all shit — even if you pay $200+. If you want good picture quality the only way right now is to buy a photo camera with an HDMI capture card. All major brands have released drivers to connect cameras via USB, but those drivers are unanimously bad: USB2 can support compressed 1080p60, but those drivers only support 576p30. What is this madness I don’t know, so you have to use an HDMI capture card.</p>
<p>The capture card could either be some <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/4000917130635.html">cheap thingie</a> for $15 from Aliexpress, or an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3FN5MR">Elgato Camlink 4K</a> for $130 (or other proper brand-name stuff for even more money). I settled on a cheap crap and it works fine for now: it doesn’t support 4K, and 1080p is also questionable, but the resulting video quality is miles ahead of webcams and phones.</p>
<p>For a camera you have two non-negotiable properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be able to work on AC power. Working on batteries and a charger is insanity when it’s a non-mobile working place.</li>
<li>It should output the so-called “clean HDMI”. This means that HDMI output should contain whatever the camera sees but without all the technical information, which is present on a camera screen — like a shutter speed or a battery level.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second one just out-ruled my otherwise excellent Fuji X-T1, because it outputs only recorded footage at the HDMI port. It was painful to realize, but I went to a local classified site and bought a used Sony a5100 for $250.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why a5100:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sony’s autofocus is the best on the market.</li>
<li>The sensor is good enough. I looked at <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/sony-a5100-sensor-review-uncompromising-performance/">dxomark</a> results and they are almost the same as much newer a6400 and a6600 have.</li>
<li>It has a flip-out screen that flips up 180° (sticking from the top of the camera). Excellent as a self-monitor, because it will work even if some of the components in the path fail.</li>
<li>It’s dirt cheap. It’s an older model made for 6 years already.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d prefer to have Fuji — their colors are so much better to look at — but I wanted to keep investment low just in case in two months I decide I don’t need it all. And the cheapest Fuji setup would be 2x from a5100 — partially because Sony’s kit lens is so cheaply made, ugh! Also, when I compared a5100 autofocus performance to my beloved X-T1 my jaw just dropped. Reviews suggest that newer Fuji cameras have improved greatly, but still are not on par with Sony.</p>
<h2 id="mount">Mount</h2>
<p>Of course, you can’t just put a camera on your display. Webcams can do that, haha, should’ve gone that way, right? Tripod is an option if you have a place to put it beside a table, but I don’t. So I watched some YouTube videos to see how people mount cameras to film themselves and discovered a Magic Arm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aside</em>: did I tell you I had to watch a lot of videos instead of reading text to discover everything? No? Now I did. It’s a bit painful, but lots and lots of information are in video format only, and text articles about streaming are hard to find and incomplete. I guess including this one. :-)</p>

<p>Back to the story. I never saw Magic Arms before, but the way they work is magical.</p>
<p>It seems that Manfrotto invented that stuff (can’t find reliable sources, but I recall reading somewhere it was invented in 2008), but now everyone and their grandma are making clones of it. Clones are not even close in terms of quality to Manfrotto’s products (or Matthews Infinity Arm, or other costly brands), but they are cheap! You can get a “decent” one along with a “crab” clamp for around 20-25$ here in Ukraine (and even cheaper on AliExpress). It’s made from aluminum and will die on you if you use it a lot, of course, but the plan is to leave it sitting in place.</p>
<p>So I bought a monitor stand (it was around $30) and put a magic arm there, and a little $4 ball head, and — bam! — camera is looking right at me now.</p>
<h2 id="microphone">Microphone</h2>
<p>They say that there are three important things in a video, in that order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video</li>
</ol>
<p>And… did you know that camera’s mic is the worst mic ever? By a weird coincidence — I tried to make a video with Fuji X-T1 a few times — I already knew that. They pick up weird frequency profiles (to a point where I can’t listen to my voice from those mics), and they are <em>noisy as hell</em>. My MacBook’s mic array is vastly superior to a camera mic! As you can guess to make all that feel more real I need an external microphone.</p>
<p>I knew next to nothing about mics, and I didn’t just want to buy a Blue Yeti because it’s a layman’s choice. Plus I had an audio interface with XLR input and a 48V phantom power<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So I went to read and watch some videos on mics and after some point stumbled upon <a href="https://www.neatmic.com/bee/worker-bee-microphone/">Neat Worker Bee</a> — see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScI1U3ey9ZY&amp;t=630s">review</a> at Podcastage (which is one of two channels I liked about audio, the other being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/curtisjudd">Curtis Judd</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="worker bee image" height="300px" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iDWBewlfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"></p><p>It turns out Neat Microphones were a subsidiary of Gibson and made some upper-class mics: like Worker Bee for $200 and King Bee for $300. But after Gibson’s bankruptcy Neat’s CEO (and maybe some others, IDK) was able to buy it out. That CEO  — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipper_Wise">Skipper Wise</a> — is also one of the founders of Blue Microphones. So Neat Mics are independent now and decided to change their pricing strategy. Unfortunately, King Bee is not produced anymore, but Worker Bee is sold for $90, which is a steal! It has loads of glowing reviews on YouTube and the design… it’s funny, and it’s different, and I just like it. Too bad that it’s mostly black from the back (especially sitting in a cradle), so it’s a bit less interesting in a captured video than I hoped. But I bought one anyway.</p>
<p>Other big brands you probably know of — like Audio-Technica and Shure — are great as well. There are some other great companies I’ve never heard of before, like RØDE.</p>
<p>Various tests say that your listeners won’t be able to tell the difference if you have any mic costing from about $100. Do whatever you want with that information.</p>
<h2 id="sound-processing">Sound processing</h2>
<p><img alt="presonus audiobox 22vsl image" src="https://pae-web.presonusmusic.com/uploads/products/media/images/AudioBox_22VSL-02.png"></p><p>I mentioned that I already have an XLR interface to drive the mic — it’s <a href="https://www.presonus.com/products/AudioBox-22VSL">Presonus AudioBox 22VSL</a>. It’s a good interface with reasonably good pre-amplifiers. Can I complain? You bet! I’m an expert complainer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>!</p>
<p>And the main complaint is that it’s just an audio interface. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p>There are a few things you could do with your voice: de-noise, compression, and equalization.</p>
<p>De-noise is self-describing, but important: when you stream, your laptop is going to make a lot of sound spinning coolers. This generates a lot of background noise which tires your listeners. What’s more important, it drives me mad. This could be done in a simpler way, like noise gate — just silencing signal under some volume level, and in a more intelligent way, learning noise and then trying to clean the whole duration of a recording.</p>
<p>Compression is a really interesting way to improve voice signal: make quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter, “compressing” your sound volume to some middle level. This is good because then your distance to the microphone becomes less important, and what’s especially good — changing distance to a mic is much less pronounced, with a volume level being more stable.</p>
<p>Equalizers are used for two purposes. First is altering the perception of recorded voice — add lows to make it sound fuller, remove them if it sounds “muddy”; add highs to make it airier, remove if it cuts your ears; alter mids for better understanding; you know, usual equalizer stuff. Another one is that mics are not perfect and the recorded voice could have some irritating frequencies. Go see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn6iB1SNvRQ">Curtis' video</a> on that — it’s pretty interesting, but it’s a bit too hard. I tried looking at my recordings but it feels like it needs someone with a trained ear. :)</p>
<p>There are two ways how to do those things: either you’re doing that on your computer or it’s done in a DSP of your audio interface. DSP is vastly superior, of course: it does not add latency, there is no additional load on your CPU, and last, but not least, all your audio receiving apps will receive same processed sound, be it OBS, Zoom, browser or anything else. But, of course, 22VSL has no DSP — it’s just an audio interface! So I have to do all that in software.</p>
<p><img alt="voicemeeter image" src="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/VoicemeeterBananaMixer.jpg"></p><p>For software let’s look at Windows side first. There is an app for Windows called <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm">VoiceMeeter Banana</a>, which replaces the system mixer and allows you to do all the things you want — compressor, eq, even some de-noising. And then silently sits in the tray. Nothing like that exists for macOS! Every article on the web tells you “get a DAW and put a sound through there”. DAW is something like SoundForge or Cubase or Ableton Live or Reaper. All of them are pretty expensive (Reaper is cheapest from 60$), eat a lot of memory, have highly cryptic interfaces, and are not resident apps. Each and every one of them thinks it’s the <em>main</em> app of your life, eating like 10% of a core just to sit there. Ugh. GIVE ME BANANA!</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Perhaps my favorite time of the year is when the annual Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">WWDC</a> conference occurs. I am heavily inspired by Apple’s Software and Hardware meld, and I truly enjoy nearly every ounce of the conference. But nothing compares to the love I have for the macOS operating system. With it’s deep history and Unix origins, it brings an interesting take on a consumer operating system.</p>

<p>But macOS has one central problem, it’s almost entirely proprietary. macOS consists of <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">a few open source components</a>, and a majority proprietary components. As someone with a strong Open Source origin and a professional grounding in software companies, it can be hard for me to sympathize with the belief that all software should be Open Source, but at the same time, I’m a curious developer, and I love knowing how things work.</p>

<p>This is what excites me every time a new macOS release is announced. I want to understand the technical foundations and changes on an entusiast level!</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve built a macOS system analysis tool called <a href="https://github.com/kendfinger/jolk">jolk</a>. jolk aims to scan and analyze all the executables found on a macOS installation and reports results about interesting findings.</p>

<p>First, let me dive into the most important note in this entire post. I am doing this purely as an enthusiest. I want to understand what makes up the macOS operating system. For example, I want to understand what daemons run when I use my FaceTime HD Camera on my MacBook Pro, or how the boot process on Apple M1 devices work. There is no intention of malicious use in this tool.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-jolk">What is jolk?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kendfinger/jolk">jolk</a> is a tool which will scan, analyze, and report the executables installed on a macOS system, providing useful details which can help whittle down to interesting aspects of the system. jolk is portmanteau of the words jog and walk. This is an personal inside joke to the time in which I owned the domain <code>idont.run</code>.</p>

<p>jolk combines a system executable finder and an executable analyzer. Using various built-in macOS development tools, you can discover a lot about what is installed on a system. jolk automates that task.</p>

<p>jolk currently supports the following analyzer passes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lipo: discovers what architectures an executable supports using, you guessed it, the <code>lipo</code> tool.</li>
  <li>dynamic linker: determines frameworks and libraries that the executable links to.</li>
  <li>launchd: finds launchd services which reference the executable.</li>
  <li>strings: scans the executable for interesting strings.</li>
  <li>man page: backsearches man pages for mentions of the executable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-can-i-use-jolk">How can I use jolk?</h2>

<p>jolk can be ran by cloning the repository and building the jolk tool with Xcode.</p>

<p>Let’s start with an example usage of jolk to discover what the <code>/usr/libexec/remotectl</code> executable does.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jolk <span>-o</span> remotectl.json <span>-i</span> <span>'/usr/libexec/remotectl'</span>
analyze /usr/libexec/remotectl
<span>complete</span> /usr/libexec/remotectl 253.41ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will produce a JSON report in the file <code>remotectl.json</code> which contains relevant information about the <code>remotectl</code> utility.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"/usr/libexec/remotectl"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

      </span><span>"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/RemoteServiceDiscovery.framework"</span><span>,</span><span>

    </span><span>],</span><span>
    </span><span>"lipo.architectures"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmm, it appears from the entry <code>"strings.likely.has-usage" : true</code> that this command has a usage message, lets run the tool to see if we can capture the usage.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>/usr/libexec/remotectl

usage: remotectl <span>alias</span> <span>(</span><span>type</span>|name|uuid|trait<span>)</span> <span>alias</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also appears that <code>remotectl</code> links to the framework <code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/RemoteServiceDiscovery.framework</code>, I bet that’s got some interesting uses. Maybe I will investigate other executables later that use this framework. By running jolk without an <code>include</code> flag, we can scan the entire system, and find any executables that link this framework.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>My ultimate goal is for jolk is to be able to scan, diff, and analyze multiple macOS releases to discover what has truly changed about the system between releases. Please don’t hesitate to create issues on the repository for suggestions or improvements.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>jolk is intended to be used for enthusiast analysis of a macOS system. I hope other enthusiasts find this tool interesting and useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>I believe that we can do a better job of managing the complexity of our apps.</p>
<p>Not many of us realize how many second-order effects our decisions have caused.</p>
<p>Let’s see how complexity had grown over time.</p>
<h2>The Static era</h2>
<p>Simple times. We had a MySQL database, business logic and HTML + CSS views.</p>
<p>All content was static, the browser’s job was to display content, navigate and submit forms.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/5a46cad524761cec773ff2212a339f3b/23296/simple.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  <img alt="Simple web app architecture diagram" title="Simple web app architecture diagram" src="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/5a46cad524761cec773ff2212a339f3b/f058b/simple.png" srcset="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/5a46cad524761cec773ff2212a339f3b/c26ae/simple.png 158w,

<p>I like to think about test effort as a benchmark for simplicity. There were 3 layers.</p>
<p>Business logic and persistence layer can be easily integrated and view layer can be browser tested.</p>
<p>You may need a tester, developer, and a designer to maintain something like this. It is realistic to have one person responsible for all of this.</p>
<h2>The AJAX era</h2>
<p>JavaScript opened a door for more considerations in user experience. Adding a dynamic menu, forms, or calendar to a WordPress website was the coolest thing you could do.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/e4346edb319dee1705e11e6dd38791a4/23296/ajax.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="web app with javascript architecture diagram" title="web app with javascript architecture diagram" src="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/e4346edb319dee1705e11e6dd38791a4/f058b/ajax.png" srcset="https://michalpietraszko.com/static/e4346edb319dee1705e11e6dd38791a4/c26ae/ajax.png 158w,

<p>We have a complexity spike on the client-side.</p>
<p>Many browsers differed in JS implementation, which required jQuery to come into existence.</p>
<p>This gave a lot of power to designers and has moved more engineering effort into the front end. JavaScript made the browser extensible.</p>
<p>Did the testing complexity increase? Yes. Each new JavaScript bit could only be tested in a browser.</p>
<p>This requires testing, backend programming, JavaScript, and design expertise in your team. Jumping between server-side and client-side languages became frustrating. There was a trend to have different people responsible for each side.</p>
<h2>The Single-page era</h2>
<p>Remember the first example of the Angular.js app? The input field that automatically updated the content of the div? Good times.</p>
<p>Welcome to the single-page era where front-end development became even more complex than back-end development - mostly due to relevant logic moving to the client. As a result, the divide has increased and <a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4">JavaScript fatigue</a> became a thing.</p>

<p>We have ended up with two apps that are tightly coupled.</p>
<p>To maintain this, you need at least someone experienced in testing, backend, frontend development (extensive framework, tooling, and browser knowledge), and design.</p>
<p>Now, two apps have to be maintained, and there is much more code than ever. You have to maintain unit, integration, and end to end tests on both sides. Now business logic is not directly accessible due to security concerns.
Frontend and backend now have to maintain layers that are responsible for communication.</p>
<p>Client code needs lots of API mocks to be tested on lower levels - DOM tests are resource-heavy.</p>
<p>Orchestration becomes difficult because you have to make sure that deployments are synchronized. It is even more difficult if you have separate teams for the backend and frontend.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about browser testing that also can have a lot of overlap with client-side integration tests. Even more, things to consider in terms of complexity and trade-offs.</p>
<p>That resulted in more code, which contributed to - again - increased complexity.</p>
<p>SEO became problematic, but thankfully this problem has been addressed by the ecosystem through <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html">server-side rendering</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydration</a>.</p>
<p>Good patterns have emerged too. UX became better and more creative. We are finally capable of defining client-side logic in a manageable and scalable way.</p>
<p>We all know now that we want to have components and avoid excessive side effects, together with uncontrollable state mutation.</p>
<p>React de facto became a standard.</p>
<h2>Simplicity renaissance</h2>
<p>The remedy to complexity is embracing the coupling and making the developer experience unified.</p>

<h3>Simplicity through innovation in older frameworks.</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails and Laravel are relevant.</p>
<p>Consider them. Their maturity will allow you to move very fast.</p>
<p>They have recently innovated in many interesting ways.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#components">Laravel’s components</a> or RoR’s <a href="https://hotwire.dev/">Hotwire</a>!</p>
<p>You can have an SPA experience while still writing a unified app!</p>
<h3>Simplicity through new generation of React frameworks.</h3>
<p>People who want to stay in JavaScript land should consider the following.</p>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> started a good trend by putting React and server logic next to each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, which is based on Next, is a good ruby on rails equivalent. It brings the right amount of abstraction that makes you treat your app as a unified whole. Using it sometimes feels like cheating - in a good way. It inspired me to talk about the complexity issue in our ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> with a fresh take on the problem domain and bringing a lot of good and forgotten patterns.</p>
<h3>React’s Server Components to make everything even better.</h3>
<p>Recently, the React team has presented a new idea that can make our component-driven world better.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">Consider reading the article and watching their presentation</a>.</p>
<p>When they are released, then we will end up in the best-case scenario where web apps are only dynamic in
places that require it without having to jump between server-side and client-side paradigms.</p>
<p>All of the frameworks above will benefit from them.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>We should start asking ourselves if our standard approach is something we still want to maintain.</p>
<p>Suggested frameworks reduce complexity and allow us to experience the simplicity of older approaches while having the benefits of the modern approach.</p>
<p>They embrace the fact that both backend and frontend are tightly coupled and make the developer experience unified.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to write less code, spend less time testing, simplify orchestration, spend less money on more people having to maintain the complexity, and put more effort into products we are trying to create.</p></section></div>]]>

			<p>Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash<br>
system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending.<br>
It’s completely decentralized with no server or central authority.</p>
<p>See bitcoin.org for screenshots.</p>
<p>Download link:<br>
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar</p>
<p>Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.</p>
<p>– Unpack the files into a directory<br>
– Run BITCOIN.EXE<br>
– It automatically connects to other nodes</p>
<p>If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,<br>
you’ll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your<br>
firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.</p>
<p>The software is still alpha and experimental. There’s no guarantee<br>
the system’s state won’t have to be restarted at some point if it<br>
becomes necessary, although I’ve done everything I can to build in<br>
extensibility and versioning.</p>
<p>You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on<br>
Options-&gt;Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made<br>
the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so<br>
for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to<br>
generate coins in just a few hours. It’ll get a lot harder when<br>
competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.<br>
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be<br>
spent.</p>
<p>There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you<br>
can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public<br>
key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is<br>
not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which<br>
is a hash of their public key that they give you. They’ll receive<br>
the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it’s<br>
in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information<br>
is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used<br>
multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can’t<br>
be online at the same time or the recipient can’t receive incoming<br>
connections.</p>
<p>Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It’ll be distributed<br>
to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half<br>
every 4 years.</p>
<p>first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins<br>
etc…</p>
<p>When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if<br>
needed. It’s based on open market competition, and there will<br>
probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent">
				<p>After the introduction to <code>std::atomic_flag</code> in my last post <a href="https://bit.ly/3nF8r3f">Synchronization with Atomics in C++20</a>, I want to dive deeper. Today, I create a ping-pong game using condition variables,<code> std::atomic_flag</code>, and <code>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code>. Let's play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/PerformanceComparisonConditionVariablesAtomics/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="265"></p>
<p>The key question I want to answer in this post is the following: What is the fastest way to synchronize threads in C++20? I use in this post three different data types: <code>std::condition_variable</code>, <code>std::atomic_flag</code>, and <code>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To get comparable numbers, I implement a ping-pong game. One thread executes a <code>ping</code> function and the other thread a <code>pong</code> function. For simplicity reasons, I call the thread executing the <code>ping</code> function the ping thread and the other thread the pong thread. The ping thread waits for the notification of the pong threads and sends the notification back to the pong thread. The game stops after 1,000,000 ball changes. I perform each game five times to get comparable performance numbers.</p>
<p>I made my performance test with the brand new Visual Studio compiler because it already supports synchronization with atomics. Additionally, I compiled the examples with maximum optimization (<code>/Ox</code>).</p>

<p>Let me start with the C++11.</p>

<p>I use two condition variables in the program: <code>condVar1</code> and <code>condVar2 </code>(line 1 and 2). The ping thread wait for the notification of <code>condVar1</code> and sends its notification with <code>condVar2</code>. <code>dataReady</code> protects against spurious and lost wakeups (see "<a href="http://modernescpp.com/index.php/c-core-guidelines-be-aware-of-the-traps-of-condition-variables">C++ Core Guidelines: Be Aware of the Traps of Condition Variables</a>"). The ping-pong game ends when <code>counter</code> reaches the <code>countlimit</code>. The <code>nofication_one</code> calls (lines 3) and the counter are thread-safe and are, therefore, outside the critical region.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers:</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/PerformanceComparisonConditionVariablesAtomics/pingPongConditionVariable.png" alt="pingPongConditionVariable" width="400" height="294"></p>
<p>The average execution time is 0.52 seconds.</p>
<p>Porting this play to <code>std::atomic_flags</code>'s in C++20 is straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="h2-std-atomic-flag"><code>std::atomic_flag</code></h2>
<p>Here is the play using two atomic flags.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-two-atomic-flags">Two Atomic Flags</h3>
<p>In the following program, I replace the waiting on the condition variable with the waiting on the atomic flag and the notification of the condition variable with the setting of the atomic flag followed by the notification.</p>

<p>A call <code>condAtomicFlag1.wait(false)</code> (1) blocks, if the value of the atomic flag is <code>false</code>. On the contrary, it returns if <code>condAtomicFlag1</code> has the value <code>true</code>. The boolean value serves as a kind of predicate and must, therefore, set back to <code>false</code> (2). Before the notification (3) is sent to the pong thread,&nbsp;<code>condAtomicFlag1</code> is set to <code>true </code>(4). The initial setting of<code> condAtomicFlag1</code> to <code>true</code> (5) starts the game. <span></span></p>
<p>Thanks to <code>std::atomic_flag</code> the game ends earlier.</p>

<p>On average, a game takes 0.32 seconds.</p>
<p>When you analyze the program, you may recognize, that one atomics flag is sufficient for the play.</p>

<p>In this case, the ping thread blocks on <code>true</code> but the pong thread blocks on <code>false</code>. From the performance perspective, using one or two atomic flags makes no difference.</p>

<p>The average execution time is 0.31 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I used in this example <code>std::atomic_flag</code> such as an atomic boolean. Let's give it another try with<code> std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><code>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code> can internally use a locking mechanism such as a mutex. As I assumed it, my Windows runtime is lock-free (1).</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/PerformanceComparisonConditionVariablesAtomics/pingPongAtomicBool.png" alt="pingPongAtomicBool" width="400" height="539"></p>
<p>On average, the execution time is 0.38 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="h4-all-numbers">All Numbers</h2>
<p>As expected, condition variables are the slowest way, and atomic flag the fastest way to synchronize threads. The performance of a<code> std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code> is in-between. But there is one downside with <code>std:.atomic&lt;bool&gt;. std::atomic_flag i</code>s the only atomic data type which is lock-free.</p>

<h2 id="h5-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>With C++20, we have a few new mechanisms for thread coordination. In my next post, I will take a deeper view into latches, barriers, and semaphores. They also allow it to play Ping-Pong.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>Back in May I read <a href="https://salon.thefamily.co/the-five-stages-of-denial-6061dbbfb62d?gi=f8b1c8036dda">an article</a> by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-colin-the-family/" target="_blank">Nicolas Colin</a>, founder of The Family, a VC and PE firm. The article speaks about the five stages of denial that companies go through when their industry goes through disruption. The article is framed around big industries like Music, Film, Publishing and Retail, and how large companies in these industries become disrupted by tech upstarts. What I’ve realized, and what I’ve been thinking increasingly frequently, is that these tech upstarts have increasingly become Lazy Giants.  </p>



<p>A Lazy Giant is a specific kind of giant. Every company, when it reaches a certain size, becomes a giant, and decisions that giants make have large ripples across entire industries. However a Lazy Giant is a company that loses track of it’s original goal, and starts to focus on being profitable at the cost of everything else, sometimes even eventually it’s own long term profitability. </p>







<p>The first company that I want to talk about is Facebook. I don’t like using Facebook. I occasionally open Facebook in a tab to check for any valuable notifications or any birthdays. Facebook, originally, was in the business of creating social networks. Helping people keep in touch with old friends and colleagues and for sharing photos of your family holiday. However the monetization of the platform comes from selling our attention to advertisers. Facebook have been optimizing their algorithms to keep users scrolling and to keep them looking at ads, rather than helping them to stay in touch with friends.</p>



<p>But, you might argue, Facebook has just pivoted. They are now an advertising company, and optimise for their advertising algorithm. They aren’t a Lazy Giant, they are just focusing on a different problem, how to get ads in front of the right people. </p>



<p>The issue with this is that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/24/facebook-ad-targeting-small-business/" target="_blank">Facebook admits that their advertising algorithm isn’t that good</a>. Facebook isn’t optimizing their advertising algorithm to maximize utility to advertisers, they are optimizing their algorithm to maximize the amount of money that they can charge advertisers. Why would Facebook make their algorithm more efficient if they charge per view? </p>



<p>(This is where the anticompetitive argument against Facebook starts to hold water. If social networks were competing for advertising bucks they would be forced to show that their algorithm is more efficient than their competition. As it is, Facebook and Instagram have similar algorithms and aren’t forced to be better than anyone else, or even any good for that matter.)</p>







<p>The second giant that I think has gotten lazy is Amazon. I have a large amount of respect for Jeff Bezos, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://blog.idonethis.com/jeff-bezos-self-discipline-writing/" target="_blank">specifically the way that he runs meetings at Amazon</a>. However, for a company that claims to be obsessively customer focused, they sure <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ft.com/content/bb03ba1c-add3-4440-9bf2-2a65566aef4a" target="_blank">have had a lot of scandals around</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud" target="_blank">their product reviews</a>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ft.com/content/bb03ba1c-add3-4440-9bf2-2a65566aef4a" target="_blank">A FT investigation found suspicious behavior by 9 of top 10 UK contributors on feedback</a>. </p>



<p>But the scandal that I only more recently became aware of is a bait and switch technique that some sellers are using, where they take a successful product listing with lots of positive reviews, and change the product to something else that isn’t as good. Customers see the positive reviews and assume that it is for the product listed, trusting the Amazon reviews. </p>



<p>In this article the author bought a mini drone, only to find out that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/amazon-still-hasnt-fixed-its-problem-with-bait-and-switch-reviews/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=cutting_room_floor" target="_blank">most of the reviews on the product were for a jar of honey</a>. This is an easy problem to solve. Just limit the amount of changes that can be made to a product while keeping the reviews. If Amazon was as obsessively customer focused as they say, this would have already been fixed. But is hasn’t, because positive reviews encourage people to spend more on Amazon, further lining the pockets of the company. </p>



<p>But the problem for Amazon isn’t just with reviews. Investigations by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/heres-how-amazon-gets-you-to-buy-its-own-products-why-thats-bad-news-for-third-party-sellers.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> have found that Amazon promotes its own products, products that it makes and has a larger margin on, above products made by 3rd party sellers, even when the 3rd party seller’s product has better reviews. This isn’t the “customer obsession” that Bezos claims, this is profit obsession. Despite Amazon’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/21/what-is-jeff-bezos-day-1-philosophy/" target="_blank">Day 1 mentality</a>, Amazon is turning, in parts, into a Lazy Giant. </p>



<p>The final Lazy Giant I want to mention is Google. Google is a giant that operates in many industries, including entertainment (YouTube), advertising (AdWords), enterprise solutions (Gmail and Drive), and IoT hardware/software (Nest). I have mixed feelings on Google. On one hand, I love my Google Home devices. On the other hand, I’m using YouTube less because I’m finding the suggestions to be less intellectually stimulating than I would like and there are too many adverts. </p>



<p>But today I want to talk about Google Docs. I remember at school when people first started to use Google Docs. The idea that the documents were stored on the cloud, and that we could edit them simultaneously? That blew my mind. And then Google did the same thing with Slides and Sheets, replicating Microsoft’s PowerPoint and Excel. Both of these tools were good, but neither as smooth or powerful as the Microsoft original. But hey, it was only early days. Or so I thought.</p>



<p>Since then Google haven’t changed a thing. As this article explains lucidly, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secondbreakfast.co/google-blew-a-ten-year-lead" target="_blank">Google managed to blow a 10 year lead</a>. Microsoft Word is now accessible online, and can auto-save online using OneDrive. Of the three giants that I mention here, Google is the one I am most disappointed in (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/dont-be-evil" target="_blank">especially since they removed “Don’t Be Evil” from their code of conduct</a>). </p>



<p>Now, not all tech giants are destined to become Lazy Giants. Microsoft, for example, is still learning from it’s rivals, producing quality software and hardware, and generally doing good work. Netflix, a more recent giant, is still focusing on the goal of bringing entertainment to the world, and they are thriving. </p>



<p>Overall, I think that all companies, not just tech companies, should start to worry when they stop trying to solve problems, and start trying to make money. Making money is not a reason for a company to exist, nor is it a fulfilling reason to get up in the morning. Solving problems, however, is both. </p>

    <p>Haskell is the first programming language we reach for when we build production software systems. This likely seems unusual to anyone who only has a passing familiarity with the language. Haskell has a reputation for being an advanced language with a steep learning curve. It is also often thought of as a research language with limited practical utility.</p>
<p>While Haskell does have a very large surface area, with many concepts and a syntax that will feel unfamiliar to programmers coming from most other languages, it is unrivaled in the combination of developer productivity, code maintainability, software reliability, and performance that it offers. In this post I will cover some of the defining features of Haskell that make it an excellent, industrial-strength language that is well-suited for building commercial software, and why it is usually the first tool we consider using for new projects.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="haskell-has-a-strong-static-type-system-that-prevents-errors-and-reduces-cognitive-load">Haskell has a strong static type system that prevents errors and reduces cognitive load</h2>
<p>Haskell has a very powerful static type system which serves as a programmer aid that catches and prevents many errors before code ever even runs. Many programmers encounter statically typed languages like Java or C++ and find that the compiler feels like an annoyance. By contrast, Haskell’s static type system, in conjunction with compile-time type checking, acts as an invaluable pair-programming buddy that gives instantaneous feedback during development.</p>
<p>There’s a far smaller cognitive load that needs to be maintained when writing Haskell than when writing in languages like Python, JavaScript, or PHP. Many concerns can be completely offloaded to the compiler rather than needing to be remembered by the programmer. For example, when writing Haskell, there’s no need to preemptively ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need to check whether this field is null?</li>
<li>What if fields are missing from the request payload?</li>
<li>Has this string already been decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>What if this string can’t be decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>Will this operator implicitly convert this integer to a string?</li>
<li>Are these two values comparable?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that these are questions that never need answering in Haskell; it’s to say that the compiler will throw an error when you need to address one of these issues. For example, it’s possible that a Haskell program needs to handle values that are sometimes not present, but instead of setting any value to <code>NULL</code>, a Haskell programmer must use a <code>Maybe</code> type, which indicates that the value may not be there, and the compiler forces the programmer to explicitly handle the <code>Nothing</code> value; the case where the value is not present.</p>
<p>Haskell’s static type system also leads to other benefits. Haskell code uses type signatures that precede its functions and describe the types of each parameter and return value. For example, a signature like <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool</code> indicates that a function takes two integers and returns a boolean value. Since these type signatures are checked and enforced by the compiler, this allows a programmer reading Haskell code to look only at type signatures when getting a sense of what a certain piece of code does. For example, one would not use the type signature above when looking for a function that manipulates strings, decodes JSON, or queries a database.</p>
<p>Type signatures can even be used to search through the entire corpus of Haskell code for a relevant function. Using <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoogle</a>, Haskell’s API search, we can search for a type signature based off of functionality we know that we need. For example, if we need to convert an <code>Int</code> to a <code>Float</code>, we can search Hoogle for <code>Int -&gt; Float</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Int+-%3E+Float" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the aptly named <code>int2Float</code> function.</p>
<p>Haskell also lets us create polymorphic type signatures through the use of type variables, represented by lowercase type names. For example, a signature of <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; a</code> tells us that that the function takes two parameters of two arbitrary types, and returns a value that whose type is the same as the first parameter. Suppose we want to check whether an element is in a list. We’re looking for a function that takes an item to search for, a list of items, and returns a boolean. We don’t care about the type of the item, so long as the search item and the items in the list are of the same type. So we can search Hoogle for <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=a%20-%3E%20%5Ba%5D%20-%3E%20Bool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the <code>elem</code> function. Parametric types are an extremely powerful feature in Haskell and are what enable writing reusable code.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-enables-writing-code-that-is-composable-testable-and-has-predictable-side-effects">Haskell enables writing code that is composable, testable, and has predictable side-effects</h2>
<p>In addition to being statically typed, Haskell is a pure functional programming language. This is one of Haskell’s defining features and what the language is well known for, even amongst programmers that have only heard of Haskell but never used it. Writing in a pure functional style has many benefits, and is conducive to a well-organized code base.</p>
<p>The word “pure” in “pure functional programming” is significant. Purity in this sense means that the code we write is pure, or free of side-effects. Another term that describes this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referential transparency</a>, or the property where any expression (e.g.&nbsp;a function call with a given list of parameters) can be replaced with its return value without changing the functionality of the code. This is only possible when such pure functions do not have side effects, such as creating files on the host system, running database queries, or making HTTP requests. Haskell’s type system imposes this sort of purity.</p>
<p>So does being pure mean that Haskell programs cannot have side effects? Certainly not—but it does mean that effects are pushed to the edge of our system. Any functions that perform I/O actions (such as querying a database or receiving HTTP requests) must have a return type that captures this. This means that type signatures like the ones we saw in the previous section (e.g.&nbsp;<code>Int -&gt; Float</code> or <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code>) are indicators that the corresponding functions do not produce side effects, since <code>Float</code> and <code>Bool</code> are just primitive return types. For a contrasting example that includes a side effect, a function signature of <code>FilePath -&gt; IO String</code> indicates that the function takes a file path and performs an I/O action that returns a string (which is exactly what the <code>readFile</code> function does).</p>
<p>Another feature of a pure functional programming paradigm is higher-order functions, which are functions that take functions as parameters. One of the most commonly used higher-order functions is <code>fmap</code>, which applies a function to each value in a container (such as a list). For example, we can apply a function named <code>square</code>, which takes an integer and returns that integer multiplied by itself, to a list of integers to turn it into a list of squared integers:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>square ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">square x <span>=</span> x <span>*</span> x</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>fmap</span> square [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>] <span>-- returns [1,4,9,16,25]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Code written in this style tends to be both composable and testable. This above example is trivial, but there are many applications of higher-order functions. For example, we can write a function like <code>renderPost</code> which takes a record of post data and returns the version of the post rendered in HTML. If we have a list of posts, we can run <code>fmap renderPost postList</code> to produce a list of rendered posts. Our <code>renderPost</code> function can be used in both the single case and the multi-post case without any changes, because composing it with <code>fmap</code> changes how we can apply it. We can also write tests for the <code>renderPost</code> function and compose it with <code>fmap</code> in our tests when validating the behavior for a list of posts.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-facilitates-rapid-development-worry-free-refactoring-and-excellent-maintainability">Haskell facilitates rapid development, worry-free refactoring, and excellent maintainability</h2>
<p>Through the combination of the aforementioned static types and pure functional style that Haskell has, developing software in Haskell tends to be very fast. One of the common development workflows we employ is relies on a tool called <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ghcid</code></a>, a simple command line tool that relies on the Haskell REPL to automatically watch code for changes and incrementally recompile. This allows us to see any compiler errors in our code immediately after saving changes to a file. It’s not uncommon for us to open only a terminal with a text editor in one pane and <code>ghcid</code> in another while developing applications in Haskell.</p>
<p>While manually validating the results of our code is eventually necessary, such as by refreshing a page in a browser or using a tool to validate a JSON endpoint, a lot of this can be deferred until the end of a programming session. Many of the runtime errors that a programmer would encounter when writing a web service in a language like Python or PHP are caught immediately and displayed as compiler errors by <code>ghcid</code>. This is a far cry from the need to switch to a browser window and refresh the page after making a change to some code; a development workflow that everyone who has worked on a web application is intimately familiar with.</p>
<p>Beyond the tight feedback loop during development, Haskell code is easy to refactor and modify. Like real world code written in any other language, such code written in Haskell is not write-only. It will eventually need to be maintained, updated, and extended, often by developers that are not the original authors of the code. With the aid of compile-time checking, many code refactors in Haskell become easy; a common refactoring workflow is to make a desired change in one location and then fix one compiler error at a time until the program compiles again. This is far easier than the equivalent changes in dynamically typed languages that offer no such assistance to the programmer.</p>
<p>Proponents of dynamically typed languages will often argue that automated tests supplant the need for compile-time type checking, and can help prevent errors as well. However, tests are not as powerful as type constraints. For tests to be effective, they must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Actually be written, yet many real world code bases have limited testing.</li>
<li>Make correct assertions.</li>
<li>Be …</li></ol></div></div>

  <p><span>30 Oct 2020</span></p><p>In this blog post, I’ll try to explain how you can create a really simple installer for your Haskell software on Windows and how to deal with external dependencies.</p>



<p>Alright, let’s get started. We are going to build a simple installer. It will install a desktop shortcut as well as a link shortcut in the start menu.
We will be using <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to build our Haskell project and <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page">NSIS</a> to write the installer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: GHC 8.8.[2|3|4] as well as 8.10.[1|2] are broken on windows so while we wait for 8.10.3 to fix everything, we will have to use 8.6.5 for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distributing software with external dependencies is slightly more complicated but not uncommon. We will make our project use <a href="https://github.com/lpsmith/postgresql-simple/">postgresql-simple</a> so we can learn how to deal with dependencies <img title=":books:" alt=":books:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I will assume you have Postgresql, Stack, and NSIS installed already! Also, I’ll be using Powershell as a terminal.</p>



<p>So let’s start by creating a simple dummy project: <code>stack new hello-world-app</code></p>

<p>As said before we want to use GHC 8.6.5 so let’s fix the resolver in <code>stack.yml</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>resolver</span><span>:</span> <span>lts-14.27</span> <span># use ghc 8.6.5</span>

<p>We also want to use postgresql-simple so let’s add a dependency in <code>package.yml</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span><span>:</span>

<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we make our software use only one function which query our postgres DB just to make sure it’s running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings   #-}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, next we build it with <code>stack build</code> and it should… not work…
Indeed, stack will fail something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;command line&gt;: can't load .so/.DLL for: C:/PROGRA~1/POSTGR~1/13/lib\libpq.dll (addDLL: C:\PROGRA~1\POSTGR~1\13\lib\libpq or dependencies not loaded. (Win32 er)

--  While building package hello-world-app-0.0.0 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using:
      C:\sr\setup-exe-cache\x86_64-windows\Cabal-simple_Z6RU0evB_2.4.0.1_ghc-8.6.5.exe --builddir=.stack-work\dist\e626a42b build lib:hello-world-app exe:hello-world-app-exe --ghc-options " -fdiagnostics-color=always"
    Process exited with code: ExitFailure 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To build our project, stack is telling us that it needs <code>libpq.dll</code>. So let’s add the missing dependencies path to our path.
with Powershell you can use this command: <code>$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin"</code>. It will temporarily modify the path variable for the current terminal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can use <code>$env:path.split(";")</code> to print the current value for the PATH variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, now it should build without errors! We can try to execute it as well with: <code>stack exec hello-world-app-exe</code> and… tadaaa <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20">, our project is running! We can save our work and call it a day? <img title=":blush:" alt=":blush:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60a.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Well, not really no. We still need to build our installer…</p>



<p>I picked NSIS but you might want to investigate other tools as well (<a href="https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a> to name one). NSIS documentation felt nice and the fact that it came with examples, tutorials and a simple compiler convinced me into using it.</p>

<p>The idea behind an installer is that you write a script that will explain how to install software. The syntax is quite low level but it’s not that hard either.</p>

<p>So let’s write a simple installer in <code>installer.nsi</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># we start by defining variables</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>APPNAME</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>COMPANYNAME</span> <span>"BestCompanyEver"</span>

<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>EXECUTABLE_NAME</span> <span>"hello-world-app-exe.exe"</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>ICON_NAME</span> <span>"icon.ico"</span>

<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONMAJOR</span> <span>1</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONMINOR</span> <span>0</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONPATCH</span> <span>0</span>

<span># create a directory where we will put our assets (eg: image, executable, uninstaller, dependencies...)</span>
<span>InstallDir</span> <span>"$PROGRAMFILES</span><span>\$</span><span>{COMPANYNAME}</span><span>\$</span><span>{VERSIONMAJOR}.${VERSIONMINOR}.${VERSIONPATCH}"</span> <span>#(ie: C:\Program Files\BestCompanyEver\1.0.0\)</span>

<span># Define the installer name</span>
<span>outFile</span> <span>"hello-world-app-installer.exe"</span>

<span>section</span> <span>"install"</span>
	<span>setOutPath</span> <span>$INSTDIR</span>

    <span># copy the executable in the installation directory</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>EXECUTABLE_NAME</span><span>}</span>

	<span># create a start menu shortcut</span>
	<span>createShortCut</span> <span>"$SMPROGRAMS</span><span>\$</span><span>{COMPANYNAME}</span><span>\$</span><span>{APPNAME}.lnk"</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{EXECUTABLE_NAME}"</span> <span>""</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{ICON_NAME}"</span>
	<span># create a desktop shortcut</span>
    <span>createShortCut</span> <span>"$DESKTOP</span><span>\$</span><span>{APPNAME}.lnk"</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{EXECUTABLE_NAME}"</span> <span>""</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{ICON_NAME}"</span>
<span>sectionEnd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Quite concise indeed! We only need to compile it now. We can use the NSIS compiler that will create a <code>hello-world-app-installer.exe</code>.
We can now run the installer and check that our shortcut has been created in the Desktop folder.</p>

<p>Is it done now?</p>

<p><img title=":heavy_check_mark:" alt=":heavy_check_mark:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2714.png" height="20" width="20"> shortcuts have been created<br>
<img title=":heavy_check_mark:" alt=":heavy_check_mark:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2714.png" height="20" width="20"> Installation directory has been created and our executable has been paste inside it<br>
<img title=":x:" alt=":x:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/274c.png" height="20" width="20"> It doesn’t run<br></p>

<p>Indeed, if you try to run the executable, a window should popup with a message like <code>The code execution cannot proceed because LIBPQ.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix the problem.</code>. Which means it’s time to dive into the world of DLLs.</p>

<p>But wait something’s strange. When we executed our program earlier, it was working fine. So what happened meanwhile?<br>
Well, the reason it worked before was that we prefixed the command with <code>stack exec</code> which made sure the executable would find its required dependencies.</p>

<p>We can verify this quite easily.
Let’s copy our executable in a place we can access more easily first: <code>stack install</code>. <br>
For me it copied the executable here: <code>C:\Users\iori\AppData\Roaming\local\bin</code>.<br></p>

<p>Let’s cd inside this folder and run our executable without prefixing it with <code>stack exec</code>. We should see the same error message popping up.</p>

<p>Time to fix this by making sure our executable knows where to find the DLLs it depends on.</p>



<p><code>DLL</code> (dynamic link library) is our runtime dependencies. In our case, because we use <code>postgresql-simple</code>, our project requires some postgresql DLLs that we need to find.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-required-dll">Finding the required DLL</h2>

<p>Many tools can help you list dependencies on windows like <a href="https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies">Dependencies</a> or even <code>ldd</code> if you have <a href="https://cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> installed.
I chose to go with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Process explorer</a> which can show the dependency of a running process.</p>

<p>So let’s run our project with: <code>stack exec hello-world-app-exe</code>
Then we should find our instance in Process explorer.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.patchgirl.io/assets/img/process-explorer.png" alt="test"></p>

<p>By clicking <strong>View</strong> -&gt; <strong>DLL</strong>, we can list our program DLLs. We don’t need to take care of the DLLs that are in the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>.
On the other hand, we see that our executable requires 5 postgresql DLL: <em>libpq</em>, <em>libcrypto</em>, <em>libiconv</em>, <em>libintl</em> and <em>libssl</em>.
Those are the DLLs we want for our program. So we can simply copy them into the root folder of our executable and now, running our program without prefixing with <code>stack exec</code> should work fine! <img title=":fireworks:" alt=":fireworks:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f386.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>So are we done now? Not quite so, we still need to update the installer to take the DLLs into account.</p>

<h2 id="copying-dlls-with-nsis">Copying DLLs with NSIS</h2>

<p>We could copy them one by one with <code>File myDll.dll</code> but because we might have a lot of them, let’s just put all our assets into a folder and copy that folder:</p>

<pre><code>section "install"
	setOutPath $INSTDIR

    file "assets\"

    ...
sectionEnd
</code></pre>

<p>We can then, put our DLLs, icon, and executable into the assets/ folder and Now we are truly done! <img title=":sparkler:" alt=":sparkler:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f387.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="really-is-this-the-end">Really? Is this the end?</h2>

<p>Well, this post was intended to be simple but actually, you shouldn’t stop here. You should add to your installer an uninstaller that will take care of removing all the folders/files, shortcuts, and whatnot.</p>

<p>I invite you to read NSIS documentation for that <img title=":blue_book:" alt=":blue_book:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4d8.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>This example is available in the repo <a href="https://github.com/patchgirl/windows-haskell-installer-example">patchgirl/windows-haskell-installer-example</a></p>



<p>For a simple case like this one, writing an installer isn’t too hard. If you don’t need shortcuts/icons and would satisfy with a simple executable that you can run from a terminal, you might want to investigate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed">file-embed</a> to embed any files (picture, documentation,…) within your executable</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://vrom911.github.io/blog/github-actions-releases">Vrom911 blog post</a> to generate executable from Github Action for MacOS/Windows/Linux</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/">Haskell.nix</a> to cross-compile your Haskell project with Nix</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I haven’t tried it but there exists a Haskell package called <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nsis">nsis</a> which provides a more concise DSL to build your script.</p>

<p>I hope this article helps you write more Haskell on Windows!!</p>

  <p>Should we forbid personalised advertisement to gain back our attention, our data, our digital selves? Should we completely break the underlying economic machinery that fuels companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google?  I think the answer to that has to be <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>Every now and then I have conversations or read comments about the negative impact of these companies on society. Their business model seems to be diametrical opposite to what we as individuals want. We want to stay in contact, find new friends or jobs, find the right answer to our questions. But they require us to hand over our personal life, be as much engaged with their platforms as possible, and to spent every waking minute acting, reacting, and being influenced. At least to me that doesn’t sound like a preferable nor even acceptable deal. But why is it, that we have this relationship? The answer probably is: “So we become more valuable to their actual users”: Other businesses and as it allegedly seems states. They are paying the bills, they are the ones who drive revenue. The more attention we focus on their products, the longer and more often we can be convinced to buy, vote, or behave. The more data is available about each one of us the better this influence is exercised, because it can be personalized.</p>

<p>But a growing tension between users and platforms seems to be an indicator that we don’t want our attention and data captured. We don’t want to be treated like the product and give a few entities the key to our personality. And I agree. But I disagree when it comes to some of the proposed solutions. Making their business model - personalized advertisement - illegal being one of the more prominent ideas. Or complete disallowing them to collect any data, which results in the same outcome. But to me proponents of these ideas disregard the value of the products too easily. Do you want to life without Google Search or the option to stay in contact with a remote friend through Facebook? I believe these products carry a lot of actual value, but we as users have an asymmetric relationship with them. We are not allowed to become the actual, paying customers. We can use their products without paying money, but we pay the price by being the product.</p>

<p>But why is that? Companies like Google and Facebook are brokerage platforms for attention. That is their main business model. Our attention is offered and someone else is buying it. But for some reason we ourselves cannot be that buyer and these companies don’t show any activity in rectifying our relationship. It seems we, as users of these products, have to claim the right to buy back our attention.</p>

<p>But how would such a right look like?</p>

<h2 id="a-draft-the-right-to-pay">A Draft: The Right to Pay</h2>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Companies that sell data and attention of their users have to provide these users with an option to buy it back in the form of a payed contract that disallows the sale of personalised data and prohibits the inclusion of it in the data and attention bidding process to third parties. It basically reserves the right that users can buy back their digital profiles before it reaches the market.</li>
  <li>The contract also <em>disables notifications and data collection about the user</em> during the use of the product, but it can be enabled by user consent. Access to the product cannot be denied when no consent is given.</li>
  <li>Prices for such user contracts and the right to pay for a service is determined by the prices payed on the brokerage platform run by the company. A distinction can be made between different countries and an update needs to be done periodically, e.g. every year.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-whole-story">The whole story</h3>
<p>Instead of keeping the brokerage side of their business, the core of their business model, closed to a few large buyers it has to be opened up to all their users. They have to provide users with a contract to pay for the services and products they use. At the same time that contract disallows the sale of personalised data and prohibits the inclusion of that person in any attention bidding process. Notifying users and collecting data on them is allowed but disabled by default. A user may still enable it to allow features like personalized recommendation or search to work properly, but it is opt-in. Denial of service when no consent is given is illegal.</p>

<p>That is the basic structure and idea behind a possible legislation that creates a right for us to not be the product. But of course it immediately creates a loophole: Such a contract can be made impractically expensive. Imagine you have to pay 100 USD a month to use Instagram. It is unlikely that anyone will subscribe to such a plan, especially when they can have it virtually for free. But what if that contract doesn’t state a specific price but allows users to bid for his or her own data and attention? Now the price that is being paid correlates to the actual market price of how much my digital me is worth. I can buy myself at market price.</p>

<p>What such a contract looks like in reality is of course unclear. There are many possible ways to construct it. Two potentially interesting ones are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The technically most complex and involved solution would require each user to actually partake in each auctions on him or her, define maximum bid limits and the like. It also requires a brokerage firm like Facebook to handle a significantly larger amount of participants in its trading system. Before it was a limited number of entities interested in such a purchase. Now the number potentially growths to millions of participants in the case of large social networks like Facebook or Instagram. Or billions if this legislation would be applied in most markets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more practical solution is to calculate average yearly attention and data brokerage revenue generated per user in a specific region like a country. I presume they are producing comparable statistics already to gauge their business development and therefore having these numbers should come at a low cost. The cost for a user contract then is such a number. Let us assume Instagram in 2020 earned 20 USD per user per year in the US on average. In that case the right for a US user to buy back his or her attention and data is 20 USD for the next year 2021.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I personally think that a version of the latter is the way forward. It is simple for both the companies and users to enact, while still being close to the underlying idea of giving the user access to the brokerage system.</p>

<p>So far so good, but looking closely at the concept we should immediately see another problem: The future development of user data and attention prices after the right is implemented has the potential to break companies like Google or Facebook and our access to their products.</p>

<h3 id="the-impact-of-future-data-and-attention-prices-on-companies-survival">The impact of future data and attention prices on companies’ survival</h3>
<p>Obviously there are three ways where the price can go in the long run: up, down, or nowhere, meaning it stays the same. We actually don’t have to predict what will possibly happen to each and every company. Next to being impossible it isn’t required in the first place. We only have to make sure that no matter where these prices go that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Brokerage companies do not end up in a trap created by such a contract so that they will die out eventually.</li>
  <li>User contract prices reach a level which is uneconomical for most individuals and therefore users are forced to accept that their data and attention is sold.</li>
</ol>



<h4 id="prices-go-up">Prices go up</h4>
<p>There can be many different reasons why that happens. Maybe the increased competition on the bidder side also increases the prices. There is less to buy but more demand. In the end, we don’t have to know the exact reason for the increase. We have to understand what the implications are on brokerage companies and users. For brokers it means increased revenue, because bid prices went up and they get a share of it. Users on the other hand have to pay more because their contracts are directly connected to bid prices. All in all revenues and profits of brokerage companies should develop with the price.</p>

<p>But what happens when the user contract prices reach a level where they become uneconomical. What consequence has that in the long run? People start to cancel their payed accounts with services like Instagram and switch to the user-as-a-product model, which cost them no money. But that means a decreasing number of user contracts, less competition, and probably a going back to the current status quo. At some point the user contract becomes attractive again. We would see a cyclic pattern of price swings coupled with users signing payed contracts and then leaving them again. Potentially a stable prices level would establish itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if prices are high based on independent reason the question can be stated: But for how long can that be? To pay significantly more means companies buying data and attention have to spend significantly more. They have to finance it from their revenue. To justify paying more their revenue has to increase, they have to reduce their profits, or run on debt. But as far as I can see it that should not lead to a relative long term price increase for user contract, relative to a user’s income, because it seems like an inflationary process to me.</p>

<h4 id="prices-go-down">Prices go down</h4>
<p>Again we can have many possible scenarios leading to this price development. The most obvious one is a behaviour we see during the early development of social networks: The value of its user’s data and attention growths with the size of the network. You can reach more people and by sheer size increase the chance to reach more of the right people. But decreasing the pool of possible users you can bid on we reverse the economic machinery behind such social networks. The more people buy their data and attention back the smaller the network seems to buyers and therefore holds less value.</p>

<p>Here, the situation is reversed compared to rising prices. Users experience cheaper and cheaper user contracts, which might even attract more to switch, …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a few years since I started writing this blog, and I quite like sharing my thoughts and experiences. After a short while spent on Medium, I decided I wanted to be the sole owner of my content, so I started experimenting with different solutions and ideas. After I finally landed on the “perfect” tech architecture (I know, I’m lying. There’s no perfect solution and Future Me will most likely refactor and (over)re-engineer the current solution), I started to seek the “perfect” writing setup.</p><p>I’m pretty confident I’ve ended up with something worth sharing.</p><h2>A bit about tech stack</h2><p>Before speaking about the setup, I want to spend some words about the tech stack. The site is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/"><strong>Hugo</strong></a>, one of the most popular static site generator. It is a powerful tool that lets you have a website up and running in just a few minutes. With Hugo, you can write articles or content with <strong>Markdown</strong>, and then Markdown pages are automatically transformed into HTML and CSS pages when you build the website. But how Hugo works is not the topic of this article, so if you are interested to know a bit more, I suggest you look over the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">documentation</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, the final output of Hugo is a static website and there are many free solutions to host it. To name a few: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase Hosting</a>. Personally, I’ve always used <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> and I’m still using it. If you have trouble choosing, there is <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/">an entire section on the Hugo doc</a> there to help you.</p><p>For handling the publications, I’ve set up a little <strong>GitHub action</strong> (you can give a look at it <a href="https://github.com/prof18/marcogomiero.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml">on my GitHub</a>) that builds the website and pushes all the changes to a special branch reserved for GitHub Pages. This action is triggered every time I push something on the master branch.</p><p>That’s it for the tech stack. It was a quick but necessary overview to better introduce the context but if you have any kind of question, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p><h2>Writing Setup</h2><p>My main machine is a 15” MacBook Pro - a fantastic tool for my day-to-day job. But after using it for writing some articles, I’ve discovered that a 15” machine is way too heavy, big, and overkill just for blogging.</p><p>When I’m writing something, I like to stay outside in the courtyard, sitting in the deckchair or in the hammock or in a simple chair. And when the weather does not allow it, I prefer to stay on the couch or in bed rather than in my work setup. And in all of these scenarios, my MacBook is too uncomfortable to use. So I started to think about alternatives.</p><p>First of all, I’ve tried to resurrect my old Asus T100HA with a lightweight Linux distro, but in the end I had to drop it due to issues with some drivers and a battery not at its glory anymore. So, after some thinking, I’ve decided to give <strong>iPad</strong> a try: blogging doesn’t require a big screen and CPU power, whereas it does ask for a reliable and comfortable machine, with decent autonomy.</p><p>After some research, I found out that the best compromise between my needs and my budget was the <strong>iPad Air 3</strong> (I made this choice back in May 2020. If it was today, I would choose the new iPad Air 4). For the keyboard, I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch.html">Logitech Combo Touch</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/ipad-overview.jpeg"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/ipad-overview.jpeg"></a></figure><p>To be honest, I quickly fell in love with this Logitech solution. With this keyboard-cover, you will transform the iPad into a notebook. With the kickstand, you can tilt the iPad up to 40 degrees. Then you have a very good trackpad (better than some Window notebooks!), a row of function keys (brightness and volume controls, home button, lock button, spotlight, etc), and backlit keys.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/keyboard-detail.jpeg"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/keyboard-detail.jpeg"></a></figure><p>The only compromise is the fact that it makes the iPad a bit heavier and thicker.</p><h3>Applications</h3><p>As I mentioned above, the website is stored in a git repository and I manage all “the git lifecycle” through <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807?l=en"><strong>Working Copy</strong></a> that I think is the best git client that you can find in the AppStore.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-screen.png" alt="Working Copy"></a><figcaption><p>Working Copy</p></figcaption></figure><p>With Working Copy you can browse the content of the repo but you can also make edits with a built-in editor that also provides the user with syntax highlighting. However, the feature that made me choose this client is the support of the File iOs app, that makes the repositories browsable from other apps too.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-files-app.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-files-app.png" alt="iOs File app"></a><figcaption><p>iOs File app</p></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, I can open and edit an article directly from any Markdown editor - for for the time being my go-to choice is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/mweb-powerful-markdown-app/id1183407767?l=en"><strong>MWeb</strong></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/mweb-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/mweb-screen.png" alt="MWeb"></a><figcaption><p>MWeb</p></figcaption></figure><p>I like it because it provides themes, a powerful preview, a useful toolbar with plenty of quick actions, and a lot of keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>In the past, I’ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pretext/id1347707000?l=en">Pretext</a>, a little bit more basic. In the future, I would like to try <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/ia-writer/id775737172?l=en">iA Writer</a> but it is quite expensive and I don’t know if it’s worth the investment (maybe if there will be a demo or a trial version in the future I can finally make a decision).</p><p>And that’s it! I write an article in MWeb and when I finish it, I publish it on the master branch of the Github repo through Working Client. Then, the GitHub Action is triggered and the article is live.</p><p>Bonus. If I have to edit or prepare an image for an article (like the ones below), I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pixelmator/id924695435?l=en"><strong>Pixelmator</strong></a>, a very good image editor for iOs.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png" alt="Pixelmator"></a><figcaption><p>Pixelmator</p></figcaption></figure><h3>Automations</h3><p>After writing some articles, I’ve discovered that there are some boring activities to achieve on iPad, like creating a new article, adding a new image for an article, etc. So, during one of the “its-blogging-time-but-i-dont-want-to-write” sessions (procrastination FTW) I decided to automate some of these boring things.</p><h4>Add an image to an article</h4><p>To show an image on a Hugo Markdown page, it is necessary to write a shortcode; for example, for the Pixelmator’s screen posted above the corresponding shortcode is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="markdown">{{<span>&lt;</span> <span>figure</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"</span>  <span>link</span><span>=</span><span>"/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"</span> <span>caption</span><span>=</span><span>"Pixelmator"</span> <span>&gt;</span>}}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>So, every time I need to add an image to an article, I need to:</p><ol><li>Create a folder into the img folder of the website (if not present. I create a folder for every article just to keep things clean);</li><li>Move the image from the iPad gallery to the folder created above;</li><li>Rename the image with a more readable format;</li><li>Write the shortcode for the image in the article.</li></ol><p>Way too many steps for a lazy person like me!</p><p>To try to automate these steps, I started playing with the <strong>Apple Shortcuts iOS app</strong>. If you’ve never heard about it, I suggest you take a peek. It’s really powerful and it can greatly simplify your life.</p><blockquote><p>A shortcut is a quick way to get one or more tasks done with your apps. The Shortcuts app lets you create your own shortcuts with multiple steps. For example, build a “Surf Time” shortcut that grabs the surf report, gives an ETA to the beach, and launches your surf music playlist. <em><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios">Shortcuts user guide</a></em></p></blockquote><p>After some trials, I was able to achieve my goal and, as you can see in the video, when I need to add an image to an article I can launch a shortcut that does all the job for me.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MdSv-PwC5N8" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>Here’s the “source code” of the shortcut:</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-image-shortcut.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-image-shortcut.png" alt="iOs shortcut to move an image from the camera roll to the repo of the site and generate the Hugo shortcode"></a><figcaption><p>iOs shortcut to move an image from the camera roll to the repo of the site and generate the Hugo shortcode</p></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the image above, it is possible to ask for input and then store it in a variable. So, first of all, I receive as input the name of the image and the folder, then I open the system image picker and I store the chosen image in a variable. Then, before moving the image, I extract the file extension of the image and store it in another variable.
And now finally, it is time to move the image to the specific folder with the new name. This action is performed with the shortcut support provided by Working Copy. And at the end, I create the shortcode for the specific image and I store it in the clipboard ready to be pasted in the article.</p><h4>Create a new article draft</h4><p>Another boring activity is the creation of a new article. That’s because for every article I need to write some metadata at the top, like the date, the title, etc.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="markdown">---
layout: post
title:  "Running a blog with iPad"
date:   2021-01-01
show_in_homepage: false
draft: true
tags: [Blogging]
---
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>So, I made another shortcut!</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v18imNIwgyc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>And here’s the “source code” of this shortcut:</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-article-draft-shortcut.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-article-draft-shortcut.png" alt="iOs shortcut to create a new article draft with some metadata"></a><figcaption><p>iOs shortcut to create a new article draft with some metadata</p></figcaption></figure><p>The structure is very similar to the other shortcut. First of all, I make sure that I’m in the develop branch of the website where I make all the draft work. Next, I ask for some input that I store in some variables. As you can see it is also possible to do some if/else statements.
And at the end, I create the metadata that will be placed inside the new article.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>And that’s how I write in my blog. I’m very happy with this setup because it let me only focus on writing. Every “boring” activity is completely automated and in this way, I have “just” to write. And by using an iPad I’m not tempted to re-open my IDE to procrastinate writing.</p><p>If you have any kind of suggestions about apps, accessories, whatever, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Over the past 3.5 years my career has grown and transformed from Individual Contributor (IC) to an Engineering Manager of multiple teams, and all the roles in between as I built the Azure Sphere Security Services (AS3) Team from 2 people to 20 people.&nbsp; I undertook this journey in the Summer of 2017 to help transform a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/project-sopris-iot-security/">Microsoft Research project, Project Sopri</a>s, into a Generally Available (GA) product <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/">Azure Sphere</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the AS3 Team grew, I went through a massive amount of personal growth and learning as well.&nbsp; In December 2017 I stepped into a manager role for the first time in my career.&nbsp; I had been a professional software engineer for over a decade at this point, and was up for a totally new challenge.&nbsp; I knew that the skills and job of growing and managing a team and then an organization were totally different than what I had been actively developing over the last decade of my career.&nbsp; As I went through this period of growth I was lucky enough to have several friends, coaches, and mentors share their experiences with me, and recommend some great books to help me along my learning journey.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Below is my curated list of the most influential and impactful books that helped me along the way, and that I highly recommend to Engineering Managers&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth &amp; Change by Camille Fournier</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BHEtpF4eL._SY346_.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="450"></figure></div>



<p>This is a must read for anyone considering managing engineering teams, it is as good as or better than the hype surrounding it.&nbsp; The book starts off from the individual contributor perspective and then each subsequent chapter explores the next level of management complexity.&nbsp; Each chapter focuses on an engineering management role, like technical lead, manager of people, or manager of multiple teams, and manager of managers.</p>



<p>Over the past 3.5 years I’ve come back to this book several times, re-reading the chapters around my newest role.&nbsp; For instance when I transitioned into a manager of managers role, I re-read that chapter and the one before and after it.&nbsp; These were great reminders on what I should be focused on, what challenges my directs were facing, and what challenges and motivations my boss was focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the sections I really loved was on debugging dysfunctional teams.&nbsp; As an engineer I am a great debugger, often able to piece together logs, metrics, and weird behavior to diagnose what’s going wrong in a system.&nbsp; This was the first time I had seen the term debugging applied to people and organizations, and it helped frame the work of how to start investigating dysfunction in a team, and how to discover the source of the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honestly I recommend this book to every engineer, solely for the chapter on how to be managed, and what you should and can expect from your manager.&nbsp; Even if you never plan on taking on a management role this book provides an excellent overview of the challenges and motivations of folks in varying levels of an engineering organization and will help you better navigate your org.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Thanks for the Feedback by Douglas Stone &amp; Sheila Heen</h2>



<p>Prior to managing I had given peer feedback as part of performance reviews at various companies, but I did not consider this a strength of mine.&nbsp; Now giving feedback was a critical skill for my role as a manager.&nbsp; Early on I sought out several resources on how to give and receive feedback well, and found “Thanks for the Feedback” to be an tremendous resource.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blackwells.co.uk/jacket/l/9780670922635.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="512"></figure></div>



<p>Thanks for the Feedback is framed as a resource for receiving and processing the multitudes of feedback you receive.&nbsp; However, any one who reads this book, will also learn how to be a more skilled feedback giver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I highly recommend reading the book in its entirety, but I wanted to share one of the fundamental ideas in this book that resonated with me.&nbsp; Feedback is really three different things, with three different purposes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Appreciation</strong>,&nbsp; the goal is to help people feel appreciated.&nbsp; Sometimes they may just need motivation and encouragement to keep going when tackling tough problems</li><li><strong>Coaching</strong>, the goal is to help the receiver expand their knowledge, sharpen skills, and increase confidence.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Evaluation,</strong> the goal here is to rate or rank the receiver’s work against a set of standards to align expectations and inform decision making.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This idea that feedback serves a variety of different purposes was eye opening, and help me more clearly think about how and when to provide feedback.&nbsp; Taking this perspective along with the multitude of lessons learned from this book was tremendously helpful to me.</p>



<h2>The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz</h2>



<div><figure><a href="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="2057" data-permalink="https://caitiem.com/image-1/" data-orig-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg" data-orig-size="1752,2560" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=205" data-large-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=701" src="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=701" alt="" width="251" height="367" srcset="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=251 251w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=502 502w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=103 103w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=205 205w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The book starts off acknowledging a problem with most management books “they attempt to provide a recipe for challenges that have no recipes.&nbsp; There’s no recipe for really complicated, dynamic situations.”&nbsp; This instantly resonated with me as I was reading it in November 2019.&nbsp; I had been a manager for about two years, and had grown the AS3 team from 2 to 15 people.&nbsp; We’d spent the past two years turning a research project into what would soon be a GA’d product in February 2020.&nbsp; There is no recipe for how to do this, what I was doing was a hard thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horowitz packs the book with a variety of entertaining stories from his career as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur to emphasize his message and points on leadership and various challenges.&nbsp; In addition there are a few key takeaways that have stayed with me.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Take care of the people, the product, and the profits in that order</strong>.&nbsp; This quote resonated with me and the kind of organization I want to build and run.&nbsp; Chapter 5, which bears this quote as a title goes into some of the challenges that can arise when setting out with this mission and how to overcome them, like hiring, training, and management debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Part of Management is training your people.</strong> In big companies this is often neglected as it’s the role of HR or corporate to produce training programs.&nbsp; These can sometimes be valuable but are often overly generic.&nbsp; As a manager make sure you are training your people for the specific job they are doing.&nbsp; Things like how to work in your specific code base, what are the architectural standards and guidelines, what makes a good design doc, etc…Make sure you are intentionally designing on boarding programs, meetings, and workshops to facilitate learning.</li></ul>



<h2>Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Accelerate_3D_Shingo-e1567716184319.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="473"></figure></div>



<p>Accelerate is a summary of the research and learnings discovered by Dr Forsgren and her colleagues from the 2014-2017 State of DevOps report.&nbsp; This book is a must read for any engineering leader, as it gives you a clear outline on how to set your team up for success by investing in 24 key capabilities which will drive improvement in your teams software delivery performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some non-surprising findings like using version control is important to team performance, and other not so obvious ones like focusing on continuous integration and software delivery performance positively impacts culture.</p>



<p>This book and the ongoing research released by Dr. Forsgren, et. Al has had a huge influence on the priorities of my team.&nbsp; We embraced Accelerate principles early on in the development of the Azure Sphere Security Services, and that investment has paid huge dividends over time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dare to Lead: Brave Work.&nbsp; Tough Conversations.&nbsp; Whole Hearts. by Brene Brown</h2>



<p>I’m a huge fan of Brene Brown’s work as a shame and vulnerability researcher.&nbsp; In October 2018 she released Dare to Lead applying her research to Leadership.&nbsp; This quote sums up why this book is important</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780399592522-us.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="520"></figure></div>



<p>“There’s an old saying that I lead by now: “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Brene Brown</p>



<p>This book dives into what it takes to become a brave and courageous leader.&nbsp; Spoiler a lot of it involves embracing vulnerability and living authentically, something that is far easier to say than do.&nbsp; The book defines vulnerability as “the emotion we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure…Vulnerability is not winning or losing.&nbsp; It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.”</p>



<p>One section I continually return to is the definitions of the two leadership styles: armored leadership and daring leadership.&nbsp; Brown’s research uncovered 16 traits for each of these leadership styles and breaks each one of them down.&nbsp; I highly recommend going through these periodically and checking in on your own leadership style and where there is room for growth and improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another great exercise that Brown presents in the book is one around values.&nbsp; She challenges readers to pick one to two core values, not ten or fifteen, because as Jim Collins said “If you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities.”&nbsp; Having clarity around your core values allows you to live and lead more authentically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall this book is one of the best for dealing with the “soft skills” of leadership.&nbsp; How do you show up whole heartedly and help create a team that can do the same is one of the biggest challenges of taking on a management role.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QxTfW8-PL.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="511"></figure></div>



<p>This book is an awesome resource for understanding the psychology and sociology behind what motivates people and how to be successful enacting change from small to epic scale.  I loved this book as it provides real practical tips for how to enact change across a team or organization through researched principles and real world examples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book starts by acknowledging that people have both emotional and rational sides, and motivating each is important for effective change.&nbsp; In engineering orgs we often only motivate the rationale side, because the analytical brain is all important.&nbsp; Sometimes …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

      <p>For those who do not know, having a clipboard history is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<p>It is that little feature that allows you, after you made a few copy actions (ctrl+c on Windows or command-c on Mac), to choose any of the copied texts to paste it.</p>

<p>It looks like this when I use <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, a productivity tool on Mac, by pression option-command-c (the three buttons at once).</p>

<p><img src="https://multitasked.net/uploads/2021/302b4c92a6.png" width="480" height="451" alt=""></p>

<p>Just click on the text you want, and it will be copied wherever your cursor happened to be.</p>

<p>You can even search in your clipboard history for something you copied a few days before, as in this screenshot.
<img src="https://multitasked.net/uploads/2021/394bad9b53.png" width="480" height="451" alt=""></p>

<p>This feature is a huge time saver. There is a lot of alternative apps providing this feature and apparently, it’s now a standard part of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/671222/how-to-enable-and-use-clipboard-history-on-windows-10/">Windows 10 too</a>.</p>

<p>Remember all these times where you have to copy a few distinct cells from an Excel file to insert them in a report, and how you switch constantly between the documents? With this feature, you can just copy one by one all the cells that you want, switch to your report (only once!), and paste one by one the values you needed.</p>

<p>Or, are you looking for that email address you sent yesterday? Just open your clipboard history, type a few letters of the name of the person, and there you go, it’s here. You don’t have to open your emails, perform a search, it is just right there, and it very often allows you to stay focused on your current task.</p>

<p>So, you get it, I love it. You should use it. I know I sound like a cheesy salesman here, but that is how convinced I am.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><strong><em>This is the second part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to the explanation of how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap:</strong> <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">In the first part</a>, I’ve described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to rewrite it in Python. It is an <strong>explanatory rewrite</strong> dedicated to uncovering the knowledge behind the Hunspell by “translating” it into a high-level language, with a lot of comments.</p>

<p>Now, let’s dive into how the stuff really works!</p>

<p>There are two main parts of word-by-word spellchecker algorithms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if a word is correct: <strong>“lookup”</strong> part</li>
  <li>Propose the correction for incorrect words: <strong>“suggest”</strong> part</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hunspell also implements several other algorithms to be useful as standalone software. It can extract plain text from numerous formats, like HTML or TeX, split it into words (tokenize), correctly handling punctuation—but at the end of the day, a word-by-word correctness check is applied. I excused myself from implementing “wrapper” algorithms: text extraction and tokenization are thoroughly investigated topics, and there are numerous libraries in any language solving it with decent speed and quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell works on a word-by-word basis (no context is taken into account). Each word is just <strong>looked up</strong> in the <strong>dictionary</strong> loaded from the plaintext  <code>&lt;langname&gt;.dic</code> file in Hunspell-specific format. If it is not considered correct by dictionary lookup (which, as we’ll see soon, is more complex than “is it present in the dictionary”), several algorithms of <strong>suggest</strong> are applied sequentially, trying to find correct words similar to the given one.</p>

<h2 id="hunspells-lookup-algorithm-or-just-look-in-the-dictionary-they-said">Hunspell’s lookup algorithm, or, Just look in the dictionary, they said!</h2>

<p>When coming from English-only spellchecking, the developers tend to perceive the “lookup” part as trivial (e.g., the famous <a href="https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">Peter Norvig’s article</a> starts from the assumption that only the correction—”suggest”—part deserves some explanations). But that’s not quite so.</p>

<p>The first and most straightforward idea<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for the lookup would be: we’ll just take the dictionary (presumably, the flat list of all correct words) and look for our candidate word in this list: if it is there, it is correct. End of story.</p>

<p>Now, Hunspell’s dictionaries exist for many languages and have a plaintext format, which, at the first sight is quite close to a plain word list—so, probably it would be easy to reuse them? Let’s take a look into the <a href="https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/blob/master/en/en_US.dic"><code>en_US.dic</code></a> in the LibreOffice dictionary repository. You’ll see a list of words in the following format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
acetyl
acetylene/M
ache/DSMG
achene/MS
achievable/U
achieve/BLZGDRS
achievement/SM
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The line <code>ache/DSMG</code> specifies the <em>stem</em> <code>ache</code>, having <code>D</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>G</code> <em>flags</em> associated with it. The meaning of flags is defined by <a href="https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/blob/master/en/en_US.aff"><code>en_US.aff</code></a> (called “affix file”, or just aff-file; every Hunspell dictionary is distributed as a pair of <code>.dic</code> and <code>.aff</code> files).</p>

<h3 id="affix-compression">Affix compression</h3>

<p>In this particular case, all four flags are associated with word <em>suffixes</em>. Here’s the definition of <code>D</code> suffix:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SFX D Y 4                    # Suffix header: suffix (SFX), with flag D, combinable with prefixes (Y), 4 entries:
SFX D   0  d    e            # * if the stem ends is "e", strip nothing (0), and add "d"
SFX D   y  ied  [^aeiou]y    # * if the stem ends with "y", preceded by non-vowel, strip "y" and add "ied"
SFX D   0  ed   [^ey]        # * if the stem ends with not "e", and not "y", strip nothing, add "ed"
SFX D   0  ed   [aeiou]y     # * "y" with preceding vowel: strip nothing, add "ed"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For our <code>ache</code> stem, this definition says that form <code>ached</code> exists. In the similar fashion, <code>S</code> flag defines that word <code>aches</code> exists, <code>G</code> flag defines <code>aching</code>, <code>M</code> flag defines <code>ache's</code>. So, the <code>ache/DSMG</code> line in <code>.dic</code> file specifies 5 correct words: “ache”, “ached”, “aches”, “aching”, “ache’s”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the fact that flags are similar to the suffixes they define (<code>S</code> flag defines suffix <code>-s</code> and so on) is just a convention. It is rather a handy mnemonics that creators of <code>en_US</code> dictionary used, and there could be any other symbol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the similar fashion, word prefixes might be defined (specified with flags in dic-file, and described with <code>PFX</code> directive in aff-file). Say, this definition:</p>



<p>…defines these forms: <em>advantage, advantage’s, advantaging, advantaged, advantages, disadvantage’s, disadvantaging, disadvantaged, disadvantages, disadvantage</em> (all combinations of four suffixes and a prefix “dis-“).</p>

<p>This technique of “packing” dictionaries is called <strong>affix compression</strong>, and its primary goal is to optimize dictionary size: on disk and in memory. It becomes extremely important for languages with rich inflection. For example, in English one stem might produce no more than ten forms, but in Ukrainian it could easily be dozens or even hundreds, so the amount of possible correct forms quickly grows to tens of millions. “Just a flat list of all known words” <em>might</em> become impractical (not on today’s top MacBook, probably, but still), and that’s where the affix compression comes in handy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not the only possible approach to make dictionary storage more effective: for example, <a href="https://github.com/morfologik/morfologik-stemming">morfologik</a> (the default internal spellchecker of the most widely used open-source proofreading software <a href="https://languagetool.org/">LanguageTool</a>) codes <em>all</em> possible forms in binary files, using finite-state automata. And this approach is very efficient by speed and memory, but very hard for humans to edit and review, and thus, to keep dictionary up-to-date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another benefit of splitting words into stems and affixes: when Hunspell’s user wants to add a new word to their personal dictionary, Hunspell allows to just specify “it is inflected the same way as (some other word)”, thus sparing the user of teaching the dictionary “‘monad’ is a word, and ‘monads’ too, as well as ‘monad’s’…”.</p>

<p>Note, though, that “suffixes” and “prefixes” specified in some language’s dictionary not necessarily correspond to <em>grammatical</em> suffixes/prefixes of the language. The splitting into stems and affixes is deduced automatically by dictionary authoring tools from flat word lists, so it is up to probabilities whether “common endings” deduced have any grammatical meaning. Actually, Hunspell’s format has a rich <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/libhunspell-dev/hunspell.5.en.html#Optional_data_fields">sub-language to specify grammatical information</a>, but of all LibreOffice and Firefox dictionaries I’ve checked, only a few (Latvian, Slovak, Galician, Breton) made use of this feature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One important factor to mention is Hunspell’s limitation for the amount of suffixes/prefixes a word may have. Currently, the software understands no more than 2 suffixes and 2 prefixes in a word, which is lower than the common number of grammatical suffixes a lot of languages allow. Most of the dictionaries solve this by “linearizing” the word list: Ukrainian word “громадянство” (citizenship) grammatically consists of the stem “громад-“ and suffixes “-ян-“, “-ств-“, “-о” (the latter is called an ending in grammatically correct terms), but Hunspell’s Ukrainian dictionary includes the full word “громадянство”. For other languages, the suffix number limitation makes Hunspell totally unusable, so to spellcheck the Finnish, you need to install <a href="https://voikko.puimula.org/">Voikko</a> spellchecker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Affix compression comes with a price</strong> paid in lookup algorithm complexity and performance. Instead of just a quick lookup through a hashtable or other lookup-optimized structure, we now have to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the whole word is in the list of stems. If yes, it is correct,
    <ul>
      <li>…unless it has a flag corresponding to the aff-file directive “this stem <em>requires</em> prefixes or suffixes”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If no, check if the word has some of the known suffixes; and if so, whether the stem without one of those suffixes is in the stem list, <em>and</em> has a flag corresponding to this suffix.</li>
  <li>If no, check if one more suffix can be found in the stem (then we’ll have a stem and two suffixes, and need to check the compatibility of their flags).</li>
  <li>Repeat with prefixes (up to two), and with all possible suffix-prefix combination (taking into account whether suffix and prefix both have “cross-product” allowed).</li>
  <li>Consider that suffixes and prefixes can have flags of their own, specifying “suffixes with this flag might be attached after me”, or “if used, this suffix requires that at least one other affix would be present” and … many other things.</li>
  <li>And there are funny cases like <code>CIRCUMFIX</code> flag: if the suffix has it, this means that this suffix is only allowed in words having a prefix with the same flag.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is <em>still</em> a simplified description. To follow the algorithm in full, you can read Spylls docs starting from <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.affix_forms"><code>Lookup.affix_forms</code></a>, follow the links to methods it invokes, and read inline comments under “Show code”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance-wise, for each word correctness check, there could be many lookups through known suffixes and prefixes lists, and quite a few dictionary lookups (as consecutive chopping off of suffixes and prefixes produces new stems we need to check).</p>

<p>And once you tackle the affixes problem, it is all uphill from there!</p>

<blockquote><p>One day in Spring 1989, I was sitting out on the Lucid porch with some of the hackers, and someone asked me why I thought people believed C and Unix were better than Lisp. I jokingly answered, “because, well, worse is better.” We laughed over it for a while as I tried to make up an argument for why something clearly lousy could be good.</p><cite><a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html</a></cite></blockquote>







<p><a href=""></a>It has long been wondered why Java took the crown for the ‘enterprise’ language. I can’t really argue on that topic since I came onto the scene long after Java was all there was. This article is about why software leviathans are written in Java more than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have a huge software project to build. What language do you build it in? The prototype was written in ruby on rails by one guy and an Adderal prescription. Now they want you to scale this thing to a 1000+ engineers over 5 years of development. You might think “aha this is my chance, lets save an order of magnitude lines of code and use lisp”, except this story happened in the past and they chose Java.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is it always Java? Sure it’s reasonably fast, but Facebook made PHP work, can’t we at least use Haskell? Since we have the benefit of hindsight, we know that most of the biggest software systems are built in Java. Google built so many leviathans in Java that they bankrolled a new language like Java but with less features. Amazon is based on Java. Netflix is java again. Facebook made their own language and Microsoft is old enough to have existed before Java, but still made their own version of Java, C#.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real question should be, “What is Java’s secret?”.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Java requires a lot of boiler plate</em></strong></p>



<p>Java just plays well with the major constraints in a software leviathan and at Leviathan scale that is all that matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This one is the corollary of “Java doesn’t support meta-programming”. Creating your own DSL is great, 1000 engineers creating their own DSL is 999 nightmares. Software Leviathans are too big for any one engineering team to understand. Any DSL you create makes your code unintelligible to the rest of the people working in hell with you. I can understand boilerplate written by a monkey, but a DSL written by another software engineer could take me days to understand. When your team gets poached to go work on a startup where the code base isn’t humongous, it’s a lot easier to bring in Java programmers to replace you lot than it would be to get Haskell engineers to figure out your undocumented dialect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google got to the point where they figured Java had too much meta-programming ability so they created Go which is basically Java without inheritance. That is what happens when you work in a leviathan project. You begin to resent the ability of your peers to do anything unusual, because you know it’s just going to be more work for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding more onboarding time to understand 1) the functional language and 2) the DSL your team created might push our already long 6 month on-boarding period closer to the 1 year mark. I wrote an article about onboarding time and functional languages aimed at startups, but honestly I don’t think the hiring market is the real reason Java dominates the top end. FAANG is already willing to train new grads to work on their giant software projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It boils down to comprehension honestly. Humans can only comprehend so many things and at leviathan scale the max is a tiny fraction of the entire system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a software leviathan your team constantly works with other teams’ systems. How does this API work? There isn’t any documentation and one 30 minute office hours isn’t going to explain that hair ball. If you all use the same language and that language is Java there is a chance you can open up their code base and figure out what is going on. They probably didn’t do anything you wouldn’t expect like pre-allocating all of their memory and storing all objects into a ring buffer. But if they did do something crazy you can probably figure it out. Besides Java doesn’t have anything like Scalaz so you won’t be surprised by a functor where you weren’t expecting it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lets take the opposite side, away team work. You have been given the glorious task of implementing a new feature. But it’s impossible to do it cleanly without an API change in another team’s system. That team fully supports the change and has contributed 2 paragraphs to your architecture document describing the change to make in their system. But the change isn’t on their team’s roadmap so you are going to have to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting their service to run and pass integration tests in your virtual development machine takes a week. Now you need to navigate their system where they have conveniently used dependency injection to ensure that you can’t know which of the 5 implementations of this interface is in play. Do you still wish the other team could use Clojure? You might never figure out the DSL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have you ever looked at somebody else’s Lisp code and wondered what was inside the variables? Now imagine this is your job and you will spend the next month making a 200 line change to a 100,000 line of code API service you didn’t know existed until this week. Except this will happen every quarter for the rest of your career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People complain about how Java forces you to write the type of things everywhere, but for software leviathans this is a benefit. I can see helpful type signatures everywhere, whether I’m reading your code in my IDE, an email, an excerpt in an arch doc, or in a Slack message you sent me at 3 am.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Java and Go are great in Software Leviathans. You don’t have to worry about stumbling upon a programming mystery created 10 years ago by a disgruntled new grad. You can expect a consistent syntax and language whichever microservice you are working on. The code has self-documenting types that are ‘easy’ to understand. Honestly, they are a lot of benefits which make a tough coding environment a little more manageable.</p>

<h2 id="import-assertions">Import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The motivating use case for import assertions was importing JSON data as a module. That looks as follows (and is further specified in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules">a separate proposal</a>):</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<p>You may wonder why a JavaScript engine can’t use the filename extension <code>.json</code> to determine that this is JSON data. However, a core architectural principle of the web is to never use the filename extension to determine what’s inside a file. Instead, content types are used.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a risk of doing importing wrong if a server has incorrectly configured content types. Specifying the necessary metadata at the import location solves this issue.</p>
<p>Before we take a more detailed look at how import assertions work, let’s examine the history of importing non-JavaScript artifacts in the world of JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="history%3A-importing-non-javascript-artifacts-as-modules">History: importing non-JavaScript artifacts as modules&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Importing artifacts that are not JavaScript code as modules, has a long tradition in the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, the JavaScript module loader RequireJS has support for so-called <a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/plugins.html"><em>plugins</em></a>. To give you a feeling for how old RequireJS is: Version 1.0.0 was released in 2009. Specifiers of modules that are imported via a plugin look like this:</p>
<pre><code>'«specifier-of-plugin-module»!«specifier-of-artifact»'
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the following module specifier imports a file as JSON:</p>
<pre><code>'json!./data/config.json'
</code></pre>
<p>Inspired by RequireJS, webpack supports the same module specifier syntax for its <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/"><em>loaders</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-for-importing-non-javascript-artifacts">Use cases for importing non-JavaScript artifacts&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>These are a few use cases for importing non-JavaScript artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing JSON configuration data</li>
<li>Importing WebAssembly code as if it were a JavaScript module</li>
<li>Importing CSS to build user interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>For more use cases, you can take a look at <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/">the list of webpack’s loaders</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-syntax-of-import-assertions">The syntax of import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Let’s examine in more detail what import assertions look like.</p>
<h3 id="static-import-statements">Static import statements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We have already seen a normal (static) import statement:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<p>The import assertions start with the keyword <code>assert</code>. That keyword is followed by an object literal. For now, the following object literal features are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unquoted keys and quoted keys</li>
<li>The values must be strings</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other syntactic restrictions placed on the keys and the values, but engines are encouraged to throw an exception if they don’t support a key and/or a value. That makes it easier to add more features in the future because no one will use keys and values in unexpected ways.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-imports">Dynamic imports&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>To support import assertions, <a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_modules.html#import-operator">dynamic imports</a> get a second parameter – an object with configuration data:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span>(<span>'./data/config.json'</span>, { <span>assert</span>: { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> } })
</code></pre>
<p>The import assertions don’t exist at the top level; they are specified via the property <code>assert</code>. That makes it possible to add more configuration options in the future.</p>
<h3 id="re-export-statements">Re-export statements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A re-export imports and exports in a single step. For the former, we need assertions:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> { <span>default</span> <span>as</span> config } <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<h2 id="upcoming-features-based-on-import-assertions">Upcoming features based on import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Import assertions are really just syntax. They lay the foundation for actual features that make use of that syntax.</p>
<p>The first feature based on import assertions is probably going to be <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules">JSON modules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-webassembly">Importing WebAssembly&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Whether or not import assertions will be used to support directly importing WebAssembly from JavaScript is currently under <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions/issues/19">discussion</a>. If they are used, we’ll probably be able to create web workers like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>new</span> Worker(<span>'my-app.wasm'</span>, { <span>type</span>: <span>'module'</span>, <span>assert</span>: { <span>type</span>: <span>'webassembly'</span> } })
</code></pre>
<p>And we’d also need import assertions in HTML script elements:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"my-app.wasm"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span> <span>asserttype</span>=<span>"webassembly"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am going to begin with some practical things that I have taken away from
NeurIPS this year. Careful setup and proper tuning of your models can make
a big difference in performance. An amazing example of this are Steffen
Rendle’s currently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01395">SOTA results</a> for
recommender ratings predictions on the Movielens 10M dataset, where a well
tuned baseline is able to <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/collaborative-filtering-on-movielens-10m">beat years of
research</a>
on the topic.</p><h2>Bag of tricks</h2><p>Of course, setup and proper tuning is hard, so knowing current tricks for
particular architectures, as well as how to combine them all together, is
super useful.  There are several bag of tricks summary papers that I know of
for CNNs <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, and I would love to hear about more. I found two more
promising methods at NeurIPS this year that I will definitely try out.</p><h3>Curriculum by Smoothing</h3><div><p>Note</p><div><p>Suddenly, I found myself implementing convolutions in javascript. Anything to avoid writing? Use the slider to see the effect of annealing the standard deviation on the kernel and image.</p><figure><figcaption>Slide me 🤔 <span> <!-- -->0.40</span></figcaption></figure><figure><canvas height="181" width="246"></canvas><figcaption>Fig 1. Dürer's Rhinoceros</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Curriulum learning is the idea of breaking a learning task down into units of
progressively increasing difficulty, which is pretty much how humans learn.
Curriculum by Smoothing <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> by Sinha et al proposes to apply this idea to CNN
training. During early training, filters learned by the CNN will include
high frequency data in the produced feature maps. These are details at very
small scales. To illustrate the type of information we are talking about,
let’s take a brief look at JPG compression:</p><blockquote><p>Human vision has a drop-off at higher frequencies, and de-emphasizing (or
even removing completely) higher frequency data from an image will give an
image that appears very different to a computer, but looks very close to the
original to a human. The quantization stage uses this fact to remove high
frequency information, which results in a smaller representation of the
image. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>As it turns out, removing high frequency information during early training
makes the learning problem easier. In this paper, high frequency data is
removed at the beginning of training, and is exponentially annealed such that
by the end of the training process, we are training on the original feature
maps.</p><p>Annealing is done by reducing the variance of the gaussian kernel. This makes
the gaussian more peaky and reduces the smoothing effect, until in the extreme
case the kernel will have no effect at all. Have a play with the sidenote to
see the effect.</p><p>The numbers presented in the paper look great 👏🏽. A resnet-18 baseline
trained on imagenet obtains 68% top-1 accuracy, while using this training
method the authors obtain 71% top-1 accuracy. Have a look at the paper for
more details on transfer learning performance.</p><p>This work was done at the University of Toronto pair lab, and the github code

here</a>.</p><h3>Hyperparameter search with ensembles of optimizers</h3><div><p>Note</p><p>These optimisers use gaussian processes to model your metric over the parameter space. The framework for this is to loop over a suggest - observe cycle as many times as your budget allows for:</p><ul><li>get suggestions from your optimiser</li><li>observe result and update model</li></ul><p>Observations can be done in parallelized batches.</p><p><em>Ensembling of two optimisers can be done as follows: take half of the observations from each optimiser, and use them to update the other optimiser.</em></p></div><p>I have never gotten far past random search when it comes to automated tuning
of hyperparameters. I suppose that effective hyperparameter tuning continues
to be a matter of experience <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, hat tip to Henry from
<a href="https://www.dragonfly.co.nz/">dragonfly</a> for pointing out this paper.</p><p>Nevertheless, I always wondered what some of the cloud hyperparameter tuning
offerings cloud could do. Thanks to the <a href="https://bbochallenge.com/">NeurIPS black box optimization
challenge</a>, which ran as part of the competitions
programme, I might have something new to try out myself instead. Results can
be seen on the leaderboard, along with papers and code for some of the
contestants.</p><p>My main takeaway is that large improvements could be made to off-the-shelf
black box optimisers through ensembling of readily available open source
implementations. This paper by Nvidia RAPIDS <sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> found that combining
<a href="https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO">Turbo</a> with either
<a href="https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt">Hyperopt</a> or <a href="https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/">Scikit
Optimize</a> yielded good results.</p><h2>Accountability</h2><div><p>Note</p><p>The firing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timnit_Gebru">Timnit Gebru</a> from Google overshadowed the positive developments at NeurIPS. This <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">article</a> by technology review summarises the situation. I hope Timnit can continue to make a positive impact somewhere more thankful.</p><p>In the meantime, Google could spend some time <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932">searching inside itself</a>.</p></div><p>For me, this was the year that the broader impact of AI is truly being seen
and addressed by the community. You can’t just hide out in your workplace,
tuning hyperparameter while ignoring developments in the world at large. This

time:</p><blockquote><p>Successful technological fields have a moment when they become pervasive,
important, and noticed. They are deployed into the world and, inevitably,
something goes wrong. … The field must then choose to mature and take
responsibility for avoiding the harms associated with what it is producing.
Machine learning has reached this moment.</p></blockquote><p>I do think the tone here is telling, and that many in the field still refuse
to think about their personal accountability. It is something I would like to
think about a lot more in 2021.</p><p>Systems out there are already making life changing decisions for potentially
vulnerable people, without providing any path to recourse. However, being able
to explain your predictions is an important part of providing recourse for
your system.</p><p>Next up, a tutorial on <a href="https://slideslive.com/38935789/explaining-machine-learning-predictions-stateoftheart-challenges-opportunities">explaining machine learning
predictions</a>.</p><p>Two paths towards explainable systems are to either make the system inherently
explainable, or to provide post hoc explanations of black box systems.</p><h3>Explainable models</h3><div><p>Note</p><p>According to ProPublica, "COMPAS is a proprietary score developed to predict recidivism risk, which is used to inform bail, sentencing and parole decisions and has been the subject of scrutiny for racial bias". See this <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">ProPublica investigation</a> to learn more about COMPAS.</p><p><em>Getting visibility into the these behaviours allows us to change the model to create more fair outcomes. In this case, we could simply remove race from the model. Frankly, this should have been done from the outset.</em></p></div><p>The easiest way to obtain explanations for your model is to start with a model
that is already explainable. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model">Generalised additive
models</a>, described
by Hastie and Tibshirani in the early 90’s, are one such model.  Here is the
formulation for regression:</p><p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Y</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>α</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}(Y|X_1, X_2, ..., X_p) = \alpha + f_1(X_1) + f_2(X_2) + ... + f_p(X_p)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p><p>The functions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be directly inspected after learning.</p><p>This glassbox model has recently popped up in various places, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rcaruana/">Rich

readily interpreted. As an aside, Rich Caruna’s group has brought GAMs into
the world of deep learning <sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>, in the hopes of kickstarting research into

defendants are predicted to be higher risk for reoffending than white or Asian
defendants.</p><p>See the paper <sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> for full details.</p></div></div><p>Another method is to train a more powerful black box model, and then to use
model distillation to train a student glassbox explainer model.</p><h3>Post hoc explanations</h3><p>The tutorial was however largely focussed on post hoc explanations.
These treat the model as a black box. Explanations are developed around
usually deep models.</p><p>Post hoc explanations come in two flavours: local and global. Local
explanations seek to exlain single examples, e.g. why a single image was
classified as a wolf. Global explanations seek to explain models in their
aggregate behaviour, e.g. in order to expose systematic bias in the model.</p><p>Local explanations can be understood as zooming into a single example and
looking at the decision boundary closest to that example. One family of local
explanations determines which features are important in the prediction for the
given example.</p><p><em>Lime</em> <sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> seeks to generate a sparse linear approximation of the local
decision boundary. As many features as possible are zeroed out in order to
identify the important dimensions, and the regression encodes the relative
importance of those remaining features. This way, we can determine which
features are important in the prediction for the given example.</p><figure><p><svg width="180" height="180"><g transform="translate(0,10)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="40" x2="40" y1="0" y2="130" style="text:[object Object]"></line><g transform="translate(40, 0)"><g transform="translate(0, 130)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">0</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 110)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 90)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">4</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 70)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">6</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 49.99999999999999)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">8</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 29.999999999999993)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">10</text></g><g transform="translate(0, 9.999999999999993)" style="text:[object Object]"><line y1="0" y2="0" x1="6" x2="-6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="end" dy="0.32em" transform="translate(-14, 0)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">12</text></g></g></g><g transform="translate(40,140)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="130" y1="0" y2="0" style="text:[object Object]"></line><g transform="translate(0, 0)"><g transform="translate(0, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2.0</text></g><g transform="translate(26.00000000000002, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2.2</text></g><g transform="translate(51.999999999999986, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2.4</text></g><g transform="translate(78.00000000000001, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2.6</text></g><g transform="translate(103.99999999999997, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">2.8</text></g><g transform="translate(130, 0)" style="text:[object Object]"><line x1="0" x2="0" y1="-6" y2="6" style="text:[object Object]"></line><text text-anchor="middle" dy="0.72em" transform="translate(0, 14)" style="text:[object Object];font-size:11px;fill:#ee0000">3.0</text></g></g></g><path d="M0,130C-5.777777777777778,100.44444444444446,-11.555555555555555,70.88888888888889,0,49.99999999999999C11.555555555555555,29.111111111111093,40.44444444444444,16.88888888888888,65,9.999999999999993C89.55555555555556,3.1111111111111076,109.77777777777777,1.5555555555555538,130,0L130,130C109.77777777777777,130,89.55555555555556,130,65,130C40.44444444444444,130,11.555555555555554,130,0,130C-11.555555555555554,130,-5.777777777777777,130,0,130Z" transform="translate(40,10)" style="opacity:1;stroke:#ee0000;fill:#e27475;stroke-width:3"></path><g transform="translate(40,10)"><circle r="10" cx="51.999999999999986" cy="38.00000000000001" style="opacity:1.0;stroke:#0085ff;fill:#0085ff;stroke-width:2"></circle></g></svg></p><figcaption>Fig 3.

function to measure how far away we are from the example we are examining. We
could also choose different feature representations –&nbsp;e.g. pixels, or
superpixels. All these decisions introduce a large number of hyperparameters

<p>Letâ€™s start with a <code>masscan</code> probe to establish the open ports in the host.</p>

<p>Notice the use of Python format string operation instead of parameter substitution? According to Pythonâ€™s <code>sqlite3</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html">module</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shouldnâ€™t assemble your query using Pythonâ€™s string operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program vulnerable to an SQL injection attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only caveats are: 1) the SQL injection string must not be more than 140 characters long and 2) it must not contain these words.</p>

<h3 id="hash-length-extension-attack">Hash Length Extension Attack</h3>
<p>Too bad I could not crack the hash to recover the password. However, we can replay a session to gain access as <code>admin</code>. According to the source, the session is encoded as a cookie in this format.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>create_cookie</span><span>(</span><span>session</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The part before the dot is the session and the part after the dot is the signature. The session is no more than the the key-value pair of <code>user=admin;secret=f1fc12010c094016def791e1435ddfdcaeccf8250e36630c0bc93285c2971105;</code>. The signature is the SHA256 hash of a random secret between 8 and 15 characters, concatenated with the session.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack">Wikipedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In cryptography and computer security, a <strong>length extension attack</strong> is a type of attack where an attacker can use <strong>Hash</strong>(<em>message1</em>) and the length of <em>message1</em> to calculate <strong>Hash</strong>(<em>message1</em> â€– <em>message2</em>) for an attacker-controlled <em>message2</em>, without needing to know the content of <em>message1</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the <code>sign</code> function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Looks like we have all the known variables to launch this attack to get the signature. Armed with this insight, I wrote a simple script thatâ€™ll generate all valid cookies for the random secret between 8 and 15 characters. The main driver doing all the heavy lifting for this script is <a href="https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender"><code>hash_extender</code></a>.</p>

<p>Oftentimes when I am conversing about the design of Rust with other users - as
on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">RFCs</a> or the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/">internals forum</a> - I witness a peculiar
remark about “explicitness.” It usually goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not like <code>Feature Design X</code> because it is too implicit. Magic is okay in
<code>Other Language Y</code>, but Rust is supposed to be an explicit language, so we
should go with <code>Feature Design Z</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve come to strongly dislike these comments, because they contain very little
actionable feedback. They simply assert that “explicit is better than implicit”
(an assumption that we are all supposed to accept unquestioningly), and that a
particular design is less explicit than an alternative (often without even
explaining <em>how</em> they find it less explicit), and therefore the alternative is
clearly preferable.</p>

<p>In a blog post earlier this year, Aaron tried to dig into the question of
explicitness with a discussion of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html">reasoning
footprint</a>. He attempted to break down the components of
explicitness and implicitness so that we could perform a more nuanced
assessment of “how implicit” a language feature is. I want to do a sort of
orthogonal breakdown, and try to divide up the space of what we often mean when
we use the word “explicit.”</p>

<p>English is a very fuzzy language, so every adjective has a variety of
different, highly contextual definitions (for example: the way I just used
“fuzzy” in this sentence). Explicit is no different, so I cannot say that
anyone is using the word “explicit” <em>incorrectly</em>. But I can suggest that we
try to use more targeted language when we talk about explicitness, so that we
can have a more precise conversation about what our concerns are.</p>



<p>Sometimes in frustration at “explicit is better than implicit” I am tempted to
take the opposite position just to be contrarian - explicitness is bad,
implicitness is better. In reality I do think that Rust is an uncommonly
explicit language, but when I use the word explicit, I mean something more
specific than most users seem to mean. To me, <strong>Rust is explicit because you
can figure out a lot about your program from the source of it</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, here’s some Rust structs:</p>

<pre><code>struct Doggo {
    coat_color: Color,
    stamina: u32,
    love: u32,
    // NOTE: always set to true
    is_a_good_dog: bool,
}

struct Color(u8, u8, u8);

struct TennisBall;

struct Park {
   dogs: Vec&lt;Doggo&gt;,
}

struct Fetch&lt;'a&gt; {
    park: &amp;'a Park,
    doggo: &amp;'a Doggo,
    ball: TennisBall,
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can tell a lot of things about how these structs will be laid out in memory
by looking at them:</p>

<ul>
<li>I know what fields any of these structs could have (unlike some dynamic
languages).</li>
<li>I know what sets of values are valid for each field of each of these structs
(that is, I know what type they are).</li>
<li>Except for the vector of Doggos in Park, I know all of this data will be
allocated on the stack.</li>
<li>The TennisBall struct has no fields, so it will be completely compiled away.</li>
<li>I know that the references in <code>Fetch</code> will be pointers to a Park and a Doggo.</li>
<li>I can get a good guess as to the size of each struct, depending on how
alignment will turn out on my target platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that’s not explicit in this sense of the word is the exact ordering
of the fields in these structs. Rust has intentionally left field ordering
unspecified in order to optimize the layout of structs by reordering their
fields. Usually this doesn’t matter to you, but it does if you are writing
unsafe code.</p>

<p>I think it is often very good to be explicit in the sense about many things.
There’s always a trade off in choosing to ensure that something is explicit
like this (for example, the compiler can’t silently decide to allocate data in
the heap instead of the stack, or vice versa, as an optimization). I’d say that
in this sense, Rust is a explicit about more aspects of your program than most
languages, and this is a great strength.</p>

<p>But this is a very narrow definition of explicitness. All it means is that
given a source code, I can answer cewrtain questions about the program it is
associated with. I want to break up the idea of explicitness into some other,
narrower definitions, and examine how different features do or don’t exhibit
those notions of explicitness.</p>





<p>Sometimes, when syntax is suggested that is lighter weight, I see users suggest
that this is more implicit. But as long as the source code conveys the
information, it is still explicit in the narrow sense I defined above. I would
call this attribute <strong>noisiness</strong>.</p>

<p>An example of this was the introduction of the <code>?</code> operator. This operator was
fewer characters than the previous <code>try!</code> macro. Some users were concerned that
this would make it easy to miss early returns from <code>?</code> in their program. Here,
they were arguing in favor of noisiness: these users felt that it was important
that early return be noisy, not only that it be explicit.</p>

<p>I personally feel that all return points should be explicit, but not
necessarily noisy. That is, if I need to figure out how this function returns,
I should be able to, but its not so important that it be immediately put into
my mind when I glance at the code. Often - especially when forwarding errors,
as <code>?</code> does - the early return is the least important part of the source code
to me.</p>



<p>Sometimes, users argue that syntax should be heavy weight specifically to
discourage performing the operation it controls. Often, this has to do with
performance. For example, users may see it as an advantage that it is much less
pleasant to allocate something on the heap than on the stack.</p>

<p>Often, this argument will be couched in terms of explicitness, but “syntactic
salt” like this is quite orthogonal from explicitness or implicitness. Instead,
its about being <strong>burdensome</strong> for users, to discourage certain behavior. For
example, we could have an attribute like <code>#[repr(boxed)]</code>, which indicates that
this type is always allocated in the heap. This would be a more convenient of
this common pattern:</p>

<pre><code>struct Catters {
    inner: Box&lt;CattersInner&gt;,
}

struct CattersInner {
    color: Color,
    pounces: u32,
    naps: u32,
    meows: u32,
}


// With repr(boxed) this becomes one struct:
#[repr(boxed)]
struct Catters {
    color: Color,
    pounces: u32,
    naps: u32,
    meows: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would not be less explicit - you can look at the Catters struct and learn
all of the same information about how it is laid out in memory. But it does
make it much less annoying to allocate a type in the heap.</p>

<p>As before, I personally don’t find it helpful for heap allocations to be
burdensome. I struggle to think of a feature in which I want heap allocations to
happen by default, but there are many situations in which a heap allocation is
preferable to a stack allocation, and we shouldn’t make users feel frustrated
or like they’re doing it wrong when they make that choice.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-is-not-manual">Explicit is not Manual</h2>

<p>Sometimes, explicit is used to refer to requiring users to write code to make
something happen. But if the thing will happen deterministically in a manner
that can be derived from the source, it is still explicit in the narrow sense
that I laid out earlier. Instead, this is about saying that certain actions
should be <strong>manual</strong> - users have to opt in to making them happen.</p>

<p>For example, you could imagine a version of Rust that does not run destructors
unless users manually call the <code>drop</code> method. (Setting aside that you <strong>can’t</strong>
call the drop method today - let’s imagine that it takes self by value for this
example). This is actually safe, since Rust does not guarantee that destructors
will run.</p>

<pre><code>fn string_processing(string: String, numbers: &amp;mut Vec&lt;u32&gt;) {
    substrings = string.split_whitespace().filter(|s| s.starts_with('$'));
    for substring in substring {
        let n = substring.parse().unwrap();
        numbers.push(n);
    }
    // Must explicitly call this, or the string will be leaked:
    string.drop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to delete the call to drop, the memory associated with that string
would just leak. It seems uncontroversial to say that this would be worse. It’s
fine that destructors are called automatically, because users can always figure
out when they will be called by looking at when the value with a destructor
goes out of scope.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-is-not-local">Explicit is not Local</h2>

<p>Sometimes, when users say that something should be explicit, they mean explicit
within a particular section of code. That is, they mean that they should be
able to discern this fact about the code by looking at this particular snippet,
which could be of any size - this module, this function, this expression, etc.
Just because something is explicit in the source code doesn’t mean its explicit
in any given section of the source code - a better word for that is to say it
is <strong>local</strong> to that section of source code.</p>

<p>A feature of Rust that is not implicit, but also not local, is method
resolution. Look at this snippet of code:</p>

<pre><code>fn main() {
    let mut vec = vec![0, 1, 2];
    let x = vec.len();
    vec.extend([x, x + 1]);
    for elem in vec.into_iter() {
	println!("{}", elem)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this function, we call three different methods on vec - <code>len</code>, <code>extend</code>, and
<code>into_iter</code>. Each take <code>self</code> by in a different way (by reference, by mutable
reference and by value). Two are inherent methods, and one comes from the
<code>Extend</code> trait. None of this information is visible looking at this function
alone, but all of it is explicit if you look at the <code>impl</code> blocks for <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In contrast, the <code>?</code> operation does preserve this kind of locality. You could
imagine a world in which functions that return <code>Result</code> are automatically <code>?</code>d
inside other functions that return <code>Result</code> (this is how throwing exceptions
works in languages like Java). We’ve decided that you should not need to look
at the function signature to determine if a function can make its caller return
early. I think this is an example in which we’ve made the right choice to keep
something local.</p>



<p>So, if you ever find yourself reaching for the word “explicitness” as the crux
of your …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Exact reals are cool.</p>

<p>I’ve got piles of stuff to say, and there are tendrils that lead off in so many directions that I only cloudily understand, but it’s nice to rip off a manageable chunk here.</p>

<p>Any system that allows for arbitrarily accurate calculations of a number can be considered a system of exact reals.</p>

<p>That means the object that represents the “real number” must not be just a pile of dead data like a float. It has to somehow be able to receive instruction about the precision required and then output the desired answer. There are different representation choices for this that may be natural depending on the facilities of your language and tastes.</p>

<p>One that is very natural to me though is to represent such a thing as a function that takes in a precision request and outputs something like a number <code>Precision -&gt; Number</code>. This precision could be an integer specifying the number of digits of precision, and the Number could be a rational (a numerator and denominator) or some kind of arbitrary precision float data type from a library like MPFR, or perhaps an interval of these things.</p>

<p>How is an exact real different from an interval data type? This something I’ve wondered about. They do seem awfully similar. Well, I think I have a way to make an nonperformant exact real library from an interval library with a precision knob.</p>

<p>Here for example is an exact real in python that uses the <a href="https://mpmath.org/">mpmath</a> library for all the heavy lifting. <code>mpmath</code> has an interval type which is controlled by a global variable <code>dps</code> holding digits of precision. By placing the computation of the interval into a thunk, we can compute an answer over and over at increasing precision. Even though you don’t have to explicilty pass it, this global <code>dps</code> parameter can be thought of as a precision parameter to these thunked functions. The result of the thunk at each evaluation depends on it’s current value.</p>

<p>If you want nice python operator overloading, it wouldn’t be so difficult to wrap this thunk in a simple <code>Real</code> or <code>Refinable</code> wrapper class.</p>

<p>A different representation that might feel more natural is a stream of increasingly better answers. These two representations are basically equivalent. I can create a stream (a python generator in this case) from the function by applying it to a stream of precisions and a function from a stream by getting the nth element of the stream.</p>

<p>The only functions that play nice with a notion of arbitrarily refinable calculation are continuous functions. If you have a discontinuity, then an arbitrarily small width interval input can create a finite width interval in the output, which breaks the contract of what the real is supposed to do. It is no longer an arbitrarily refinable number and the shell game we’re playing where we pretend the intervals somehow are converging to a number go out the window.</p>

<h3 id="predicates-and-belnap-bools">Predicates and Belnap Bools</h3>

<p>So that’s all cool, but what really gets me going is to start considering predicates on the real numbers and boolean operations. One representation of a decidable predicate for a computer’s purposes is a function that takes in the object and gives you a boolean of the property holds on the object or not.</p>

<p>But here is an example that calls for a richer notion of truth than just booleans.</p>

<p>Extending what you accept as a notion of truth is very similar to extending what you consider a notion of number.
The only actual numbers are the counting numbers. I do kind of believe that notions of truth = {true, false} is a fairly natural notion, more natural in some sense than others.  And yet, one can develop intuition and comfort with the truly bizarre concept of a complex number $a + ib$ and treat it the same or analogous to counting numbers for a restricted set of algebraic manipulations.
And these other notions of truth obey similar algebraic manipulations or notions of proof, typically just more restricted in some way. Doing quantum mechanics with the naturals would suck (if possible).</p>

<p>The <code>mpmath</code> library when you ask questions about intervals like <code>i1 &lt; i2</code> operates under a three-valued logic. If the question is definitely true for every element in the intervals, it output <code>True</code>, definitely false it outputs <code>False</code>, but if there is overlap of the intervals it outputs <code>None</code> representing a “I’m not sure”.</p>

<p>So intervals behave under a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic">three-valued logic</a>. There actually is a default value <code>missing</code> in <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/missing/">Julia</a> that behaves in this way, and it is also not an unknown conept in the context of databases with missing entries. This three-valued logic I’m going to call the Belnap booleans (I think this may be slightly inaccurate. The Belnap booleans are a four valued logic. )</p>

<p>For our use case, the <code>None</code> means “you need to refine the precision more to find out”.</p>

<p>The refinables add an extra layer on this. The truth value used by predicates over exact reals is not a boolean, not is it even the three-valued logic of intervals. Instead it is a refinable three-valued logic.</p>

<p>The dependence of the interval on the precision is monotonic. If we increase the precision, the new interval must be a subset of the interval at less precision in order for everything to bve behaving consistently.  Similarly, these truth values can only increase in information. In some sense <code>None</code> represents a value of less information than the value <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. As the computation gets refined the information content should only go up.</p>

<p>Through an accident of the short circuiting mechanism and falsity of <code>None</code> in python, the standard operations <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are close to what we want for the Belnap booleans</p>

<p>The one case that doesn’t work is <code>(None,False)</code> in both cases. For <code>belor</code> we want <code>belor(None,False) = None</code> because it is not yet known what the truth value is. If the <code>None</code> refines to <code>True</code> it should be <code>True</code> but if <code>None</code> refines to <code>False</code> it should be <code>False</code>. Similarly we want <code>beland(None,False) = False</code> since we already know that regardless of the refinement value of <code>None</code>, the already known <code>False</code> kills it.
So we can just catch these two cases and fix them.</p>

<p>Here’s a question that all of us software developers face: <em>How can we best use our knowledge about the past behavior of our system to figure out where we should be investing our time?</em></p>



<p>One approach is to use a technique from the SRE world called <em>error budgets</em>. Here are a few quotes from the <em>How to Use Error Budgets</em> chapter of Alex Hidalgo’s book: <strong><em>Implementing Service Level Objectives</em></strong>:</p>



<p><em>Measuring error budgets over time can give you great insight into the <strong>risk factors</strong> that impact your service, both in terms of frequency and <strong>severity</strong>. By knowing what kinds of events and failures are bad enough to burn your error budget, even if just momentarily, you can better discover what factors cause you the most problems over time.</em> p71 [emphasis mine]</p>



<p><em>The basic idea is straightforward. If you have error budget remaining, ship new features and push to production as often as you’d like; once you run out of it, stop pushing feature changes and focus on relaiability instead. p87</em></p>



<p><em>Error budgets give you ways to make decisions about your service, be it a single microservice or your company’s entire customer-facing product. They also give you indicators that tell you when you can ship features, what your focus should be, when you can experiment, and what your biggest risk factors are.</em> p92</p>



<p><em>The goal is not to only react when your users are extremely unhappy with you—it’s to have better data to discuss where work regarding your service should be moving next. </em>p354</p>



<p>That sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? Look at what’s causing your system to break, and if it’s breaking too often, use that as a signal to address those issues that are breaking it. If you’ve been doing really well reliability-wise, an error budget gives you margin to do some riskier experimentation in production like chaos engineering or production load testing.</p>



<p>I have two issues with this approach, a smaller one and a larger one. I’ll start with the smaller one.</p>



<p>First, I think that if you work on a team where the developers operate their own code (you-build-it, you-run-it), and where the developers have enough autonomy to say, “We need to focus more development effort on increasing <em><a href="https://github.com/lorin/resilience-engineering/blob/master/intro.md#what-is-resilience">robustness</a>”, </em>then you don’t need the error budget approach to help you decide when and where to spend your engineering effort. The engineers will know where the recurring problems are because they feel the operational pain, and they will be able to advocate for addressing those pain points. This is the kind of environment that I am fortunate enough to work in.</p>



<p>I understand that there are environments where the developers and the operators are separate populations, or the developers aren’t granted enough autonomy to be able to influence where engineering time is spent, and that in those environments, an error budget approach would help. But I don’t swim in those waters, so I won’t say any more about those contexts.</p>



<p>To explain my second concern, I need to digress a little bit to talk about Herbert Heinrich.</p>



<hr>



<p>Herbert Heinrich worked for the Travelers Insurance Company in the first half of the twentieth century. In the 1920s, he did a study of workplace accidents, examining thousands of claims made by companies that held insurance policies with Travelers. In 1931, he published his findings in a book: <em><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/industrial-accident-prevention-a-scientific-approach/oclc/3493629">Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach</a></em>. </p>



<p>Heinrich’s work showed a relationship between the rates of near misses (no injury), minor injuries, and major injuries. Specifically: for every major injury, there are 29 minor injuries, and 300 no-injury accidents. This finding of 1:29:300 became known as the <em>accident triangle</em>.</p>

To see the original, check out <a href="https://risk-engineering.org/concept/Heinrich-Bird-accident-pyramid">The Heinrich/Bird safety pyramid: Pioneering research has become a safety myth</a> at <a href="https://risk-engineering.org/">risk-engineering.org</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>One implication of the accident triangle is that the rate of minor issues gives us insight into the rate of major issues. In particular, if we reduce the rate of minor issues, we reduce the risk of major ones. Or, as Heinrich put it: <em>Moral—prevent the accidents and the injuries will take care of themselves.</em></p>



<p>Heinrich’s work has since been criticized, and subsequent research has contradicted Heinrich’s findings. I won’t repeat the criticisms here (see <em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/foundations-safety-science-sidney-dekker/e/10.4324/9781351059794">Foundations of Safety Science</a></em> by Sidney Dekker for details), but I will cite counterexamples mentioned in Dekker’s book:</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon#Explosion_and_oil_spill">Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig</a> saw six years of injury-free and incident-free performance before the explosion in 2010. (It even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/louisiana-oil-spill-feds-gave-safety-prize-transoceans/story?id=10528236#:~:text=MMS%20issued%20its%20SAFE%20award,be%20taken%20as%20evidence%20of">won a SAFE award from the U.S. Minerals Management Service in 2008 for its perfect safety record!</a>)</p>



<p>Arnold Barnett and Alexander Wang found a negative correlation between nonfatal accident/incident rates and passenger-mortality risk among air carriers. That is, carriers that had more non-fatal incidents had a lower risk of fatalities. (<a href="https://flightsafety.org/fsd/fsd_apr00.pdf">Passenger-mortality Risk Estimates Provide Perspectives About Airline Safety, Flight Safety Digest, April 2000</a>).</p>



<p>Antti Saloniemi and Hanna Oksanen found a negative correlation between incident rate and fatalities in the construction industry in Finland (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-7535(98)00016-2">Accidents and fatal accidents—some paradoxes, Safety Science, Volume 29, Issue 1, June 1998</a>).</p>



<p>Fred Sherratt and Andrew Dainty found that construction companies in the UK that had an explicit policy of zero accidents saw more major injuries and fatal accidents than companies that did not have a zero accident policy  (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14773996.2017.1305040">UK construction safety: a zero paradox?, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety, Volume 15, Issue 2, 2017</a>).</p>



<hr>



<p>So, what does any of this have to do with error budgets? At a glance, error budgets don’t seem related to Heinrich’s work at all. Heinrich was focused on safety, where the goal is to reduce injuries as much as possible, in some cases explicitly having a <em>zero</em> goal. Error budgets are explicitly <em><strong>not</strong></em> about achieving zero downtime (100% reliability), they’re about achieving a target that’s below 100%.</p>



<p>Here are the claims I’m going to make:</p>



<ol><li>Large incidents are much more costly to organizations than small ones, so we should work to reduce the risk of large incidents.</li><li>Error budgets don’t help reduce risk of large incidents.</li></ol>



<p>Here’s Heinrich’s triangle redrawn:</p>

<p>An error-budget-based approach only provides information on the nature of minor incidents, because those are the ones that happen most often. Near misses don’t impact the reliability metrics, and major incidents blow them out of the water.</p>



<p>Heinrich’s work assumed a fixed ratio between minor accidents and major ones: reduce the rate of minor accidents and you’d reduce the rate of major ones. By focusing on reliability metrics as a primary signal for providing insight into system risk, you only get information about these minor incidents. But, if there’s no relationship between minor incidents and major ones, then maintaining a specific reliability level doesn’t address the issues around major incidents at all.</p>



<p>An error-budget-based approach to reliability <strong><em>implicitly assumes there is a connection between reliability metrics and the risk of a large incident</em></strong>. This is the thread that connects to Heinrich: the unstated idea that doing the robustness work to address the problems exposed by the smaller incidents will decrease the risk of the larger incidents.</p>



<p>In general, I’m skeptical about relying on predefined metrics, such as reliability, for getting insight into the risks of the system that could lead to big incidents. Instead, I prefer to focus on <em>signals</em>, which are not predefined metrics but rather some kind of information that has caught your attention that suggests that there’s some aspect of your system that you should dig into a little more. Maybe it’s a near-miss situation where there was no customer impact at all, or maybe it was an offhand remark made by someone in Slack. Signals by themselves don’t provide enough information to tell you where unseen risks are. Instead, they act as clues that can help you figure out where to dig to get more details. This is what the <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/">Learning from Incidents in Software</a> movement is about.</p>



<p>I’m  generally skeptical of metrics-based approaches, like error budgets, because they <em>reify</em>. The things that get measured are the things that get attention. I prefer to rely on qualitative approaches that leverage the experiment judgment of engineers. The challenge with qualitative approaches is that you need to expose the experts to the information they need (e.g., putting the software engineers on-call), and they need the space to dig into signals (e.g., allow time for incident analysis). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the exposed employee records that Sakura Samurai managed to access during our security research through their vulnerability disclosure program.</p><p>Reading time: 3 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>We noticed that The United Nations had a Vulnerability Disclosure Program and a Hall of Fame, therefore Sakura Samurai 桜の侍 our security research group, set out to look for vulnerabilities to report to the United Nations. During the research process Jackson Henry @JacksonHHax , Nick Sahler, John Jackson @johnjhacking and Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner identified an endpoint that exposed Git Credentials. The credentials gave us the ability to download the Git Repositories, identifying a ton of user credentials and PII. In total, we identified over 100K+ private employee records. We also discovered multiple exposed .git directories on UN owned web servers [ilo.org], the .git contents could then be exfiltrated with various tools such as “git-dumper”.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Records [Two Documents: 102,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/travel-records.png" alt=""><br>
Travel Records Included Employee ID Numbers, Names, Employee Groups, Travel Justification, Start and End Dates, Length of Stay, Approval Status, Destination and the Length of the stay.</p>
<p><strong>HR Nationality Demographics [Two Documents: 7,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/nationality-records.png" alt=""><br>
Included Employee Name, Employee Group, Employee ID Numbers, Person’s Nationality, Person’s Gender, Employee Pay Grade, Organization Work Unit Identification Number and Organization Unit Text Tags.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Employee Records [One document: 1,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/hr-records.png" alt=""><br>
Index Numbers, Employee Names, Employee Emails, Employee Work Subareas and Employee Org Units. Note: The column with the “Red number 1” represent the Employee’s specific work department and was blurred as some of the sub-units are smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Project and Funding Source Records [One Document: 4,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/project-funding.png" alt=""><br>
Included Project Identification Number, Affected Areas, Grant and Co-financing amounts, Implementing Agencies, Countries, Funding Sources, Period of the Project and if the Project/Concept was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Reports [One Document: 283 Projects]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/eval-reports.png" alt=""><br>
Overall descriptions of the Evaluations and Reports, Periods Conducted and a link to the report on the project.</p>

<p>In addition, on the lesser side of severity, we managed to takeover a SQL Database and a Survey Management Platform belonging to the International Labour Organization - also in the UN’s VDP program scope. However, it was of note that the ILO vulnerabilities were of little prominence as the Database and Survey Management platform were fairly abandoned in nature and contained hardly anything of use. Nonetheless, a Database takeover and admin account takeover on a platform are still Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We had performed subdomain enumeration of all of the domains in scope for the VDP offered by the UN. During our research, we began to fuzz multiple endpoints with tooling and initially discovered that an ilo.org subdomain had an exposed .git contents. Utilizing git-dumper [<a href="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper" title="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper"><strong>https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper</strong></a>] we were able to dump the project folders hosted on the web application, resulting in the takeover of a MySQL database and of  survey management platform due to exposed credentials within the code.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL Credentials</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sql.png" alt=""><br>
Note:</strong> <em>We will not provide a picture of the survey platform due to the specific nature of the application.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After we had taken over one of the International Labour Organization’s MySQL Databases and performed account takeover on the survey management platform, we began to enumerate other domains/subdomains.</p>
<p>Eventually, we found a subdomain on the United Nations Environment Programme that allowed us to discover github credentials after a bit of fuzzing.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/git.png" alt=""><br>
Ultimately, once we discovered the GitHub credentials, we were able to download a lot of private password-protected GitHub projects and within the projects we found multiple sets of database and application credentials for the UNEP production environment. In total, we found <strong>7 additional credential-pairs</strong> which could have resulted in unauthorized access of multiple databases. We decided to stop and report this vulnerability once we were able to access PII that was exposed via Database backups that were in the private projects.</p>

<![CDATA[Cheap FPGA Development Boards]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:
</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking5.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our traveling studio has operated off-the-grid since 2016.</p>

<p>For the first 3 years we tested the limits of our space, and at first, it was difficult to create new things, as we had to make time to learn how to solve the underlying problems. Our boat was not just an office, it was also our house and transport. As for us, we were artists, but also had to be plumbers, deckhands, electricians, captains, janitors and accountants.</p>

<p>Our main problems as a studio were <b>internet scarcity</b>, <b>power management</b>, <b>data storage</b> as well as <b>hardware</b> and <b>software failures</b>. Overtime we found ways to balance work, pleasure and maintenance. Here are some of the lessons we learnt.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power management</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking6.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our work schedule is tied to the weather, as we depend on solar energy to power our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough power for video-editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.</p>

<p>There are times when we must resort to secondary power sources, like our small generator or our engine's alternator, but we tend to prefer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ua_qxjbBTc">wait for the sun to return</a>. Waiting hasn’t affected our productivity, as we don't adhere to strict 8-hour workdays.</p>

<p>We tend to work only in the morning, leaving us time to pursue other interests in the afternoon. In our old life, we found that the 40-hour workweek ﻿<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/" target="_blank">kept free-time scarce</a>, resulting in us spending more for convenience, gratification and distraction.</p>

<p>Computers are generally power-sucking vampires. Choosing different softwares, operating systems, or working from machines with a lower draw (ARM) or even throttling the CPU, are some of the many things we do to lower our power requirements. The way that software is built has a substantial impact on the power consumption of a system, it is shocking how cpu-intensive modern programs can be.</p>

<p>Choosing software designed for low-end PCs is a good solution, it is also possible to throttle processes on your machine by using a ‘throttling controller’. The basic idea is like the throttle in a car, it allows to set the rate at which your system will operate and consume power. Another sure way to save battery is to limit multitasking. Disabling notifications, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/noscript/">scripts</a>, auto-playing videos or using internet browsers without opening multiple tabs at once are some of the many ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>Power consumption is also something to consider when choosing a computer. In evenings, if we need to work on light tasks, we switch to our low-power machines like the <a href="https://100r.co/site/raspberry_pi.html">Raspberry Pi</a>. To illustrate the difference in power draw, a Pi4 uses 2.85 W when idle, while a Macbook Pro uses 6-12 W. Raspberry Pis are backups to our main computers, as they are inexpensive and can run off small batteries.</p>

<h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking1.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Internet access is the woe of any working nomad. Internet is sometimes spotty, and data in some countries is slow, expensive, or limited to small blocks at a time. While circumnavigating the Pacific, we amassed sim cards, pocket WiFis, and have often used connections from businesses on land. Overtime, we found ways to lessen our dependence on internet, and to save on bandwidth.</p>

<p>With limited access, it is important to use online time wisely. Prior to connecting we make a list of tasks that we must do, such as pushing updates and making backups of our data online. It’s easy to get side-tracked on the internet, with websites designed to grab and keep our attention. When checking social media, we disable auto-playing videos and image previews to save bandwidth.</p>

<p>When we have a reliable internet connection, we gather copies of all the online material we will need. We keep offline versions of entire websites, writing guides, articles and even whole sections of Wikipedia. If we find ourselves without a connection, we can still solve our problems by using our offline mirrors. By the way, you can <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/master.zip">download our entire website</a>.</p>

<p>We research our destinations ahead of time to make sure we’ll have a reliable connection when we need it. This means we’ll be spending less time in secluded areas, and more time in city centers near a cell tower or WiFi signal. With some planning it is possible to have both paradise and connectivity, we found such a place in <a href="https://100r.co/site/internet_in_paradise.html#internet">Huahine</a> in French Polynesia, and again in Fiji. Internet access will only get better as far-flung island nations gain purchasing power.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data storage</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking2.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware failure is common on boats due to the hostile environment. Saltwater is the kryptonite of electronics. This is why it is important to backup data often to avoid losing work. There are advantages and disadvantages with all methods of data storage, but I’ll outline the most useful ones:</p>

<p><b>Cloud storage:</b> For a fee, you can back up your data online and sync files from your desktop. This method doesn’t eliminate physical storage as data can’t be synced to the cloud without a connection. Offloading data storage to a centralized service is problematic in other ways, because services have rules and owners and processes which can complicate things. For instance, country politics have made it that Google restricts access to some of its business services in certain countries or regions, such as China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Whatever data you have stored with Google Drive, if traveling to any of these countries will not be accessible. As conflicts arise, more countries can end up on that list. We keep documents we don’t need regular access to on the cloud, with copies on hard disks.</p>

<p><b>Hard copies:</b> Paper is a stable and widely accessible material, unlike digital devices which are subject to breakages and obsolescence. There’s a good reason books and other documents from centuries ago are still readable today. We like to keep printed copies of websites and other online reference materials, such as grammar guides for writing, or language manuals for coding. Keeping data like this means we always have access and aren’t limited to our computer’s battery.</p>

<p><b>External hard drives:</b> A hard drive is the best balance of practical and reliable for storage. However, hard drives are rated for a limited number of read/write cycles, and can be expected to fail eventually. To prevent data loss due to HD failure, it’s a good idea to store the same data across multiple hard drives.</p>

<p><b>Offline databases:</b> Keeping an offline collection of websites on computers or HD ensures constant access, and reduces the energy associated with re-loading them repeatedly. It’s possible to save web pages with most browser by selecting File &gt; Save Page As. To access the page offline, click on the HTML file. Another option is to mirror entire web sites using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">command-line tools</a>. We keep offline databases full of notes on a variety of subjects to refer to when there’s no internet.</p>
<p>For those who need a vast quantity of reference materials, it's possible to setup an <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_does_Internet-in-a-Box_.28IIAB.29_help.3F" target="_blank">internet in the box</a> on your boat. In short, it permits you to browse through the World’s Free Knowledge (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, OpenStreetMap, E-Books and many others) while offline. You can install an internet-in-a-box using very diverse hardware, like on a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/internet-in-a-box-raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Raspberri Pi</a> or on a terabyte HD with a built-in hotspot. This system was originally designed for students with restricted internet access and people in remote areas of the world not served by broadband. You can buy one, or better yet <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/" target="_blank">create a digital library</a> filled with content tailored to your needs. This might be especially useful for sailors who homeschool.</p>

<p>Keeping files on the cloud, on hard drives and hard copies gives our floating studio the redundancy required to ensure reliability.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Software has a big impact on productivity, they need to be reliable and fast. Those that require heavy updates, that have a high CPU usage and that need frequent connectivity to function are problematic for working sailors.</p>

<p>Much of the software on the market is designed by people living on the grid with unlimited access to internet. Tools locking up at sea, asking for a connection to continue working don’t float on a boat. Adobe products are a good example, as they require an internet connection periodically for subscription validation. If away from big cities, you may open your computer in an atoll to find that you no longer have access to the tool you need to get things done. Choosing a tool that doesn’t require a subscription is <b>essential</b> for working nomads that don’t have a reliable connection.</p>

<p>In our first year, we struggled to download the frequent and mandatory 10GB software updates from Apple to release our software on their platform, while on slow Polynesian internet. Processor-intensive software or apps is a strain on limited power and bandwidth, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The way developers write them can affect the power consumption of the resulting product. Chat rooms and bare bones text editors aren’t supposed to be process-heavy, and yet the popular communication platform Slack requires <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/" target="_blank">outrageous amounts of ram and CPU</a> to function. This is because Slack is embedding the entirety of Google Chrome in their app. Making software this way is costly to off-grid users, or those on slow connections, but luckily there are <a href="https://github.com/mayfrost/guides/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES.md" target="_blank">many alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>Our computer batteries should not need to grow ever larger only to support these bloatwares, nor should we need to add extra solar to power them. Just as you would look at the nutritional content of food products at the grocery store, find out how much energy your apps are consuming.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/working3.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Computers are subject to water intrusion and saltwater corrosion, but with some care they can survive in a normal marine environment. We solved most of the problems by cleaning external connections often, and by storing them in a sealed box with some desiccants after each use. The main issue with …</p></div></div>

<p>I strive to respect everybody’s personal preferences, so I usually steer clear
of debates about which is the best programming language, text editor or
operating system.</p>

<p>However, recently I was asked a couple of times why I like and use a lot of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, so here is a coherent article to fill in the
blanks of my ad-hoc in-person ramblings :-).</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>

<p>I have used C and Perl for a number of decently sized projects. I have written
programs in Python, Ruby, C++, CHICKEN Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Rust and Java (for
Android only). I understand a bit of Lua, PHP, Erlang and Haskell. In a previous
life, I developed a number of programs using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)">Delphi</a>.</p>

<p>I had a brief look at Go in 2009, when it was first released. I seriously
started using the language when Go 1.0 was released in 2012, featuring the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">Go 1
compatibility guarantee</a>. I still have
<a href="https://github.com/stapelberg/greetbot">code</a> running in production which I
authored in 2012, largely untouched.</p>

<h2 id="1-clarity">1. Clarity</h2>

<h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>

<p>Go code, by convention, is formatted using the
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/"><code>gofmt</code></a> tool. Programmatically formatting code
is not a new idea, but contrary to its predecessors, <code>gofmt</code> supports precisely
one canonical style.</p>

<p>Having all code formatted the same way makes reading code easier; the code feels
familiar. This helps not only when reading the standard library or Go compiler,
but also when working with many code bases — think Open Source, or big
companies.</p>

<p>Further, auto-formatting is a huge time-saver during code reviews, as it
eliminates an entire dimension in which code could be reviewed before: now, you
can just let your continuous integration system verify that <code>gofmt</code> produces no
diffs.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, having my editor apply <code>gofmt</code> when saving a file has
changed the way I write code. I used to attempt to match what the formatter
would enforce, then have it correct my mistakes. Nowadays, I express my thought
as quickly as possible and trust <code>gofmt</code> to make it pretty
(<a href="https://play.golang.org/p/I6GJwiT77v">example</a> of what I would type, click
Format).</p>

<h3 id="high-quality-code">High-quality code</h3>

<p>I use the standard library (<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/">docs</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src">source</a>) quite a bit, see below.</p>

<p>All standard library code which I have read so far was of extremely high quality.</p>

<p>One example is the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/image/jpeg/"><code>image/jpeg</code></a> package: I
didn’t know how JPEG worked at the time, but it was easy to pick up by switching
between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">Wikipedia JPEG article</a> and the
<code>image/jpeg</code> code. If the package had a few more comments, I would qualify it as
a teaching implementation.</p>

<h3 id="opinions">Opinions</h3>

<p>I have come to agree with many opinions the Go community holds, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#variable-names">Variable names</a> should be short by default, and become more descriptive the further from its declaration a name is used.</li>
<li>Keep the dependency tree small (to a reasonable degree): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=9m28s">a little copying is better than a little dependency</a></li>
<li>There is a cost to introducing an abstraction layer. Go code is usually rather clear, at the cost of being a bit repetitive at times.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments">CodeReviewComments</a> and <a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/">Go Proverbs</a> for more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="few-keywords-and-abstraction-layers">Few keywords and abstraction layers</h3>

<p>The Go specification lists only <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Keywords">25
keywords</a>, which I can easily keep in my
head.</p>

<p>The same is true for <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/">builtin functions</a> and
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types">types</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience, the small number of abstraction layers and concepts makes the
language easy to pick up and quickly feel comfortable in.</p>

<p>While we’re talking about it: I was surprised about how readable the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">Go
specification</a> is. It really seems to target
programmers (rather than standards committees?).</p>

<h2 id="2-speed">2. Speed</h2>

<h3 id="quick-feedback-low-latency">Quick feedback / low latency</h3>

<p>I love quick feedback: I appreciate websites which load quickly, I prefer fluent
User Interfaces which don’t lag, and I will choose a quick tool over a more
powerful tool any day. <a href="https://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/">The
findings</a>
of large web properties confirm that this behavior is shared by many.</p>

<p>The authors of the Go compiler respect my desire for low latency: compilation
speed matters to them, and new optimizations are carefully weighed against
whether they will slow down compilation.</p>

<p>A friend of mine had not used Go before. After installing the
<a href="https://robustirc.net/">RobustIRC</a> bridge using <code>go get</code>, they concluded that Go
must be an interpreted language and I had to correct them: no, the Go compiler
just is that fast.</p>

<p>Most Go tools are no exception, e.g. <code>gofmt</code> or <code>goimports</code> are blazingly fast.</p>

<h3 id="maximum-resource-usage">Maximum resource usage</h3>

<p>For batch applications (as opposed to interactive applications), utilizing the
available resources to their fullest is usually more important than low latency.</p>

<p>It is delightfully easy to profile and change a Go program to utilize all
available IOPS, network bandwidth or compute. As an example, I wrote about
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2014/01/17/debmirror-rackspace.html">filling a 1 Gbps
link</a>,
and optimized <a href="https://github.com/Debian/debiman/">debiman</a> to utilize all
available resources, reducing its runtime by hours.</p>

<h2 id="3-rich-standard-library">3. Rich standard library</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://golang.org/pkg">Go standard library</a> provides means to effectively
use common communications protocols and data storage formats/mechanisms, such as
TCP/IP, HTTP, JPEG, SQL, …</p>

<p>Go’s standard library is the best one I have ever seen. I perceive it as
well-organized, clean, small, yet comprehensive: I often find it possible to
write reasonably sized programs with just the standard library, plus one or two
external packages.</p>

<p>Domain-specific data types and algorithms are (in general) not included and live
outside the standard library,
e.g. <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html"><code>golang.org/x/net/html</code></a>. The
<code>golang.org/x</code> namespace also serves as a staging area for new code before it
enters the standard library: the Go 1 compatibility guarantee precludes any
breaking changes, even if they are clearly worthwhile. A prominent example is
<code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code>, which had to break existing code to <a href="https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/e4e2799dd7aab89f583e1d898300d96367750991">establish a more
secure
default</a>.</p>



<p>To download, compile, install and update Go packages, I use the <code>go get</code> tool.</p>

<p>All Go code bases I have worked with use the built-in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/"><code>testing</code></a> facilities. This results not only
in easy and fast testing, but also in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/cover">coverage
reports</a> being readily available.</p>

<p>Whenever a program uses more resources than expected, I fire up <code>pprof</code>. See
this <a href="https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs">golang.org blog post about
<code>pprof</code></a> for an introduction, or
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2014/12/23/code-search-taming-the-latency-tail.html">my blog post about optimizing Debian Code
Search</a>. After
importing the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/"><code>net/http/pprof</code>
package</a>, you can profile your server
while it’s running, without recompilation or restarting.</p>

<p>Cross-compilation is as easy as setting the <code>GOARCH</code> environment variable,
e.g. <code>GOARCH=arm64</code> for targeting the Raspberry Pi 3. Notably, tools just work
cross-platform, too! For example, I can profile <a href="https://gokrazy.org/">gokrazy</a>
from my amd64 computer: <code>go tool pprof ~/go/bin/linux_arm64/dhcp
http://gokrazy:3112/debug/pprof/heap</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc">godoc</a> displays documentation
as plain text or serves it via HTTP. <a href="https://godoc.org/">godoc.org</a> is a public
instance, but I run a local one to use while offline or for not yet published
packages.</p>

<p>Note that these are standard tools coming with the language. Coming from C, each
of the above would be a significant feat to accomplish. In Go, we take them for
granted.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Hopefully I was able to convey why I’m happy working with Go.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in getting started with Go, check out <a href="https://github.com/gopheracademy/gopher/blob/1cdbcd9fc3ba58efd628d4a6a552befc8e3912be/bot/bot.go#L516">the beginner’s
resources</a>
we point people to when they join the Gophers slack channel. See
<a href="https://golang.org/help/">https://golang.org/help/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>Of course, no programming tool is entirely free of problems. Given that this
article explains why Go is my favorite programming language, it focuses on the
positives. I will mention a few issues in passing, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use Go packages which don’t offer a stable API, you might want to use a specific, known-working version. Your best bet is the <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a> tool, which is not part of the language at the time of writing.</li>
<li>Idiomatic Go code does not necessarily translate to the highest performance machine code, and the runtime comes at a (small) cost. In the rare cases where I found performance lacking, I successfully resorted to <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a> or assembler. If your domain is hard-realtime applications or otherwise extremely performance-critical code, your mileage may vary, though.</li>
<li>I wrote that the Go standard library is the best I have ever seen, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have any problems. One example is <a href="https://golang.org/issues/20744">complicated handling of comments</a> when modifying Go code programmatically via one of the standard library’s oldest packages, <code>go/ast</code>.</li>
</ul>

I found writing my last post highly beneficial in gaining clarity around my own Mac use, so thought it would be beneficial to do the same exercise across iOS.</p><p>As the smart phone has become a constant companion for most of us, it is even more crucial to effectively manage its use. A smart phone is an amazing tool and can make life easier and more productive, but if its use is eight hours a day scrolling subreddits and social accounts, that is not a good thing.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve all been there, we’ve all spent too much time mindlessly scrolling content and websites knowing it does’t make use feel good, yet we still do it. We do it because it’s the path of least resistance to feeling like we are being ‘busy’. In actual fact, the activity just drains energy and more likely creates a chronic anxiety from putting off that thing that we should be doing. Once again, not a good thing.</p><p>Every-time we consume content, our lives and time are literally feeding the attention economy. We are trading our lives and lining the pockets of the rich, without even being aware of it. Unlike a job, we get nothing for our time traded.</p><p>Smart phones are useful, but we need to be the ones dictating its use, not the other why round.</p><p>Like my previous post for MacOS, this post will explain my current iOS setup from a perspective of digital minimalism that works for me but might be different for you.</p><p>If you find this useful, be kind and give it a like or share.</p><h2>Part One: Lock Screen</h2><div><a href="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1.png"><div><figure><img data-src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1.png" alt="Minimalist iOS Lock Screen" width="231" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1.png 462w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1-194x420.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1.png" srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1.png 462w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/File_000-1-194x420.png 194w"></figure></div></a></div><p>The lock screen is like the gateway drug to smartphone addiction. Unassuming on the surface, but can very easily lead to the substance abuse that is, content (over)consumption. From the lock screen, each hit comes in the form of Notifications, every ping releasing that dopamine we all can’t see to get enough of.</p><p>In and of itself the lock screen can’t be a distraction, but Notifications must be addressed in order to regain control of our digital lives. As you’ll see from the image above, my background image is one of the stock images provided by Apple. No time spent.</p><h2>Part Two: Home Screen</h2><div><a href="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen.png"><div><figure><img width="231" height="500" data-src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen.png" alt="Minimalist iOS Home Screen" data-srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen.png 231w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen-194x420.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen.png" srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen.png 231w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iOS-Home-Screen-194x420.png 194w"></figure></div></a></div><p>My home screen contains one app. The Drafts app. This is the only app I need to see and the only app I may need to access quickly from the home screen.</p><p>As the majority of any significant work is done on my Mac, outside of communication, I mainly use my iPhone for capturing tasks, ideas and thoughts that I can process at a later date, and the Drafts app is perfect for that. If I find myself needing to work on my phone, it just proves I haven’t planned my day properly and didn’t get done the things I should have in the time I allocated.</p><p>I find the issue with Home Screen setups that most have at the moment, is that they are in their very design made for distraction. It’s almost impossible to be intentional if as soon as you unlock your device, you have 100 notifications and various widgets vying for your attention. Next thing we realise 15 minutes have passed checking emails, the latest photo memories, social media and we’ve forgotten the reason why we even unlocked the phone in the first place.</p><p>Drafts allow me to capture ideas in the quickest way possible for later processing. When I do this, I can forget about the thing that I was thinking about, and carry on with my day.</p><h2>Part Three: App Library</h2><div><a href="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library.png"><div><figure><img width="231" height="500" data-src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library.png" alt="iOS 14 App Library" data-srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library.png 231w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library-194x420.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" src="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library.png" srcset="https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library.png 231w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library-139x300.png 139w, https://www.mattjennings.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/App-Library-194x420.png 194w"></figure></div></a></div><p>In the latest version of iOS, all apps are conveniently located a quick swipe to the left from the home screen, this means you no longer need pages and pages of apps taking up your home screen, not that we should have pages and pages of apps in the first place.</p><p>I will now explain every app I currently have on my device and its relevant use, excluding the default iOS apps that can’t be removed.</p><h3>Social Apps</h3><ul><li>WhatsApp</li><li>Facebook Messenger</li></ul><p>Not counting the two stock social apps included in iOS being phone and messages, I have two apps used for social purposes. The first one being WhatsApp to keep in touch with people overseas, the second being Facebook messenger. I would be inclined to delete Facebook, but if I were to, I would physically need to go on Facebook to check messages from those I still do communicate on this platform with, which I’d rather not do. So I settle for having the Facebook messenger app.</p><h3>Productivity &amp; Finance Apps</h3><ul><li>1Password</li><li>Drafts</li><li>Fantastical</li><li>Gmail</li><li>HSBC</li><li>Notion</li><li>Slack</li></ul><p>My Productivity &amp; Finance Apps consist of seven applications. I use 1Password to store all of my passwords so is useful when accessing passwords and other important information when out and about. I have Drafts to store any thoughts I have throughout the day for later processing as mentioned earlier. I use Fantastical on my phone to check my schedule and be notified of upcoming activities.</p><p>I know I probably shouldn’t but I have Gmail on my phone, I don’t get that many emails and have unsubscribed from all junk, so anything that does come through is usually important. The notifications and the app actually prevent from checking email multiple times a day. I might tweak my workflow to remove this app at some point.</p><p>HSBC is a UK banking app, I would delete it and only access on web but I need this for authentication purposes. Quite annoying. Even though I am not in the UK, I still have the Monzo app on my phone. It is a great service and would be useful for when I find myself back there. NAB is my bank of choice in AUS and have it on my phone as it enables Smart Receipts through a service called SLYP.</p><p>Notion is the only workspace tool I use, everything from task management, reminders, projects, professional development and notes can all be accessed from my Notion system, and is useful to have access to throughout the day for task management.</p><p>I use Slack for work communication, useful for when I’m out and about but still need to be on call. I keep in touch with a couple of people in the UAE and because WhatsApp calling is banned there, I communicate using Zoom.</p><h3>Utilities</h3><p>I only have two non stock apps in the utilities section of my App Library. I have Google Authenticator in order to manage two factor authentication on various websites I use. I don’t have a browser on my phone, if there’s anything I need to check or look up throughout the day I simply make a note of it in Drafts and come back to it later.</p><h3>Health &amp; Fitness</h3><ul><li>Wim Hof Method</li><li>GoWOD</li></ul><p>There are two apps I use as part of my morning routine in the Health &amp; Fitness section of the App Library and highly recommend.</p><p>The first is the Wim Hof Method app. I have been practicing Wim Hof Method for the last couple of years and I find the Wim Hof Method app a great supporting app. Using the bubble breathing timer in the app makes practicing the breathing exercises and tracking data much easier, and I enjoy the challenges that come up from time to time.</p><p>The second app I use is GoWOD. This is a mobility app that creates a personalised daily mobility routine based on your current deficiencies. After lifting weights for years, I have only just started prioritising mobility and wish I had done sooner.</p><h3>Entertainment</h3><ul><li>Spotify</li></ul><p>I only have one app for entertainment purposes and that is the Spotify app. It serves as my music player and podcast player; all the entertainment I need on a phone. Once I am in a more permanent location, I will be looking to replace Spotify with analogue records and their digital equivalent.</p><h3>Travel</h3><ul><li>Google Maps</li></ul><p>I only have one app for travel purposes and that is Google Maps. For privacy purposes, I should probably be using a different app, but haven’t considered any other suitable alternatives yet.</p><h2>Notifications</h2><p>Turning off most notifications can be one of the simplest things to do in terms of regaining control of your digital habits, and for that reason I have most Notifications turned off. I have had all notifications turned off in the past, but found it actually promotes worse habits having to physically keep checking apps when someone is trying to get in touch with you. The 9 notifications I have turned on are as follows:</p><ul><li>Facetime</li><li>Fantastical</li><li>Gmail</li><li>Messages</li><li>Messenger</li><li>Phone</li><li>Slack</li><li>Whatsapp</li><li>Zoom</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that most of these app notifications are for communication and scheduling apps only.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When looking to create a more minimal iPhone experience and its resulting more intentional use, there’re habits that need to change too. It’s all well and good removing all social apps from your phone, but if the strong desire is still there to check these types of services, you will find a way to do it. Hopefully, by taking some of the ideas I have presented in this post, it might assist in helping some of you get there.</p><p>Find this post useful? Give it a like or share.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p itemprop="description">Tehran, Jan 4, IRNA â€“ Efforts aimed at the revival of the container-carrying Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) train, which began during the recent decades by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey show the general outlook of Chinaâ€™s new Silk Road strategic ring-way.
            </p><div>
            <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The 10th meeting of high ranking Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul Railway Project workgroup, better known as the ECO Train was recently convened aimed at the urgent revival of this major regional economic plan.</p> 
<p>The spokesman of the Pakistan Foreign Ministry expressed certainty during his last week's press conference that the ECO Train project will be put to use during the new Christian year.</p> 
<p>Nikkei Asia economic news agency, too, wrote in a report that Iran, Turkey and Pakistan will put to use a railway that will link Istanbul, Tehran and Islamabad (ITI) in the year 2021. It is expected that the revival of the ITI ECO Train will through a rail-link join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), sometimes referred to as the New Silk Road, and is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived.</p> 
<p>The roots of this macro-scale project can be traced to ECOâ€™s 2009 container carrying train. The Economic Cooperation Organization or ECO is an Asian political and economic intergovernmental organization that was founded in 1985 in Tehran by the leaders of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. It provides a platform to discuss ways to improve development and promote trade and investment opportunities.</p> 
<p>Yet, the container carrying service launched by ECO merely proceeded up to the launching stage and was never fully used. Even the three countries will for opening the passenger trains along with cargo trains service among them has yet never been implemented yet.</p> 
<p>The 6,540km railwayâ€™s length is more than one-sixth of the earth belt. It includes 1,950 kilometers in Turkey, 26,600 kilometers in Iran, and another 1,900 kilometers in Pakistan. Traveling from Islamabad to Istanbul by the ECO Train takes 10 days and is a lot faster than the 21-day sea voyage between Turkey and Pakistan.</p> 
<p>A Pakistani state official who spoke to Nikkei Asia on condition of anonymity said that the ITI ECO Train will link through Pakistanâ€™s ML-1 railroad to Chinaâ€™s Uyghur-Xinjiang region, which is the major China-Pakistan economic zone and within Chinaâ€™s BRI mega-project. The completion of the project is scheduled for the year 2026.</p> 
<p>Economic observers believe the ITO ECO Train is the western side continuation of Chinaâ€™s BRI project. Lukasz Przybyszewski, a West Asia analyst in Asia Research Center of Warsaw War Studies Academy believes China considers the Iranian railways in particular, and the ECO railways in general as a major part of its BRI mega-project. During the war and crisis times, the land commercial routes are very precious and useful substitutes for the sea and airways.</p> 
<p>He added that China considers those three countries (Iran, Pakistan and Turkey) as active partners in its BRI project that need further investments with very precise planning in this project.</p> 
<p>The ITI will be the first regular China-Turkey rail service.</p> 
<p>Yet, there is also an indirect possibility. On Dec 19, 2020 a train traveled through Turkey, Azerbaijan Republic, and the Caspian Sea to Chinaâ€™s Xian city, in that countryâ€™s Shaanxi province, on the northeast side of Xinjiang province, which is at the farthest eastern end of the Silk Road, which once connected Ancient China to the Mediterranean region.</p> 
<p>This path, known as the East-West Trans-Caspian Corridor, travels through the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railways and the economic analyst believe China can develop its BRI project through both paths.</p> 
<p>James M. Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University says that Beijingâ€™s decisions on privileges and superiority of the ITI path towards Xian will eventually reflect Chinaâ€™s geopolitical economic ambitions.</p> 
<p>Dorsey said that in Beijingâ€™s stands and approach, Turkey is a significant economic market and in the long-run having numerous railways connecting China and Turkey will be very ideal for Beijing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>Table of Contents</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Machine learning and modeling interview questions cover some of the most basic fundamentals in data science. Given that it’s a rapidly evolving field, machine learning is almost always in need of updates. Therefore, as a data scientist, it’s important to keep up with the latest trends and technologies that are constantly being released.</p><p>Modeling interview questions and the machine learning interview are many times <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction for testing a candidate’s experience in the field</strong>, as well as determining to what degree a data scientist or machine learning engineer can critically <strong>apply theory towards a business goal</strong>.</p><p>As we go through each framework, interview question, and machine learning concept, it’s worth remembering that machine learning and modeling interview questions are ultimately indicative of two things:</p><ul><li>A candidate’s past experience working with machine learning.</li><li>The capacity to memorize concepts and apply them towards solutions the interviewer is looking for.</li></ul><h2 id="how-much-machine-learning-do-i-need-to-know">How much machine learning do I need to know?<br></h2><p>This is the most repetitive question that I have gotten ever since starting <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">Interview Query</a>. Why do you think that is? Because there is an infinite amount of knowledge you can consume in machine learning. </p><p><strong>Literally infinite.</strong> The very definition of machine learning and AI conceptualizes this fact.</p><p>Machine learning is a technology that is breaking ground every day. Technically, it should be improving faster and faster, given that machine learning and artificial intelligence is essentially supposed to be learning itself.</p><p>However, machine learning tested in an interview is completely different from how it is generally framed in real practice. It is also different depending on the type of role that you’re interviewing for. </p><p>A data scientist is not expected to know the same level of knowledge necessary for machine learning compared to a machine learning engineer or research scientist. This varying expectation, however, can be confounded by what the employer thinks a data scientist does versus a machine learning engineer, such as a case where the role is titled data scientist, but the position is instead designed for building machine learning infrastructure the whole time.</p><p>Let’s look at how much each role and position needs to know about machine learning interview questions.</p><h3 id="data-scientist">Data Scientist </h3><p>The data scientist role is primarily responsible for solving business problems using data to pull, munge, and generate insights from data. Data scientists will explore all aspects of the business and work cross-functionally with different teams to do everything from developing dashboards for reporting and exploring analytics for insights, to building models.</p><p>The last part of building models is tricky in determining how much machine learning a data scientist should know. Many data science roles that are focused on analytics don’t require any machine learning at all, while some roles are essentially machine learning engineers with a data scientist title. Generally, the main way to understand the difference is to ask everyone at the company about the day-to-day responsibilities of the role that you’re interviewing for.</p><p>For example, if we look at the Facebook Data Scientist role, we won't see much machine learning tested in their interview. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png 1150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/data-scientist">Interview Query</a></figcaption></figure><p>But if we compare it with the data science role for C3.ai and we see a huge emphasis on machine learning. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/12/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/12/image-14.png 1180w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/c3.ai/data-scientist">C3.AI Data Science Role from Interview Query</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-engineers-and-data-engineers">Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers</h3><p>Engineers build models and deploy them, develop infrastructure to scale, and work with data scientists to understand the best-use cases. They leverage data tools, programming frameworks, and data pipelines to ensure that models scale appropriately for any technical specifications.</p><p>Machine learning engineers should also have a strong knowledge of machine learning and theory, given their responsibility for building tooling and automation over the model creation, training, and evaluation life cycle.</p><p>Regular software engineers aren't expected to know too much about machine learning. But data engineers will likely need to know how to scale up data infrastructure alongside the machine learning engineers so that the models can retrieve and output the correct data points. </p><h3 id="research-scientists-and-ai-researchers">Research Scientists and AI Researchers</h3><p>Research scientists are typically roles meant for teams to break new ground with machine learning in the research domain. The level of machine learning and statistics knowledge needed is usually very high.</p><p>Given these three roles, the best way to estimate how much machine learning knowledge is needed for the interview would be to first understand how embedded in machine learning your job will be. This is done with individual research on the company, position, team, and background information of your interview panel.<br></p><h2 id="machine-learning-interview-questions-and-concepts">Machine Learning Interview Questions and Concepts</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-15.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-15.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-15.png 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Machine learning interview questions follow a couple of patterns. While they can seem abstract and overwhelming, we can break them down into six types of situational problems and case studies.</p><h3 id="modeling-and-machine-learning-case-study-interview">Modeling and Machine Learning Case Study Interview</h3><p>The modeling case study requires a candidate to evaluate and explain a particular part of the model building process. A common case study problem would be for a candidate to explain how they would build a model for a product that exists at the company.</p><p><strong>Example Question: </strong><em>Describe how you would build a model to predict Uber ETAs after a rider requests a ride.</em></p><p>Many times, this can be scoped down into a specific portion of the model building process. For instance, taking the example above, we could instead reword the problem to:</p><ul><li><em>How would you evaluate the predictions of an Uber ETA model?</em></li><li><em>What features would you use to predict the Uber ETA for ride requests?</em></li></ul><p>The main point of these case questions is to determine your knowledge of the full modeling lifecycle and how you would apply it to a business scenario.</p><p>We want to approach the case study with an understanding of what the machine learning &amp; modeling lifecycle should look like from beginning to end, as well as creating a structured format to make sure we’re delivering a solution that explains our thought process thoroughly.</p><p>For the machine learning lifecycle, we have around six different steps that we should touch on from beginning to end:</p><ul><li>Data Exploration &amp; Pre-Processing</li><li>Feature Selection &amp; Engineering</li><li>Model Selection</li><li>Cross Validation</li><li>Evaluation Metrics</li><li>Testing and Roll Out</li></ul><p>Try a machine learning case question on Interview Query<strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model"><strong>Bank Fraud Model</strong></a></p><blockquote><em>Let's say that you work at a bank that wants to build a model to detect fraud on the platform.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The bank wants to implement a text messaging service in addition that will text customers when the model detects a fraudulent transaction in order for the customer to approve or deny the transaction with a text response.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>How would we build this model?</em></blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model"><div><p>Bank Fraud Model — Interview Query machine learning problem</p><p>Let&amp;#39;s say that you work at a bank that wants to build a model to detect fraud on the platform.The bank wants to implement a text messaging service in addition that will text customers</p><p><img src="https://www.interviewquery.com/img/iq-logo.png"></p></div></a></figure><p><em>Read more about how to frame a <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/courses/data-science-course">machine learning case study in our interview course</a>. </em></p><p>Check out a mock machine learning case study interview asked by Uber.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ierVctGQ3EQ?start=200" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><span>Electrostatic lifters are fascinating devices that have become popular construction projects for experimenters all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA’s recent patent on a type of lifter design has&nbsp; spurred further&nbsp; interest in these devices.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_2" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_2.jpg" alt="lifter_2" width="371" height="268"></p>
<h3><span>What is a lifter?</span></h3>

<p><span> The basic device merely consists of a lightweight (typically balsa wood) frame, to which is attached a wire and a sort of aluminum foil skirt. The photos on this page&nbsp; illustrate this. The wire is charged to approximately 30,000 volts by means of a power supply and very thin wire attached to the corona wire. The aluminum foil skirt is coneccted to ground by a thin wire as well. When the device is powered it developes downward thrust and levitates.</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_1" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_1.jpg" alt="lifter_1" width="540" height="306"><figcaption>Lifter being powered by a 50kV DC supply operated at approximately 25kV. Not visible is the thin positively charged “corona wire” which is strung above, and parallel to, the flat negatively charged aluminum “skirt”.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span>How does it work?</span></h3>
<p><span>T</span><span>he device levitates by creating an electrostatic “wind”. This is caused as the thin positively charged corona wire ionizes the air surrounding it which is then repelled from the corona wire and pulled towards the negtively charged “skirt”. The force of this ion wind combined with the impact of the moving ions on the surrounding air creates an upward thrust. This is essentially how some of the “ionic breeze” air purifiers work that you may have seen in catalogs.</span></p>
<p><span>A well known effect called dielectrophoresis may also contribute to the device’s thrust. This is an effect whereby dielectric material in an asymmetrc electric field becomes polarized and moves towards the larger electrode. In a fluid dielectric medium such as air or liquid, dielectrophoresis can cause a continuous flow of dieletric material from one electrode to another. The more intense the electric field the greater the effect. Dieletrophoresis is consitent with experiemental results shown by encapsulating the electrodes.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>No TL;DR this time, sorry xxx</em></strong></p><p>At the end of <a href="https://importantinformation.substack.com/p/facebook-wont-win-the-ai-war">my last essay</a>, we gave up on hope. Hope isn’t good enough when the stakes are this high.</p><p>The only way to ensure that future AIs have incentives that are aligned with the individuals that interact with them, is by building an incentive structure. One powerful enough to force the organisations that build AI to have no other choice but to align with individuals.</p><p>How can you force Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Snap and TikTok to all swing their priorities away from serving advertisers to serving individuals?</p><p>You lower switching costs, making platform-exit a real option for individuals and therefore making anti-user behaviour extremely costly.</p><h4>Forcing AI organisations to align incentives with individuals</h4><p>We need to give individuals the power to enforce accountability on companies and AI systems that are not aligned with individuals.</p><p>Other than accountability through democracy, it seems like there aren’t many ways individuals can exercise power against the tech giants.</p><p>The way to give individuals that power is to build tools that help them to easily understand and control what data about them AIs/companies can access. Given that AIs need data to know us well &amp; perform successfully, if individuals only give data where they benefit and can revoke access en-masse when they don’t, then AIs have to be aligned with users or they won’t be able to compete.</p><p>The ability for individuals to withdraw their data en-masse would be a powerful accountability mechanism &amp; incentive to do what’s best for individuals. If we can build that future where individuals have fluid, granular control of the data companies collect about them &amp; that AIs use, we’re 90% of the way to achieving AI-individual alignment, because we have created <strong>the right incentive-system.</strong></p><h2>The path to fluid, granular data control</h2><p>But how could individuals control what AIs know about them? Most people don’t even know what companies like Facebook, and Google know about them. Just understanding what companies and their AI systems know about you is hard. Data isn’t easy to understand &amp; <strong>companies don’t *want* to tell you</strong>.</p><p>But before you truly control *anything* you need to understand it. You need to know:</p><ul role="list"><li>what data exists about you</li><li>who has it</li><li>what does it mean</li><li>what do they use it for</li></ul><p>Then, once you understand it, you can:</p><ul role="list"><li>reclaim data to keep for yourself</li><li>decide who gets to access it</li><li>decide what they can use it for</li><li>delete it from anywhere you want</li></ul><p>That’s a start, and would force these companies to perk up in their respect for individuals as humans, not just as “users”.</p><p>But even then you still don’t have true autonomy over your data. You’re fighting with companies over what *they* do with it. There’s a fundamental constraint on the possibilities of what your data could be used for, which is the incentives of the companies that hold it.</p><h2>When individuals have control</h2><p>If there was a company that didn’t have outside incentives for they use your data, that only served you, then your incentives would be aligned. Imagine if your data was no longer constrained by the imagination and incentives of ad platforms like Facebook and Google. What happens when the primary purpose of your data existing isn’t to make money selling you ads? What happens when data is broken out of corporate silos where it sits providing only a partial picture of who you are? to represent the full you? </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e2da1d25b8bed7662b12293/5ffba40b3c5ff12188d14361_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F7b3e7d48-c412-41ee-88df-65ab2e031032_1000x667.jpeg" alt="human hand holding plasma ball"></p><figcaption>Giving users control will unlock magic.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to grasp the magnitude of this shift except by analogy. When computing was only for businesses, the question was asked: but how would this be useful to consumers? <strong>A personal computer is pointless, nothing to use it for. The software hadn’t been built to make them useful, because there were no personal computers or users to build it for. 🐔 &amp; 🥚</strong></p><p>Right now businesses use personal data for their own ends. There are no consumer use-cases other than ad-driven feeds, beyond a hobbyist fringe tinkering with quantified self. For students of technology/Apple history: a hobbyist fringe tinkering with a tool that businesses find extremely valuable &amp; powerful. Sound familiar?</p><h2>New tools: from businesses to consumers</h2><p>With new and powerful tools, businesses come first. They have the willingness to pay &amp; the urgent need. But: consumer companies grow bigger.</p><p><strong>Computing:</strong> IBM (1911) &lt; Apple (1976)</p><p><strong>Social Networking:</strong> LinkedIn (2002) &lt; Facebook (2004)</p><p><strong>Data infrastructure:</strong> Segment (2011) &lt; ???</p><p>When personal data gets centred around the user, and users are empowered to choose what it gets used for, the use-cases will explode. Data will become a tool for thought, introspection, self-improvement, health, finding friends and partners, and for building personalised AI. Data will make us superhuman.</p><h2><strong>Who will win the AI war</strong></h2><p>There is a huge amount of responsibility placed on the company entrusted with the user’s data. Sufficiently good and complete data will give that company the power to manipulate users even more than Facebook and Google can do now. Do you really want that power to be held by companies selling ads?</p><p>Trust becomes the key differentiator in this world. Individuals need to trust that the company behind the AI puts their goals first. That the company wins when they win.</p><p>The real question here is: if you *can* control what AIs/companies know about you, will you let any AI access <strong>all your data</strong>? An AI system with all your data that’s aligned perfectly with you sounds incredibly useful. But who could you trust to make one? It’s difficult to pick a company - only Apple is making a case for themselves. Really you could only trust a company that has no external incentives. A company built entirely around you.</p><ul role="list"><li>If they are funded by advertisers targeting you with ads - NOPE!</li><li>If they haven’t been transparent with how they use your data - NOPE!</li></ul><p>i.e. ultimately this is no company we currently associate with AI today.</p><p>This company would need to be built from the ground up to be focused around serving the human user. Its revenue would need to come directly from users themselves - giving it no outside incentives. It would need to be the most transparent and trusted company in the world. It would give users true control. By being the most user-focused ethical, trusted company, it would have an unassailable comparative advantage over companies with baggage.</p><p>The company would need to stake its reputation on its pro-user behaviour.</p><p>No platitudes, instead: extreme commitment. Not “Don’t be evil”, but “Be Good”. Prioritising individuals’ autonomy, joy, and self-actualisation above profit. By being so pro-user, ironically it could become the most valuable company in the world.</p><h2>Time to shill what I’m building</h2><p>You might have guessed, but that’s the company we’re building at <a href="https://twitter.com/GetEthi">@GetEthi</a>. We're helping individuals to understand and control their data, and we'll shortly be releasing our first "use-case" for people's data.</p><p>It's definitely a bit ridiculous to claim we might one-day be the most trusted company in the world, and that we have a chance in hell of building the best AI, but <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice">Sam Altman always points out</a> that it is nearly always better to take the more ambitious path. So that’s the plan.</p><p>We’ve called it Ethi for a reason. Here are our extreme commitments:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ethi is short for ethical, and we want to be held to that standard.</li><li>We will make no revenue that isn’t from our users.</li><li>Your data will only be used in ways you <strong>clearly consent to</strong>, that benefit you.</li><li>Our motto is “Be Good”.</li></ul><p>We’ll be competing with the most valuable companies in the world. The most powerful companies in the world. Our existence is a direct critique of how Facebook, Google, etc. have done business. They can’t even copy us because they’re too locked into their ad-driven business model. This is what’s called “counter-positioning”.</p><p>Personally, I’m so excited to be building this company. Putting individuals in control of their data is my life’s mission. It’s the best work I could possible be doing. If Ethi succeeds in our grandest mission, it will ensure that individuals remain autonomous in a world where AIs grow more powerful and exponentially increasing amounts of data get collected about us. If individuals can understand, control and use their data how they see fit, the chance of AI-individual alignment will be hugely increased, &amp; individuals will have data-enhanced superpowers in understanding themselves, connecting with others, &amp; navigating the world’s complexity.</p><p>If I’ve done my job right in this essay and the last, you’re hyped and you want to join us on this journey. Sign up at https://ethi.me to get started controlling your data. This is just the beginning.</p><p>DMs, replies, thoughts, feedback, all appreciated, email is mike at ethi.me, follow me on Twitter @michaeljelly.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>At </em><a href="https://www.ethi.me/"><em>Ethi</em></a><em>, we help you to understand and control the data that companies collect about you. We’re making it easier for you to extract yourself from Facebook, Google and ore. We hope to build an accountability mechanism that makes sure the AIs that win will serve users.</em></p><p><em>You are not the product at Ethi, you are our customer - our only customer! This aligns our incentives with yours, and that we win when you win. We think if data collection and data-use remain as opaque as they currently are, users will never have the information or tools they need to leave platforms that exploit them. </em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>At Modfy, we are developing a desktop wrapper for <a href="http://modfy.video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">modfy.video</a> and I wanted to share how to package FFmpeg with Electron using Webpack. I think there is a lot of good work based around this, but it wasn’t very clearly documented, and I ran into a lot of issues, so I thought I’d document what I used here.</p><h2 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h2><h2 id="electron">Electron</h2><p>I really like typescript and react, so I’d recommend using this boilerplate, as it does a lot of the heavy lifting in that regard.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react</a></p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react.git project</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="ffmpeg">FFmpeg</h2><p>To ship a binary like FFmpeg with an application, we need to use the concept of static binaries. These are essentially binaries compiled with all their dependencies into one file that can be directly executed. Thankfully we don’t need to make these binaries ourselves, as other people have done the great work of compiling these binaries.</p><p>For example, the linux binaries are compiled here: <a href="https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/</a></p><p>These binaries can be used wherever you’d like inside any ffmpeg wrapper, such as <em>fluent-ffmpeg</em>, or calling them yourself inside a <em>child.spawn</em> . For the rest of the tutorial we are going to demo this using <em>fluent-ffmpeg</em>, but it shouldn’t really change anything.</p><p>We can find all these static binaries bundled together for us in this repo: <a href="https://github.com/pietrop/ffmpeg-static-electron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/pietrop/ffmpeg-static-electron</a></p><p>It does a great job setting things up, but can be improved for the final compile step to actually import the files into electron correctly.</p><h2 id="building">Building</h2><h2 id="electron-builder">Electron-builder</h2><p>The boilerplate uses <code>electron-builder</code> to build out electron, which simplifies quite a bit but can still be a lot to learn and figure out. The documentation on <a href="http://electron.build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">electron.build</a> is a good place to start.</p><p>The boilerplate will give you this within your build step in <code>package.json</code>, which is where all the electron build configs will go.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>"appId"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"your.id"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>"mac"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      </span><span>"category"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"public.app-category.video"</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>"directories"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>"output"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"packages"</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>"files"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      </span><span>"package.json"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      </span><span>"dist/**"</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div><p>While this is a very basic starting point, there is a lot more to add here to actually get the build working. There are tons of good tutorials on this, but I’ll still go over it here briefly for posterity.</p><p>For each operating system you want to build to, you must choose your targets. For example, for Linux we want a build target as <code>.deb</code>, for debain operation systems. (<a href="https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux</a>)</p><p>Within each target, we can add more changes and customization specific to that target.</p><p>For <code>.dmg</code> on MacOS, we need to make a few customizations to get the current dmg installer.</p><p>The contents determine how the <code>dmg</code> looks on MacOS when mounted.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>"dmg"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>      </span><span>"icon"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"build/icon.icns"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>      </span><span>"iconSize"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      </span><span>"contents"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>        </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>          </span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>380</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>          </span><span>"y"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>280</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>          </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"link"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>          </span><span>"path"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/Applications"</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>          </span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>110</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>          </span><span>"y"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>280</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>          </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"file"</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div><h3 id="build-resources">Build resources</h3><p>For extra resources related to the build itself, we need to make a folder called <code>build</code> at the root of our project, where we can store these files.</p><p>We can add this directory to the build like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>"directories"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>      </span><span>"output"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"packages"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>      </span><span>"buildResources"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"build"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div><p>This <code>build</code> folder will contain icons and other build assets.</p><h3 id="generating-icons">Generating icons</h3><p>For the <code>build</code> to work correctly we need two icon files; one <code>.icns</code>, and one <code>.ico</code>, for MacOS and Windows respectively.

Everything worked perfectly until i tried to query the networks available. I saw that the wireless connection was turned off. I went through the usual exercise of checking the drivers, then the antenna and checking if the card was seated right in the PCI-E slot. The card would never turn on. Since it was a re-branded Broadcom chipset i tried installing the Broadcom drivers as well as the dell drivers, no dice. Then i started reading up on the Mini PCI-E specifications for the WiFi card.</p><p>Older generation of WiFi mini PCI-E cards from a while ago usually have a hardware kill switch. This RF kill switch was usually connected to one of the pins on the Mini PCI-E header. Modern laptops are unable to turn on the WLAN card. Modern laptops can read and initialize the PCI-E card, but the radio part of the card is turned off.&nbsp;</p><p>From reading up on the spec sheet of several WLAN Mini-PCIE card from 7 years ago i found that that Mini-PCIE pin 20 which according to the specs was reserved for vendor specific purposes was being utilized as a RF kill switch.Similarly in cards with WiFi and Bluetooth, pin 51 is set for Bluetooth disable along with the pin 20 for WLAN disable.</p><figure><img width="658" height="273" src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=658%2C273&amp;ssl=1" alt="Mini PCI Express" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=658%2C273&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Mini PCI Express</figcaption></figure><p> Now i have to identify the pins in my Mini PCI-E card. Luckily the mini PCI-E pins 1,2,51,52 were marked in my card. Mini PCI-E cards have the first pin on the front side and the second pin on the reverse. They alternate with odd pins on the front side of the card and the even pins on the reverse side.</p><figure><img width="399" height="350" src="https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?resize=399%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501.jpg?resize=399%2C350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Dell 1501 Front</figcaption></figure><figure><img width="457" height="374" src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?resize=457%2C374&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?resize=300%2C246&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?w=457&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?resize=300%2C246&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DELL1501-rev.jpg?resize=457%2C374&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure><p> So to make the card work i masked pin 20 carefully with an electrical tape to isolate it. And PCI-E card started working normally. You can use any type of tape that is non conductive. PVC tapes work best. One has to be very careful while cutting and pasting the masking as it should not mask any other pin. &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=567%2C567&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="567" height="567" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pin20mask.jpg?resize=567%2C567&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Pin 20 masked with Electrical tape</figcaption></figure><p>When a PCI-E pin is not connected it may start bouncing.and hence in newer PCI-E card this pin is driven with a 1 or 0 to enable or disable the card. Older generation cards just kept the pin open and hence when connected to a modern laptop without the masking think that RF is always disabled.</p><p>This has worked for me.
