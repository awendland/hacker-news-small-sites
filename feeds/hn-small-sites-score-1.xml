<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>
<p>Some math in Julia:</p>

<div>
<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>; Function *
; Location: int.jl:54
define i64 @"julia_*_33751"(i64, i64) {
top:
  %2 = mul i64 %1, %0
  ret i64 %2
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This output is saying that a floating point multiplication operation is performed and the answer is returned. We can even look at the assembly</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>	.text
; Function * {
; Location: int.jl:54
	imulq	%rsi, %rdi
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	retq
	nopl	(%rax,%rax)
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens when we don't have type stability? Let's inspect this code:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>	.text
; Function ^ {

	movabsq	$power_by_squaring, %rax
	callq	*%rax
	popq	%rcx
	retq
	nop
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Now let's define our own exponentiation on integers. Let's make it "safe" like the form seen in other scripting languages:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[8]:</p>
<div>
    <div>

        <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>convert</span><span>(</span><span>Float64</span><span>,</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>y</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>


<div>

<div>
<pre>expo (generic function with 1 method)</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Let's make sure it works:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[9]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>expo</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens if we inspect this code?</p>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I started writing is to learn more. The Feynman technique was an inspiration for this.</p>



<h2><strong>The Feynman Technique</strong></h2>



<p>Richard Feynman was a theoretical Physicist. He won a Nobel prize for his contributions to quantum thermodynamics. In other words, he was a genius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a few minutes, listen to the genius here.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36GT2zI8lVA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Feynman always made sure he had a deeper understanding of concepts, before teaching it to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>There are four steps in the Feynman technique</strong></p>



<ol><li>Pick a topic</li><li>Understand the basics. Write what you understood as if you are teaching a 6th-grade student. Use simple language.</li><li>Look at your notes. Identify what you do not know yet. For example, if you are using jargon, you probably did not understand something. Go back to your source of learning and improve your understanding.</li><li>Review and repeat.</li></ol>



<p>We tend to hide complexities under jargon. In a business meeting or a job interview, a lot of jargon is often a red flag.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate test of your knowledge is when you can convey it to someone else.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Why write?</strong></h2>



<p>Writing is step two and three of the Feynman technique. This is where I try to convey what I understood to others. I make sure to write about the new topics I learn.</p>



<p>But there are more reasons for this.</p>



<ol><li>You share what you learn. It might help others. Even if it only helps one person, it is a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/positive-sum-game">positive-sum game</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>You will have a deeper understanding of what you learned.&nbsp;</li><li>It improves your language proficiency</li><li>It adds to your resume</li></ol>



<p>The last two reasons are a byproduct of continuous writing. It can be immensely helpful in building a great career. In a world that is more global than ever, communication skills and command over English can be the difference between the good and the great.</p>



<p>I have had people reach out to me after reading my blog post. Thanking, appreciating, and criticizing what I write. It makes my day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Learn slowly</strong></p>



<p>I’m a fan of slow learning. When I learn a concept, I try to understand it and apply it in my life the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently I read about second-order thinking and the inverse mental model. I spent a few days with it. I tried applying those in my daily life and work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More on that, in a different blog post.</p>



<p>The point is when you write, you learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>That’s it. There is nothing fancy here. It is a simple technique you can apply in your life to learn more things quicker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus, share what you learn. Be the light the world needs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante!

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses

34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

	<section>
		<p><em>(*) in software development</em><br><em>(**) during almost 20 years of professional journey</em></p><hr><p>Career development ain't easy. There's no single path - equally right for everyone. It's highly contextual, dependent on individual strengths, advantages ... and aspirations. And of course, there's the luck factor - you can amplify an opportunity once you face it but only if you face any ...</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe that some universal learnings could be applied by literally everyone. I've assembled my personal (highly subjective) list ... only to find out that it has quickly got out of control, growing to 10, 15, 20, and even more items. It was hard to question any of them, but I intend to keep a crispy, crystal-clear message - hence the decision to reduce the list to ONLY SIX most important advice.</p><p>First of all:</p><blockquote>1. No-one will manage your career for you; this responsibility is yours and yours only!</blockquote><p>That sounds more than obvious, yet 90% of people ignore that. For some reason, they naively hope their current employer will take care of their future - identify the most promising career direction, push them to develop necessary skills, make sure the work performed spurs the individual growth, etc. That MAY be the case if you're lucky enough to encounter a pristine leader who prioritizes people over KPIs, but ... it occurs very rarely.</p><blockquote>2. There's no (personal) development w/o challenges and goals - everyone needs some stretching and pressure.</blockquote><p>I agree that <strong>it's not the target but the journey</strong> that truly elevates us to the higher levels. But that journey has to have a meaning - we need a direction, an azimuth, and a goal within reach — a goal that is both worthwhile and achievable (according to our own judgment). Pushing tasks through (like a conveyor belt) w/o a broader context and fulfilling milestones quickly gets tedious, repetitive, and ... demotivating.</p><blockquote>3. Successful people "attract" the interesting work - the best way to boost your career is to prove to be effective &amp; reliable (adjust your level to current capabilities, it's OK to start small); stick to successful people first and become one (in time) as well.</blockquote><p>What matters, in the end, is not how well you know Azure or Node.js (sheer skills make you an efficient, expensive TOOL), but whether you're effective (<strong>you get the stuff done</strong>) or not. Engineers who focus on achieving "technical successes" (but rarely add any meaningful business value) tend to be very happy with themselves, though once they disappear from the team - its causative power (counterintuitively) increases. Once you get recognized as effective, you'll act like a magnet to the most attractive opportunities, the best people, and the most exciting technical challenges.</p><p>Get involved, take ownership, lead the way and don't be afraid to take (controlled) risks!</p><blockquote>4. We're all defined by the sum of our unique experiences. Nothing compares (in terms of learning speed &amp; intensity) to the actual battle scars we've acquired in the wild while learning craft the hard way.</blockquote><p>To get more experience (/skills /proficiencies), you need to face new experiences (/situations /challenges /endeavors) - if your work environment is static (conditions don't change) and you've stopped "learning by doing" - you're stuck and wasting time. Employers do realize that and try to "bribe" you with "horizontal promotions", privileges or extrinsic (material) motivators - such a <strong>"golden cage"</strong> is one of the most dangerous career traps. Do you know the difference between "10 years of XP" and "10 x 1 year of XP"? That's exactly the point.</p><blockquote>5. The proper career development model is 'E-shaped person': a versatile generalist with few, diversified areas of specialized expertise.</blockquote><p>Strong engineering foundations, based upon professional curiosity and traditional mental models (we all stand upon the shoulders of giants) are very important, but to make a difference, one should bring some unique flavor (attractive specialty) to the table. However, the tech develops so quickly and in such an unpredictable manner that betting on a single horse is simply too risky. That's why I suggest hedging your specialty: always have a plan B (pro-actively, not re-actively).</p><p>Treat it as the most important investment, <strong>the investment in yourself</strong>. If well made, it can upgrade your career from slow, linear growth to the accelerated, exponential one. </p><blockquote>6. Being a successful software engineer is far less about coding than it seems. Code is a fabric - an extremely malleable matter to craft the solutions with. But there's so much more needed for those solutions to make any sense.</blockquote><p>Abstract thinking, familiarity with the popular mental models (lingo, patterns, conventions), ability and willingness to communicate, open-mindedness and patience, eagerness to understand domain &amp; identify the business value, visual thinking and being capable of express and "sell" your solutions to other people (including non-technical ones) - all of those (and many more) are critical to BUILD good software products, yet how much do we do to actually develop those "soft skills"?</p><hr><p>Runners-up (pieces of advice that were close to the Top 6, but didn't make it in the end):</p><ul><li>don't avoid feedback, scream for feedback! (and provide some, just to set some good example)</li><li>especially in the initial period of your career, an experienced mentor makes a huge difference - try to avoid re-inventing the wheel by yourself</li><li>nothing hurts as much as a neglected opportunity - we reject some because we're afraid to leave our comfort zone, but how can you really win if you're always afraid to play?</li><li>networking is very important - be aware of what's going on in the community, what are companies (&amp; people) doing, who's on the raise and ... who's not</li><li>when considering next career move, the (organizational) culture should always be the most important factor to take under consideration (but unfortunately also one of the hardest to properly assess from the outside) </li><li>however crazy it sounds - especially in the initial period of intense growth - don't optimize for money (income): just assume the X% buffer below the top offer you receive and pick the best offer in that zone, having the money out of the equation</li><li>at last but not least - be honest with yourself regarding your life priorities &amp; aspirations: not everyone has a pure growth mindset, not everyone is primarily passionate about building software - it's OK, but in such case you should adjust your career decisions to make sure your other priorities are in the foreground; you cannot eat an apple and have an apple in the very same time</li></ul><hr><p>Feel free to provide your comments and opinions - do you agree with these points? Would you put any other above them? Is there anything in particular that has helped you in the most important periods (so far) of your professional career?</p>

<![CDATA[What ORMs Have Taught Me: Just Learn SQL (2014)]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 208 | Comments 187 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24845300">thread link</a>) | @IA21

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

            <!-- content --><p>Today marks the end of a chapter. With the TrueNAS 12.0 release, the FreeNAS brand is effectively done. We gave the entire backstory in our piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-is-dead-long-live-truenas-core/">FreeNAS is Dead Long Live TrueNAS CORE</a>. With the TrueNAS Core 12.0 release, that brand swap is now done and iXsystems now have a unified platform for both its “free” and enterprise offerings.<span id="more-47847"></span></p>
<h2>TrueNAS 12 Release Key Features</h2>
<p>Many of STH’s readers are going to wait a few weeks to upgrade given the company’s history with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-corral-canned-development-essentially-halted-now/">releases</a>. At the same time, the release is very easy to do for a current system. Under System -&gt; Update, you will see a Train dropdown. You want to select the TrueNAS-12.0-STABLE release train. Then Download Updates.</p>

<p>On our first test system we updated this took a few clicks and a few minutes until we were running TrueNAS core.</p>
<p>For the high-level updates on the new release, here are the key new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ZFS Native Crypto</b>&nbsp;– Per-dataset encryption and support for encrypted replication to untrusted targets.</li>
<li><b>2 Factor Authentication</b>&nbsp;– Allows using Applications such as “Google Authenticator” to provide an extra level of security before logging into the UI or SSH access.</li>
<li><b>KMIP Support</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS Enterprise now adds the ability to interface with KMIP servers for the storage and retrieval of passwords and encryption keys.</li>
<li><b>Performance Improvements</b>&nbsp;– Virtually every area of the platform has been updated and includes some major performance improvements, including SMB, iSCSI, ZFS and more.</li>
<li><b>API Keys</b>&nbsp;– All of TrueNAS can be configured with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/additional-topics/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrueNAS API v2.0</a>&nbsp;and now supports API keys for remote access. The v1.0 API is no longer supported.</li>
<li><b>Fusion Pools</b> – Allows creating pools with all-flash vdevs that store metadata and small-block IO. This provides flash-like performance on all metadata operations, but with the cost-effectiveness of spinning disk for storage blocks.</li>
<li><b>VPN Support</b>&nbsp;– Support for TrueNAS acting as both an OpenVPN Server and Client, depending on your VPN needs.</li>
<li><b>TrueCommand Cloud Integration</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS 12.0 systems can be connected directly to a TrueCommand Cloud account for scaled monitoring and management of your TrueNAS systems</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more on the official <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/intro/release-notes/tn-12_0-release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Now that our systems are moving to TrueNAS Core, FreeNAS is gone.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>You may not have seen this, but STH has actually had a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guides/top-hardware-components-for-truenas-core-servers/">Top Hardware Components for TrueNAS Core Servers</a> for some time. If you are thinking of building a TrueNAS Core server, check that out.</p>
<p>The bigger item looming is TrueNAS Scale. We covered how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ixsystems-starts-de-emphasizing-freebsd-for-truenas-scale-out-project/">iXsystems Starts De-emphasizing FreeBSD for TrueNAS Scale-Out Project</a>. While retiring the “FreeNAS” brand that aligned closely with “FreeBSD” the TrueNAS Scale platform we see as a clear future. With the ability to scale from a single node system like TrueNAS Core into a multi-node cluster, like Proxmox VE already can, the TrueNAS Scale Linux-based solution is where the company is headed longer term. Unifying FreeNAS and the TrueNAS Enterprise line helps the company move in this direction. For now, we do not recommend TrueNAS Scale because it is still an Alpha product, but it is certainly the one to watch.</p>
<p>At your readiness, it is time to do a few clicks, change the release train, and have a beer/ bourbon, or scotch to toast to FreeNAS retirement as the system reboots.</p>

                <h3>Test Automation</h3>
                <p>In today’s delivery methods like Agile and Continuous Delivery, every software dependent business is
                    focused to release quality software products often and faster than ever before.</p>
                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to
                    market the software.</p><br>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Aren’t manual tests really enough?</h3>
                <p>Not considering today’s software delivery needs.</p>
                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

                <h3>Getting started with Test Automation</h3>
                <p>Test Automation is not just about programming the test actions. It is an ecosystem of various
                    components and resources like the test automation team, test automation tools, test environments,
                    proper management of test data, integrations
                    that help deliver quality software faster.</p>
                <h4><strong> Test Automation demands </strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><i></i>

                        <p> Expertise in multiple tools and technologies for different application types</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Need for training on the tools being used </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Availability of realistic Test Environments to try and execute tests </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Integrations with multiple tools like Test Management tool, Test Data Management tool, CI/CD
                            tools, Defect tracking and reporting tools, Collaboration tools etc. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It takes significant time and effort to set the Test Automation ecosystem. Each application type
                    would require different sets of tools and one tool that suffices every application type hardly
                    exist. Though Test Automation is the right
                    choice in identifying and fixing bugs at an early stage, there are several tailbacks associated with
                    it.</p>
                <p>This initial demand of cost, resources, time and effort, makes it difficult for smaller teams to get
                    started with Test Automation.

        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

<p>In one particular context.</p>


<p>A while back, a colleague wanted to make a major change in the design of a system, the sort of change that was going to take a year or more, and many tens of person-years of effort. They asked me how to justify the project. This post is part of the email reply I sent. The advice is in context of technical leadership work at a big company, but perhaps it may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right solution?</strong></p>

<p>I like to pay attention to ways I can easily fool myself. One of those ways is an <em>availability heuristic</em> applied to big problems. I see a big problem that needs a big solution, and am strongly biased to believe that the first big solution that presents itself is the right one. It takes intentional effort to figure out whether the big solution is, indeed, a solution to the big problem. Bold action, after all, isn't a solution itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, in one of his more exuberant or desperate moods, Pa would go out in the veld and sprinkle brandy on the daisies to make them drunk so that they wouldn't feel the pain of shriveling up and dying. (André Brink)</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I am so easily fooled in this way, I like to write my reasoning down. Two pages of prose normally does it, building an argument as to why this is the right solution to the problem. Almost every time, this exposes flaws in my reasoning, opportunities to find more data, or other solutions to explore. Thinking in my head doesn't have this effect for me, but writing does. Or, rather, the exercise of writing and reading does.</p>

<p>The first step is to write a succinct description of the problem, and what it means for the problem to be solved. Sometimes those are quantitative goals. Speeds and feeds. Sometimes, they are concrete goals. A product launch, or a document. Sometimes, it's something more qualitative and harder to explain. Thinking about the problem bears a great deal of fruit.</p>

<p>Then, the solution. The usual questions apply here, including cost, viability, scope and complexity. Most important is engaging with the problem statement. It's easy to make the exercise useless if you disconnect the problem statement from the solution.</p>

<p>It is important you feel comfortable with the outcome of this exercise, because losing faith in your own work is a sure way to have it fail. Confidence is one valuable outcome. Another one is a simpler solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right problem?</strong></p>

<p>An elegant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all, at least in that it might fool people into thinking that the true problem has been solved, and to stop trying. You need to deeply understand the problem you are solving. Rarely, this will be an exercise only in technology or engineering. More commonly, large problems will span business, finance, engineering, management and more. You probably don't understand all of these things. Be sure to seek the help of people who do.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I think I understand multiple perspectives on a problem, I like to write them down and run them by the people who explained the problem to me. They'll be able to point out where you're still wrong. Perhaps you're confusing your net and operational margins, or your hiring targets make no sense, or your customers see a different problem from you. This requires that the people you consult trust you, and you trust them. Fortunately, non-engineers in engineering organizations are always looking out for allies and friends. Most are, like engineers, only too excited to explain their work.</p>

<p><strong>Engage with the doubters, but don't let them get you down</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you (Tom Lehrer)</p></blockquote>

<p>You will never convince everybody of your point of view. By now, you have two powerful tools to help convince people: A clear statement of the problem that considers multiple points-of-view, and a clear statement of the solution. Some people will read those and be convinced. Others would never be convinced, because their objections lie beyond the scope of your thinking. A third group will have real, honest, feedback about the problem and proposed solution. That feedback is gold that should be mined. Unfortunately, separating the golden nuggets of feedback from the pyrite nuggets of doubt isn't easy.</p>

<p>The doubters will get you down. Perhaps they think the problem doesn't exist, or that the solution is impractical. Perhaps they think you aren't the person to do it. Perhaps they think the same resources should be spent on a different problem, or a different solution. You'll repeat, repeat, and repeat. Get used to it. I'm still not used to it, but you should be.</p>

<p>Again, writing is a tool I reach for. "Today, I'm doubting my solution because..." Sometimes that doubt will be something more about you than the project. That's OK. Sometime it'll be about the project, and will identify a real problem. Often, it'll just point to one of those unknown unknowns that all projects have.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the stakeholders where they are</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, you're going to need to convince somebody to let you do the work. That's good, because doing big things requires time, people and money. You don't want to be working somewhere that's willing to waste time, people or money. If they're willing to waste time on your ill-conceived schemes, they'll be willing to waste your time on somebody else's ill-conceived schemes.</p>

<blockquote><p>May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. (C.S. Lewis)</p></blockquote>

<p>The best advice I've received about convincing stakeholders is to write for them, not you. Try to predict what questions they are going to ask, what concerns they will have, and what objections they will bring up and have answers for those in the text. That doesn't mean you should be defensive. Don't aim only to flatter. Instead, tailor your approach. It can help to have the advice of people who've been through this journey before.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph may seem to you like <em>politics</em>, you may have a distaste for politics, or believe you can escape it by moving to a different business. It is. You may. You can't.</p>

<p>Leadership willing to engage with your ideas and challenge you on them is a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Build a team</strong></p>

<p>You need to build two teams. Your local team is the team of engineers who are going to help you write, review, test, deploy, operate, and so on. These people are critical to your success, not because they are the fingers to your brain, but because the details are at least as important as the big picture. Get into some details yourself. Don't get into every detail. You can't.</p>

<p>Your extended team is a group of experts, managers, customer-facing folks, product managers, lawyers, designers and so on. Some of these people won't be engaged day-to-day. You need to find them, get them involved, and draw on them when you need help. You're not an expert in everything, but expertise in everything will be needed. Getting these people excited about your project, and bought into its success, is important.</p>

<p>Finally, find yourself a small group of people you trust, and ask them to keep you honest. Check in with them, to make sure your ideas still make sense. Share the documents you wrote with them.</p>

<p><strong>Be willing to adapt</strong></p>

<p>You will learn, at some point into doing your big project, that your solution is bullshit. You completely misunderstood the problem. You may feel like this leaves you back at the beginning, where you started. It doesn't. Instead, you've stepped up your level of expertise. Most likely, you can adapt that carefully-considered solution to the new problem, but you might need to throw it out entirely. Again, write it down. Be specific. What have you learned, and what did it teach you? Look for things you can recover, and don't throw things out prematurely.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2

          <p><span>Published on: <time datetime="2020-10-05">October 5, 2020</time></span></p><p>I recently completed a major overhaul of <a href="https://github.com/nickbabcock/jomini">a Javascript library of mine</a>. This overhaul replaced a pure JS parser (generated by <a href="https://github.com/zaach/jison">jison</a>) with one that delegated parsing to <a href="https://github.com/rakaly/jomini">an implementation written in Rust</a> compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly (Wasm)</a>. I want to share my journey, as overall it’s been positive and I expect that other JS libraries could benefit from this approach.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The parser in question turns a proprietary format that is akin to JSON and looks like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">tag=AAA
name="Jåhkåmåhkke"
core=BBB
buildings={ 1 2 }
core=CCC
</code></pre></div><p>and returns a plain javascript object</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">{
  tag: "AAA",
  name: "Jåhkåmåhkke",
  core: ["BBB", "CCC"],
  buildings: [1, 2]
}
</code></pre></div><p>So what were the pain points of the original JS implementation?</p>
<h2 id="original-motivation">Original Motivation</h2>
<p>Soon after releasing the JS library I stopped actively developing it. The files that I want to parse are millions of lines long which could result in tens of millions of JS values (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and dates). Parsing and allocating this many objects was taxing enough that back in 2015 I found no way to practically run it – the memory pressure caused nodejs to run out of heap space and when the code didn’t crash, the time required to parse said files would easily reach 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2020, I wrote this parser in Rust. The results have been fantastic: zero-copy parsing at 1 GB/s.</p>
<p>But speed wasn’t the only contributing factor. In fact, I firmly believe that someone could design a performant (but maybe not as performant) of an API around this format in pure JS. The other big motivating factor is accuracy and consistency. In no way do I own or control this proprietary format, so new syntax is stumbled upon all the time. Most recently data like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">levels = { 10 0=1 0=2 }
color = hex { eeeeee }
color = rgb { 0 100 150 }
</code></pre></div><p>So when I doubled down to cover all known syntax in Rust, I couldn’t imagine duplicating that effort for other languages and then keeping the parsing logic in sync. The Rust parser has been battle proven in multiple projects and I don’t want to start from scratch for a new language. To me, it seems preferable to have one implementation and bind others to it. Considering I’ve written this parser in C#, F#, JS, and most recently Rust – anything that cuts down on maintenance work is desirable.</p>
<p>My mind shifted to the JS implementation. Rust can compile to Wasm and both nodejs and browsers can execute Wasm, so rewriting the JS parser to delegate to Wasm seemed like the first step in determining how feasible it is to have all logic contained in Rust.</p>
<p>I should note that .NET languages can utilize Wasmtime to run Wasm, but this is not as mature. I wanted to start prototyping Wasm on the most mature platforms. Part of this process was to test if Wasm is too immature for a given ecosystem. In a fledgling Wasm ecosystem one could still be able to dip down to interoperating with native libraries (though native libraries have their own tradeoffs).</p>
<h2 id="rust-wasm-and-the-js-wrapper">Rust Wasm and the JS Wrapper</h2>
<p>This won’t be a tutorial on Rust and tools (<a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/">wasm-bindgen</a> and <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/">wasm-pack</a>). I suggest reading their respective books and tutorials.</p>
<p>My view is that one should always write a JS wrapper for the Wasm that exposes the Rust code as idiomatically as possible instead of making the Wasm a separate NPM package. To me, an idiomatic design means the loading and compiling of Wasm is entirely user driven. For instance, I have users create instances through a static <code>initialize</code> function that transparently handles the wasm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>import</span> <span>init</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>the_wasm</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js_bg.wasm"</span>;

<span>let</span> <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Jomini</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span>() {}

  <span>/* snip member functions that use wasm functions */</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>initialize</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> () <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span><span>initialized</span>) {
      <span>// @ts-ignore
</span><span></span>      <span>await</span> <span>init</span>(<span>the_wasm</span>());
      <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Jomini</span>();
  };
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that the wasm is cached on subsequent <code>initialize</code> invocations. Small Wasm bundles can still incur a non-negligible performance tax (50 kb compiles in 20ms), so cache them.</p>
<p>And in case you are curious about performance, it’s great! The Wasm implementation can parse a 1.3 million line file in 160ms. Considering parsing it in Rust takes 70ms, I think this is a great outcome. What might come as a bit of a performance shock is that deserializing the parsed data to a JS object takes over 6 seconds! I find this incredible – object creation can be more expensive than parsing. Expensive object creation isn’t restricted to JS either, <a href="https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson#-benchmarks">python is also afflicted</a>. We can fix this with a bit of ingenuity.</p>
<h2 id="wasm-lifetimes">Wasm Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The parser is zero-copy, but as shown it can be too expensive to serialize the parsed data to a JS object. The solution is to do less work: have the user specify the data they are interested in ahead of time using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON pointer</a> syntax. The below example extracts the player and then extracts the <code>prestige</code> field from the player’s country.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> } <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(
  <span>buffer</span>,
  { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> },
  (<span>query</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>"/player"</span>);
    <span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>`/countries/</span><span>${</span><span>player</span><span>}</span><span>/prestige`</span>);
    <span>return</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> };
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>The alternative would be doing the same operations but on the decoded object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>save</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(<span>buffer</span>, { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> });
<span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>player</span>;
<span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>countries</span>[<span>player</span>].<span>prestige</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Querying for just the interesting bits completes 40x faster (6.3s vs 0.16s) and uses about half the memory.</p>
<p>How this query API is accomplished with a zero-copy parser (a struct that has a lifetime to the underlying data) is a bit tricky, as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/423">wasm-bindgen doesn’t let one expose a struct with a lifetime</a>. The solution looks as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Query</span> {
    _backing_data: Vec<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    tape: <span>TextTape</span><span>&lt;</span>'static<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p>This struct works as desired through a two pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We transmute away the lifetime of <code>tape</code> to static so that we can store it in a wasm-bindgen compatible struct. This is the only <code>unsafe</code> operation – and it has to be unsafe as we’re exposing this to JS and Rust can’t borrow check JS usage.</li>
<li>It’s important to own the data that was parsed so that our referenced data isn’t reclaimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also why the API is exposed in a callback, so that the user extracts the data they are interested in and at the end of the callback, <code>Query</code> is freed (a method generated by wasm-bindgen on exposed structs) for the user so they don’t have to worry about manual memory management. This goes back to ensuring that users have an idiomatic API at their disposal.</p>
<h2 id="bundling">Bundling</h2>
<p>This will be the most opinionated section here. I prefer projects with a small number of dev dependencies and a minimal amount of configuration.</p>
<p>Here’s the build step from <code>package.json</code>: we manually call wasm-pack and remove any previous invocations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"wasm-pack build -t web --out-dir ../src/pkg crate &amp;&amp; rm -rf dist/ &amp;&amp; rollup -c"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And the rollup config is also simplistic</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>import</span> { <span>wasm</span> } <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-wasm"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-typescript"</span>;

<span>const</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>=</span> (<span>fmt</span>) =&gt; ({
  <span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/index.ts"</span>,
  <span>output</span><span>:</span> {
    <span>dir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>,
    <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>fmt</span>,
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"jomini"</span>,
  },
  <span>plugins</span><span>:</span> [
    <span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> }),
    <span>typescript</span>({ <span>outDir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> }),
  ],
});

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> [<span>rolls</span>(<span>"cjs"</span>), <span>rolls</span>(<span>"es"</span>)];
</code></pre></div><p>Rollup is used as it’s the best tool to generate both CommonJS and ES modules. CommonJS for the nodejs folks and ES modules for those using bundlers that can take advantage of tree shaking to remove unused code. The tree shaking is partially limited by the support code that the Wasm bundle executes on load (ie: setting up heap), but this shouldn’t be too restrictive especially if the main API of a library uses Wasm. Make sure that your <code>package.json</code> contains the appropriate references to the modules and types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"main"</span>: <span>"./dist/cjs/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"module"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"types"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/lib/index.d.ts"</span>,
  <span>"files"</span>: [<span>"dist"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>For those curious, I’ve eschewed the <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust"><code>@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust</code></a> package as sometimes introducing a middleman doesn’t significantly cut down on code and it introduces another layer to debug when things go wrong.</p>
<p>It’s easy to miss in the config snippet, but the below function inlines our Wasm as a base64 encoded string if our Wasm is less than 100kb (an arbitrarily chosen number that is larger than our bundle)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> })
</code></pre></div><p>The Wasm itself is still compiled asynchronously. If we omitted <code>maxFileSize</code>, then the Wasm file would be generated as a complementary file. An additional file that has to be fetched is not desirable, as it would be surprising behavior for clients who may not be aware of all the implications from direct or transitive dependencies (ie: they may need a build system that understands Wasm if they are deploying to the web). By inlining as base64 we make the Wasm an implementation detail (for node 12+ and the vast majority of browser users). Yes, base64 does cause the Wasm bundle to grow ~33% but this is offset by two factors: compression, so the cost of transferring across the network is less than 33%, and the Wasm bundles generated by Rust tend to be small. As long as one stays cognizant of file sizes this shouldn’t be an issue. For me, the generated Wasm bundle is 54 KB and <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=jomini@0.3.3">bundlephobia lists the total bundle size (JS + inlined base64 Wasm) as 33.4 KB after minification and compression</a>, which is smaller than <code>react-dom</code> (35.6 KB). In my opinion this price is easily justified. If the Wasm bundle is significantly larger, I suspect the likelihood of clients being aware of their dependency implications increases, so one can opt to supply the Wasm bundle as a separate file.</p>

<p>In March, as Covid-19 began sending office workers home across the globe, Facebook realized it had a serious problem. The company relies on a vast army of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">content moderators</a><strong> </strong>— often low-paid contractors — who are responsible for removing everything from nudity to hate speech and terrorism content. Their work is often sensitive and, therefore, can’t be done outside a formal office. As the world went into lockdown, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf">said</a> during a press call that the social network would lean more on full-time staffers and artificial intelligence to police its platforms.</p>



<p>But, he noted, some of this work would “still be done by teams in person.” One of those teams is located thousands of miles away from the company’s California headquarters in Hyderabad, India, where, as of last year, <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-facebook-contractor-genpact-doubles-minimum-salaries-for-content-moderators-in-india-report/">1,600 Facebook moderators</a> were employed by a third-party contractor called Genpact. This summer, even as Covid-19 cases were surging in India, Genpact moderators said they felt pressured by their employer to come back to the office. While most of Facebook’s full-time employees remain safe at home, these workers have been forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods: stemming the tide of the most unsavory and disturbing posts on the internet.</p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>spoke with four current and former Genpact employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the company. They said moderators were asked — in some cases as early as July — to return to the office to tackle sensitive content, including posts involving child exploitation, suicide, and other matter that could lead to real-world harm. Two moderators said that Genpact pressured workers to show up at Facebook’s office in HITEC City, a corporate district home to some of India’s biggest tech companies. Two moderators also reported that Genpact is continuing to shift more employees to work on Facebook content.</p>



<p>In a statement, Genpact said it couldn’t comment on specific relationships with clients, but it asserted that moderators are being asked to come into the office on only a volunteer basis. “To make this manageable, safe, and clear, employees need to sign a weekly form that asks them to voluntarily agree to this,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook also asserted that moderators are working in person only if they choose the option and that most are still doing their jobs from home. “Our focus for reopening any office is on how it can be done in a way that keeps our reviewers safe,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in a statement. “To do this we are putting strict health and safety measures in place, making sure they’re followed, and addressing and disclosing any confirmed cases of illness.”</p>



<p>With few opportunities for other work, the moderators who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> said they still felt like they had no choice but to show up in person. A senior moderator said that Genpact employees were also informed they could lose their jobs if they didn’t come to the office. “The operations team told them these are important orders,” said the moderator. “There’s a threatening factor behind [it].”</p>



<p>“People are forced to go to work, even if they are not happy to,” they added. Genpact denied that it incentivizes anyone to work in person. The company emphasized that coming into the office “is voluntary, and we remind each employee that their decision has no impact on benefits, pay, or status.” </p>



<p>In the middle of a pandemic and subsequent recession, it’s not clear where the Genpact moderators would go if they lost their jobs. “During Covid times, many companies are holding off on new recruitments,” said R. Chandra Sekharam, a commissioner with the Labour Department of Telangana, the Indian state where Hyderabad is located.</p>



<p>In March, an IT company that shares an office building with Facebook made a grim announcement: one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Fears of contracting Covid-19 soon swept the city. Hostel owners and other landlords in Hyderabad, afraid that tenants working in large offices would bring the virus home with them, began evicting people who work in business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to two Genpact moderators, that included some of their colleagues working for Facebook. When they reached out to Genpact asking for help finding a new place to live, one employee said the plea fell on deaf ears. “There’s no help being given by the company,” they told <em>Rest of World</em>. Genpact denied the claim and said it worked with authorities to stop evictions and offered some people alternative housing.</p>





<p>Just two days after that first case of Covid-19 was announced, Genpact employees were asked to return to work in Facebook’s office, according to one moderator who was called back. In May, the<em> </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/18/facebook-google-work-from-home/"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em> </em>reported that Facebook had offered extra pay to moderators in the U.S. who voluntarily agreed to return to work. The Genpact workers told <em>Rest of World</em> that no such bonus was extended to them in India.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the moderators said that their salaries, which amount to less than $2 an hour, were supplemented by food benefits, received either in the form of in-office meals or through a prepaid meal card. One moderator described the perk as coming directly from Facebook. But when Genpact employees were sent home during India’s Covid-19 lockdown, the benefit disappeared. During an internal Facebook meeting leaked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"><em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>in September, Zuckerberg fielded a question from a staffer at the company’s California headquarters, who complained about the lack of free snacks available while they worked from home. But for reviewers in India, meal benefits were more than just a cushy perk: They were a crucial supplement to their low incomes. (Genpact says that it is continuing to provide packed meals and snacks for on-site workers.)</p>

<p>Moderators who have returned to Facebook’s office in Hyderabad say they are unhappy but also afraid of losing their jobs. “Calling people in [to work] in such situations is completely unprofessional,” one former moderator told <em>Rest of World</em>. That person left Genpact after being sent home in March but remains in contact with former coworkers. “Genpact is doing it because there aren’t any jobs, and people are getting laid off. So people are too scared to actually say anything. And I think that’s what Genpact is taking advantage of.”</p>



<p>Contractors, unlike Facebook’s full-time employees, have almost no leverage to demand changes to their working conditions, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Despite accounting for a core part of Facebook’s business, contract moderators “are viewed as replaceable cogs in a machine,” he says.</p>



<p>Facebook has also been criticized for its treatment of domestic content moderators. In May, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/854998616/in-settlement-facebook-to-pay-52-million-to-content-moderators-with-ptsd">$52 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit filed by reviewers in the U.S., who alleged the traumatic nature of their work led to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Facebook admitted no wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the company vowed to improve labor conditions. Yet contractors have continued to report problems, particularly during the pandemic. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported that Facebook moderators at the third-party firm Accenture said they were ordered to report to their offices in Austin, Texas, without any explanation or extra pay. (Facebook said the work done by the Austin team can’t be done from home.)</p>



<p>Mithun Roy, a managing consultant at the outsourcing firm Avaya, says that companies like Genpact can charge more for employees who work directly from a client’s office than from an outsourcing site. When clients like Facebook request a firm’s services, Roy says they have to be as detailed as possible, including disclosing where the work will be performed. According to Roy, a yearlong contract from a client like Facebook can be worth millions of dollars.</p>



<p>“Management doesn’t want to miss this opportunity,” the senior Genpact moderator told<em> Rest of World</em>. That person said the company has been pushing moderators to work on-site at Facebook’s Hyderabad office even as Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed in the city, in order to gain an advantage over competitors less comfortable sending workers in person. “Even after the pandemic ends, this could [mean] new workstreams for us,” the senior moderator said.</p>



<p>Genpact and Facebook aren’t the only entities pushing contractors in Hyderabad to return to normal. The city’s economy is increasingly reliant on business from multinational tech companies. It’s been home to Microsoft’s regional headquarters since 1998, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/amazon-hyderabad-india.html">the largest Amazon office</a> in the world opened there last year. As the pandemic progressed, and many workers left the city for their hometowns, officials began fearing that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/lay-offs-loom-over-it-sector-in-hyderabad-telangana-govt-urges-centre-to-act-11588317514170.html">Hyderabad’s tech industry would soon experience massive layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Hyderabad went into lockdown on March 22. Officials began allowing <a href="https://qz.com/india/1834746/some-tcs-infosys-wipro-staff-go-to-work-amid-coronavirus/">IT workers to return to the office less than two months later on May 1</a>, and some even sooner. During India’s lockdown and subsequent reopening, IT companies were considered “essential” by the government, allowing them to skirt certain coronavirus regulations placed on other businesses. According to a state minister in Hyderabad, this designation predates the pandemic: It’s meant as a guarantee to multinational companies that their outsourced workforces won’t be disrupted.</p>



<p>Activists and health care workers <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/COVID-19-Telangana-Govt-Grossly-Under-Reporting-Cases-Activists">have warned</a> that the state of Telangana “vastly” underreported cases of Covid-19 and deaths related to the virus. In July, when the senior moderator said their colleagues began returning to the office, case counts were …</p></div></div>

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

For the first time now, researchers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (also known as “KIT”) in Germany have succeeded in developing a computer system that outperforms humans in recognizing spontaneously spoken language with minimum latency.&nbsp;</p><p>This is reported on the Internet platform <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=ZGE0MDU4Mzc1NmY2MWU2NmYzOTllNWE2NGUwYjNlYjhhMDY1N2I1MixmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603415768">ArXiv.org</a>.</p><p>“When people talk to each other, there are stops, stutterings, hesitations, such as “er” or “hmmm”, laughs and coughs,” says Alex Waibel, Professor for Informatics at KIT. “Often, words are pronounced unclearly.” This makes it difficult even for people to make accurate notes of a conversation. “And so far, this has been even more difficult for AI,” adds the speech recognition expert. KIT scientists and staff of KITES, a start-up company from KIT, have now programmed a computer system that executes this task better than humans and quicker than other systems.</p><p>Waibel already developed an automatic live translator that directly translates university lectures from German or English into the languages spoken by foreign students. This “Lecture Translator” has been used in the lecture halls of KIT since 2012. “Recognition of spontaneous speech is the most important component of this system,” Waibel explains, “as errors and delays in recognition make the translation incomprehensible. On conversational speech, the human error rate amounts to about 5.5%. Our system now reaches 5.0%.” Apart from precision, however, the speed of the system to produce output is just as important so students can follow the lecture live. The researchers have now succeeded in reducing this latency to one second. This is the smallest reported latency reached by a speech recognition system of this quality to date, says Waibel.</p><p>Error rate and latency are measured using the standardized and internationally recognized, scientific “switchboard-benchmark” test. This benchmark (defined by US NIST) is widely used by international AI researchers in their competition to build a machine that comes close to humans in recognizing spontaneous speech under comparable conditions, or even outperforming them.</p><p>According to Waibel, fast, high accuracy speech recognition is an essential step for further downstream processing. It enables dialog, translation, and other AI modules to provide better voice based interaction with machines.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kit.edu%2Fkit%2Fenglish%2Fpi_2020_095_ai-outperforms-humans-in-speech-recognition.php&amp;t=MDIzNzNkYjE5MjAzMWE0NWRlNzdmYjE5MTZmZDM2NDQ3Yzk1ZDEwZixmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603415768">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b> “Super-Human Performance in Online Low-latency Recognition of Conversational Speech”,&nbsp;ArXiv.org.<br></p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=ZGE0MDU4Mzc1NmY2MWU2NmYzOTllNWE2NGUwYjNlYjhhMDY1N2I1MixmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603415768">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03449</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632109737244311552/nuance-va-speech-recognition">VA expands telehealth services with speech recognition cloud platform</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago I added <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-clarifies-jamstack-remarks#comment-344626">this comment in WPTavern</a>, on an article where WordPress founder's Matt Mullenweg clarifies his earlier remarks that the Jamstack is "a regression for the vast majority of the people adopting it".</p><p>Since I like owing my own content, I reproduce it here in my own blog.</p><hr><p>I think Matt’s brutal honesty is welcome, because most information out there about the Jamstack praises it. However, it also comes from developers using these modern new tools, evaluating their own convenience and satisfaction. As Matt points out, that doesn’t mean it makes it easier for the end user to use the software, which is what WordPress is good at.</p><p>I actually like the Jamstack, but because of how complex it is, it’s rather limiting, even to support some otherwise basic functionality.</p><p>The definitive example is comments, which should be at the core websites building communities. WordPress is extremely good at supporting comments in the site. The Jamstack is sooooo bad at it. In all these many years, nobody has been able to solve comments for the Jamstack, which for me evidences that it is inherently unsuitable to support this feature.</p><p>All attempts so far have been workarounds, not solutions. Eg:</p><ul><li>Netlify forms: no hierarchy, so can post a comment but not a response (unless adding some meta to the comment body? how ugly is that?)</li><li>Storing comments in a GitHub repo: it takes a long time to merge the PR with the comment</li></ul><p>Also, all these solutions are overtly complicated. Do I need to set-up a webhook to trigger a new build just to add a comment? And then, maybe cache the new comment in the client’s LocalStorage for if the user refreshes the page immediately, before the new build is finished? Seriously?</p><p>And then, they don’t provide the killer feature: to send notifications of the new comment to all parties involved in the discussion. That’s how communities get built, and websites become successful. Speed is a factor. But more important than speed, it is dynamic functionality to support communities. The website may look fancy, but it may well become a ghost town.</p><p>(Btw, as an exercise, you can research which websites started as WordPress and then migrated to the Jamstack, and check how many comments they had then vs now… the numbers will, most likely, be waaaaaaay down)</p><p>Another way is to not pre-render the comments, but render them dynamically after fetching it with an API. Yes, this solution works, but then you still have WordPress (or some other CMS) in the back-end to store the comments :P</p><p>The final option is to use 3rd parties such as Disqus to handle this functionality for you. Then, I will be sharing my users’ data with the 3rd party, and they may use it who knows how, and for the benefit of who (most likely, not my users’). Since I care about privacy, that’s a big no for me.</p><p>As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it.</p><p>I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community! So, as Matt says, there are things the Jamstack can handle. But certainly not everything. And possibly, not the one(s) that enable your your website to become successful.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The first step is to <strong>create a socket</strong> and set the desired <strong>socket options</strong>. Next you have to <strong>bind</strong> the socket to a specific address. An <em>address</em> in socket programming is a combination of an IP address and a port number. After the socket is bound to an address, the server can listen to incoming connections of clients.</p>

<h2>Writing a Lisp server</h2>
<p>Let's start by writing a simple server in Lisp. Note that this code won't work just yet, follow along.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>#(</span><span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen</span> <span>server</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First we define two parameters, <strong>address</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. The <strong>address</strong> parameter is a vector respresenting the <em>IP address 0.0.0.0</em>. The <strong>port</strong> parameter is the integer 8080. Binding our socket to this address will let it listen on all IP addresses of the computer we run this program on.</p>
<p>In the <em>start-server</em> function we first create a socket by creating an instance of <em>inet-socket</em>. Next we set the options and then bind it to the address. Finally we start listening on the socket.</p>
<p>Next we have to accept any client connections and handle those connections. For our example we will create a server that will echo everything a client sends and then close the connection.</p>
<p>Let's update our <em>start-server</em> function to accept connections and pass the connection to a handler function. To make reading from the socket a bit easier, I've added a helper function <em>read-from-connection</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>

         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see we had to do some processing of the data received from the socket. Our function <em>read-from-connection</em> reads up to 1024 bytes from the connection. Lisp has to <em>allocate</em> an entire buffer of that length, but only a certain number of bytes are received. So we simple return the part of the buffer equal to the length of the data written.</p>
<p>In the <em>handle-connection</em> function, we read data from the connection using our helper function. Then we simply send that data back to the connection by using the <strong>socket-send</strong> function, and finally close our socket by making use of the <strong>socket-close</strong> function.</p>
<p>To connect to our server you can use the telnet command on your computer:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>michael@winston:~<span>|</span>⇒  telnet <span>127</span>.0.0.1 <span>9000</span>
Trying <span>127</span>.0.0.1...
Connected to <span>127</span>.0.0.1.
Escape character is <span>'^]'</span>.
Lisp is amazing!
Lisp is amazing!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see the telnet commands establishes a connection. We then enter something ("Lisp is amazing!" in my example) and press enter. The server immediately echos back what we sent it and closes the connection.</p>
<p>The complete example up untill now can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">simple echo server</a> file.</p>
<div id="handling-multiple-client-connections">
<h3>Handling multiple client connections</h3>
<p>Our design has one important flaw. Because of the way our server handles connections, only one connection can be handled by our server at a time.</p>
<p>You can test this out by connecting two telnet sessions to our server, just connect but don't send anything just yet. If you send a string to our server on the second telnet session, you won't get an immediate reply. The connection will stay open, without a response, untill the first session is finished. Send something through the first telnet session and you'll notice the second session will get a response and close after the first session does.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the flow of our server, you'll see that our loop that accepts connections is 'kept busy' by our <em>handle-connection</em> function. We can't accept new connections while our <em>handle-connection</em> function hasn't finished. In this particular case, the impact is negligible: since we simple read, send and then close the connection we will quickly return to the loop accepting connections. But image if our connection handler would keep the connection alive and read multiple times from a connection? Bad design!</p>
<p>Luckily, we can easily fix this by starting a new thread for each connection and handle the connection in the new thread.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>sb-thread:make-thread</span>
        <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>; Handle our connection in this lambda, which is run in a new thread</span>
            <span>(</span><span>loop</span>
                <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
                    <span>; Do something with the data received</span>
                    <span>))</span>
            <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>))))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We changed our <em>handle-connection</em> function to make a new thread. That thread will spin off from the main server thread and continue on its own. While the thread is running it's own loop in this case, the server is free to accept new connections that will be handled by threads of their own.</p>
<p>If you test our server with two telnet session like we did before, you'll notice our server now responds as expected. The fact that one client was connected first, but hasn't finished yet, makes no difference when handling a second client.</p>
<p>The full example can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">threaded echo server</a> file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><code><span>io_uring</span></code> is a new asynchronous I/O API for Linux created by Jens Axboe from Facebook. It aims at providing an API without the limitations of the current <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> family of system calls, which we discussed in the previous section. Given that users of asynchronous programming models choose it in the first place for performance reasons, it makes sense to have an API that has very low performance overheads. We shall see how <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves this in subsequent sections.</p><div id="the-io-uring-interface">
<h2>The io_uring interface<a href="#the-io-uring-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The very name io_uring comes from the fact that the interfaces uses ring buffers as the main interface for kernel-user space communication. While there are system calls involved, they are kept to a minimum and there is a polling mode you can use to reduce the need to make system calls as much as possible.</p>

<div id="the-mental-model">
<h3>The mental model<a href="#the-mental-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mental model you need to construct in order to use <code><span>io_uring</span></code> to build programs that process I/O asynchronously is fairly simple.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are 2 ring buffers, one for submission of requests (submission queue or SQ) and the other that informs you about completion of those requests (completion queue or CQ).</p></li>
<li><p>These ring buffers are shared between kernel and user space. You set these up with <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_setup.html#c.io_uring_setup" title="io_uring_setup"><code><span>io_uring_setup()</span></code></a> and then mapping them into user space with 2 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls.</p></li>
<li><p>You tell io_uring what you need to get done (read or write a file, accept client connections, etc), which you describe as part of a submission queue entry (SQE) and add it to the tail of the submission ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You then tell the kernel via the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> system call that you’ve added an SQE to the submission queue ring buffer. You can add multiple SQEs before making the system call as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> can also wait for a number of requests to be processed by the kernel before it returns so you know you’re ready to read off the completion queue for results.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel processes requests submitted and adds completion queue events (CQEs) to the tail of the completion queue ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You read CQEs off the head of the completion queue ring buffer. There is one CQE corresponding to each SQE and it contains the status of that particular request.</p></li>
<li><p>You continue adding SQEs and reaping CQEs as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>polling mode available</span></a>, in which the kernel polls for new entries in the submission queue. This avoids the system call overhead of calling <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> every time you submit entries for processing.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div><div id="io-uring-performance">
<h2>io_uring performance<a href="#io-uring-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because of the shared ring buffers between the kernel and user space, io_uring can be a zero-copy system. Copying bytes around becomes necessary when system calls that transfer data between kernel and user space are involved. But since the bulk of the communication in <code><span>io_uring</span></code> is via buffers shared between the kernel and user space, this huge performance overhead is completely avoided. While system calls (and we’re used to making them a lot) may not seem like a significant overhead, in high performance applications, making a lot of them will begin to matter. Also, system calls are not as cheap as they used to be. Throw in workarounds the operating system has in place to deal with <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Specter and Meltdown</a>, we are talking non-trivial overheads. So, avoiding system calls as much as possible is a fantastic idea in high-performance applications indeed.</p>
<p>While using synchronous programming interfaces or even when using asynchronous programming interfaces under Linux, there is at least one system call involved in the submission of each request. In <code><span>io_uring</span></code>, you can add several requests, simply by adding multiple SQEs each describing the I/O operation you want and make a single call to io_uring_enter. For starers, that’s a win right there. But it gets better.</p>
<p>You can have the kernel poll and pick up your SQEs for processing as you add them to the submission queue. This avoids the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> call you need to make to tell the kernel to pick up SQEs. For high-performance applications, this means even lesser system call overheads. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>the submission queue polling tutorial</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p>With some clever use of shared ring buffers, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> performance is really memory-bound, since in polling mode, we can do away with system calls altogether. It is important to remember that performance benchmarking is a relative process with some kind of a common point of reference. According to the <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring paper</a>, on a reference machine, in polling mode, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> managed to clock 1.7M 4k IOPS, while <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> manages 608k. Although much more than double, this isn’t a fair comparison since <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> doesn’t feature a polled mode. But even when polled mode is disabled, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> hits 1.2M IOPS, close to double that of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a>.</p>
<p>To check the raw throughput of the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface, there is a no-op request type. With this, on the reference machine, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves 20M messages per second. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-liburing/submission.html#c.io_uring_prep_nop" title="io_uring_prep_nop"><code><span>io_uring_prep_nop()</span></code></a> for more details.</p>
</div><div id="an-example-using-the-low-level-api">
<h2>An example using the low-level API<a href="#an-example-using-the-low-level-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing a small program that reads files and prints them on to the console, like how the Unix <code><span>cat</span></code> utility does might be a good starting point to get your hands wet with the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API. Please see the next chapter for one such example.</p>
</div><div id="just-use-liburing">
<h2>Just use liburing<a href="#just-use-liburing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While being acquainted with the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API is most certainly a good thing, in real, serious programs you probably want to use the higher-level interface provided by liburing. Programs like <a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> already use it. If liburing never existed, you’d have built some abstraction layer over the low-lever <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface. liburing does that for you and it is a well thought-out interface as well. In short, you should probably put in some effort to understand how the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface works, but by default you should really be using <code><span>liburing</span></code> in your programs.</p>
<p>While there is a reference section here for it, there are some examples based on <code><span>liburing</span></code> we’ll see in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL has become a widely adopted standard over the past few years. However, not everyone is taking advantage of the full capabilities of the standard. In this article, I’ll demonstrate methods for creating more expressive schemas that better fit your data needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start by defining an example scenario. We’re building a forum application, which will have several types of users:</p><ul role="list"><li>Standard users that post and read content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Moderators that oversee forum postings and police activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Administrators that manage the operations of the forum. For example, dealing with technical issues, assigning moderators, and more.</li></ul><p>What might a schema for such a site look like? Let’s start off with a barebones schema. This example will be using a Node Express and GraphQL project. I’ll assume you already know how to do that, but I will include the entire project code at the bottom of the article later. Create a typeDefs.ts file like this. Notice that we’re using TypeScript, since the type annotations help make the code more clear.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
import { gql } from "apollo-server-express"; 
 
const typeDefs = gql` 
  type StandardUser { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
 
export default typeDefs; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>You’ll notice that we have the three user types, and an additional type called Category, which represents the group that our posts will go into. However it’s clear there is repetition across our fields (e.g. id, username). It’s in fact possible to pull out a “base type” from each of the three user related types. Let’s attempt to do this by updating this schema using Interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Interfaces&nbsp;</h3><p>An interface is just a skeleton of sorts. It’s a contract that declares rules, in this case specific fields, however it has no implementation and therefore cannot return data. Only types can. However since it does provide structure, we are using Interfaces to define base fields and then have our types implement those Interfaces. For example, if we update our typeDefs with Interfaces it could look like this.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
const typeDefs = gql` 
  interface Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
  } 
 
  interface User implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  interface Rating { 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type StandardUser implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator implements Identifiable &amp; User { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>If we start at the top, you’ll see our first interface is called Identifiable. Since all of the entities in our data model have a unique ID, this interface will be the base for all of our entities. Next, we see that the User interface implements the Identifiable interface. Notice how User has both the id field and its own field called userName. When a type or interface implements an interface, they must implement all of its fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next up we have another interface called Rating. Since two of our types StandardUser and Moderator use the stars field, but Administrator does not, we have this interface so that only the types that use the stars field can implement it – otherwise, the User models can skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we finally have our actual types StandardUser, Moderator, and Administrator, where each one implements only the interfaces it needs by using an &amp; symbol to denote more than one interface being implemented. Then lastly the Category type.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see this set of types and hierarchies is quite reminiscent of most modern programming languages, for example TypeScript.</p><p>We now have a reasonable schema model. Let’s try querying it. Update the typeDefs variable by adding this Query.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
type Query { 
    getAllUsers: [User!] 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>As you can see, we’ve added a function that retrieves all of our site’s users, but returns them as an array of Users. Let’s now write our resolver and see if this will work. First create your resolver file like the following:</p><div><pre><code>
import { IResolvers } from "apollo-server-express"; 
import { getAllUsers, User } from "../dataService"; 
import { GqlContext } from "./GqlContext"; 
 
const resolvers: IResolvers = { 
  Query: { 
    getAllUsers: async ( 
      parent, 
      args: null, 
      ctx: GqlContext, 
      info: any 
	): Promise<array<user>&gt; =&gt; { 
      return getAllUsers(); 
	}, 
  }, 
}; 
 
export default resolvers; 
</array<user></code>
</pre></div><p>Our resolver’s only action is to call our getAllUsers function in order to retrieve the actual data. You’ll notice that our getAllUsers resolver is returning an array of User Interfaces. This should be a bit suspicious, but for now let’s just see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must implement the getAllUsers function in code. But to make this article simpler and focus on GraphQL we’ll create a function that returns hard coded values. Create a file called dataService.ts and add this code.</p><div><pre><code>
import { v4 } from "uuid"; 
 
export interface Identifiable { 
  id: string; 
} 
 
export interface User extends Identifiable { 
  userName: string; 
} 
 
export interface Rating { 
  stars: number; 
} 
 
export class StandardUser implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Moderator implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number, 
    public categories: [Category] 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Administrator implements User { 
  constructor(public id: string, public userName: string) {} 
} 
 
export class Category implements Identifiable { 
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {} 
} 
 
export function getAllUsers() { 
  const users: Array<user> = []; 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "dave", 4)); 
  users.push(new Moderator(v4(), "ruth", 5, [new Category(v4(), "Cooking")])); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "jane", 5)); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "tom", 1)); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "linda")); 
  users.push( 
    new Moderator(v4(), "tom", 2, [new Category(v4(), "Programming")]) 
  ); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "betty")); 
 
  return users; 
} 
</user></code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>Our dataService contains all of our TypeScript types that mirror our GraphQL schemas, as well as the getAllUsers function that returns a list of objects that inherit from our User Interface. As you can see, getAllUsers all types of Users, including StandardUsers and Administrators, but since they all implement the User interface (i.e. User is the parent type for all of them), the function’s return type is set as an array of User types. Now let’s try querying it!</p><h3>Querying and Fragments</h3><p>Open your GraphQL playground by opening your browser to the GraphQL server URL, which would be something like http://localhost:&lt;port number&gt;/graphql. Then add this Query as shown.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
query { 
    getAllUsers { 
  	... on User { 
        id 
        userName 
  	} 
	} 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>This is our Query for getAllUsers, but instead of fields we see three periods. What we’re seeing with the “…” is called an inline Fragment. This tells the GraphQL service which type of data we are looking for. In this case we indicate that we want the Interface User and its fields of id and userName.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s try and run this Query, but when we do we get this error shown.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-b158e79301e4-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def7201d623778ea438_PIIAWDJ_AhMP0A-vvcjwUNoHCg_WvzU_ih_MejA2hzeijfi7RI3lHvNq5pXadUM2JbGzIVoT0Ny2XqAveRkYRh7ow7xWHMnBfFIIkg6g0iXm9uHKclOT1FdRUyMomCxlR0xJr80.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.6 First query error&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>What does this error mean? If we look back at our definition of GraphQL Interfaces we said they only have declarations, but no implementations. Therefore, we need to replace the interface with an implementation of the interface, the type, that does return data. Let’s see how to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Update the resolvers variable by adding this code.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
User: { 
    __resolveType(obj: any, ctx: GqlContext, info: any) { 
      if (obj.categories) { 
        return "Moderator"; 
  	} else if (obj.stars) { 
        return "StandardUser"; 
  	} 
 
      return "Administrator"; 
	}, 
  }, 
</code>
</pre></div><p>By defining the User Interface in our resolvers we are telling GraphQL that when it encounters the User in a Query it should instead return one of the specific types listed. Note, the logic of how to go about determining this is entirely up to you. However an obvious potential way of doing this would be to use member fields unique to each type, as we have done here.&nbsp;</p><p>So now when we run the same Query again we get this.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-2d373c8cffc7-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2defabcf9fda1c9bfe3c_ftxvQYJCQ3OAPpkHSZnuVL7jXMEfunX-V0p_R8ZSuXgZ2rx7WK4QzdCqH_eZJ34YFMjBO9kNz9SXa7ndzlfLx5ryJ9CAzIz7P4q-660SjiLv9BQ8pImbQkcNQtw5-0nk45evL9M.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.8 Second query updated attempt&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Clearly this works, but we’re not getting all the related fields and it’s hard to tell which type each returned item is. Let’s update our query a bit to show these details.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-f491df54febb-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def420f9a0f6c80d8c8_2SHnrjaNjXyK0u6aUR7Hz8ljFO-tgQzGVFWgEpOiM6fdGPwDDLHO06pfgwfzBt53FVEvjGY-cIqhfwt8oO3AqgfyNT2gShd68HhW-XkaXgbZ_pA-ZqG1-S4XklcIbrqENkCmbH4.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.9 Updated Query</figcaption></figure><p>If we go over this Query, we can see that by using the __typename field we get back the type name of every item in our result set. So that definitely helps clarify things somewhat. However only the StandardUser type is returning actual fields. The other types are indicated, but their type-specific data is blank! It’s clear what we need to do so let’s take a stab at it.</p><figure id="w-node-56558d760f7a-f078b551"><p><img alt="TextDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def278d58389665c636_mXZsK_WO2ymnwnCq5GMq2xctdvRhmQ3JdCo_QBrHR_K2ldFKc5T4cKUkP_eqioXJWYxdqIMN3Dlv5eECYPpgN_rxwzOJRIZLS3Pe18d353X1DuYVtKamXiEoJp1q9DbJmbY37gE.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.10 Updated Query with all types&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you probably guessed, we needed to add our other types and their specific fields. For example, in the case of Moderator we have a unique field called categories, Since the category is its own type as well, we also specified the “name” member from the type.</p><p>Now we’ve got everything working! Alas, there’s one small issue. Even after implementing such robust types, we’re still repeating the id and userName fields multiple times. In this case, it doesn’t matter much. But for larger data models, it’s quite easy to have dozens of shared fields – imagine specific all those fields repeatedly!</p><p>We’ve already seen how we can use inline …</p></div></div>

                <p>We’re uncovering the Armory Agent for Kubernetes: a more flexible, scalable, and secure way for Spinnaker to interact with your Kubernetes infrastructure.</p>

<p>Spinnaker monitors your Kubernetes infrastructure constantly so it can display the infrastructure to users, know how to version your services, and more. Spinnaker reaches out to each cluster, retrieves all the Kubernetes objects it is configured to, computes various relationships, and stores the result in its cache.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png"></p>
<p>While powerful, this unobtrusive discovery mechanism has given rise two types of issues when handling a larger number (100s or 1000s) of Kubernetes clusters: <strong>performance and account management</strong>.</p>
<h2>Caching Performance</h2>
<p>With a large number of clusters, performance can be degraded as the same data is retrieved over and over – even when nothing has changed. Spinnaker repeats the process for each cluster and each namespace<sup>1</sup>. The Agent takes a different approach, listening to changes at the cluster level and streaming them back to Spinnaker. Changes to your infrastructure – whether Spinnaker initiated or not – show up in “real time” in Spinnaker’s cache, all over a single TCP connection per cluster.</p>
<h2>Using the Cache</h2>
<p>The Agent also comes with an optimized storage that allows some nice performance improvements – made possible by adopting Kubernetes and RDBMS-specific storage.</p>
<p>Below are some examples we saw during the development of the agent:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png" alt="" width="768" height="663" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-360x311.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics.png 912w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png"></p>
<h2>Account Management</h2>
<p>In its <a href="#agent-mode">Agent mode</a>, the Agent simplifies Kubernetes account management within Spinnaker. Instead of a centralized account management model, where all of your Kubernetes service accounts and credentials are stored within Spinnaker, the Agent sits within each Kubernetes cluster and manages accounts from there. This enables individual teams to manage credentials and permissions for their respective clusters, and allows you to add or delete new accounts on the fly without restarting Spinnaker.</p>
<h2>Added Bonus: Enhanced Security</h2>
<p>The Agent provides an added bonus by enhancing security. It allows you to keep your Kubernetes API servers private from Spinnaker, and restricts the information leaving the cluster to only what Spinnaker needs to operate. Individual teams can also easily rotate or remove Kubernetes configs as needed.</p>


<p>The Agent acts as Spinnaker’s gateway to Kubernetes. It comes in two parts: a lightweight Golang program that gives you a lot of deployment flexibility – we’ll get back to that shortly – and a plugin to Spinnaker. Let’s set it up in our Spinnaker installation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png"></p>
<p>Installing the Agent is straightforward, especially if you already use the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/installation/operator/">Spinnaker Operator</a>. Follow the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-agent/armory-agent-quick/">quick start</a>, and deploy:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plugin to Clouddriver: this will be what the Agent will connect to. A new (gRPC) port will be open.</li>
<li>a <code>Service</code> that points to Clouddriver’s gRPC port.</li>
<li>a <code>Deployment</code> of the Agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above configuration, you’d just define accounts in the Agent – not in Clouddriver anymore. With a simple bit of yaml, a HELM chart, or a kustomize template, teams can inject the Agent&nbsp; into newly provisioned Kubernetes clusters and immediately make them a software deployment targets. Like other parts of Spinnaker, the Agent fully implements secret management so you can store your <code>kubeconfig</code> files in one of the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/secrets/#supported-secret-engines">supported secret engines</a> or just provision them via the method of your choice as Kubernetes secrets.</p>
<p>The Agent will also detect configuration changes and reload the list of accounts immediately. So we could keep updating agent accounts in a separate <code>configMap</code>.<br>
<a name="agent-mode"></a></p>

<p>The great thing with cloud providers – or with a dose of infrastructure automation – is that it’s easy to spin up new Kubernetes clusters. We see application teams more and more in charge of their own infrastructure. In this context, deploying with Spinnaker often becomes a game of cat and mouse to get your cluster information into the hands of the ops team.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of tooling developed over the years. What if we could skip that step? Behold! That’s why it’s called Armory Agent for Kubernetes</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png" alt="" width="768" height="411" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-1024x548.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-360x193.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png"><em>“for” Kubernetes is because lawyers and trademark.</em></p>
<p>In this mode, the Agent is installed in the deployment target cluster by the provisioning tool (e.g. Terraform) – alongside your monitoring and logging infrastructure – or separately via scripts.</p>
<p>The Agent is also configured with Spinnaker’s endpoint and the proper authentication (mTLS, JWT, …). When it starts, it will register to Spinnaker and the account will automatically be available for caching and deployment.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the cluster is deleted – or if you just uninstall the Agent, the account will be removed from Spinnaker after a grace period.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud/">Armory Cloud</a>, Armory’s new SaaS offering. It is a big reason we doubled down on the Agent. With the Agent and the model above, Armory can help you deploy to your infrastructure (public or private), does not need any credentials, and can be revoked at anytime by customers.</p>
<p>A different strategy is to manage groups of clusters. This can be useful in an environment where the control plane does not have direct access to your cluster but cluster information is still centralized. But it can also be helpful to group clusters geographically close, belonging to the same business unit, or with a similar network topology.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png" alt="" width="768" height="417" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-1024x557.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-360x196.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-1536x835.png 1536w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png"></p>

<p>If you’re interested, please <a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-spinnaker-as-a-service/">reach out</a>. We’re in early release and now is your time to help shape the deployment service of your dreams.</p>

<p>The Agent is currently in Early Release and is being used by select Armory customers. We’re encouraged with our early results and are iterating quickly. The Agent is compatible with Armory Spinnaker as well as open source Spinnaker, so please <a href="https://www.armory.io/contact-us/">reach out</a> if you want to take it for a spin. Also, join us for a <a href="https://spinnakersummit2020.sched.com/event/fND7"><span>lunch &amp; learn</span></a><span> about the Agent on 11/4 during the </span><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/"><span>Spinnaker Summit and Gardening Days.</span></a></p>
<p><em>Footnotes:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Fortunately, Spinnaker is highly instrumented and if you know what metrics to watch for, there is surely a knob to turn to correct it. Note that there is an effort currently underway to improve the situation and we expect Spinnaker caching performance to greatly improve over the next few releases!</em></p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is very common that we want to compute an integral for some $f(x)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[I = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx\]

</p><p>However, in some circumstances, the analytical result of the expected value might not be derived easily if $f(x)$ is very complex.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to compute an integral approximately using Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="law-of-large-numbers">Law of Large Numbers</h4>

<p>Law of large numbers states that for random variable $X$ with $\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu$ and $\mathbb{Var}[X] = \sigma^2$ and we also have a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, the sample average random variable</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\]

</p><p>converges to $\mu$</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_{n} \rightarrow \mu, \text{ when } n \rightarrow \infty\]

</p><p>This means that for any random variable, if the number of random samples is sufficiently large, the average of random samples from the i.i.d random variables will be sure to be the population mean $\mu$.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>, except that the law of large numbers did not tell the distribution of sample average random variable will become a Gaussian distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</p>



<p>Therefore, to estimate $\mathbb{E}[X]$, we prepare $n$ random samples $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ from i.i.d random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, and $n$ is sufficiently large.</p><p>

\[\mathbb{E}[X] \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\]

</p><h3 id="riemann-integral-and-riemann-sum">Riemann Integral and Riemann Sum</h3>

<h4 id="riemann-integral">Riemann Integral</h4>

<p>Riemann integral is actually the definition of the definite integral.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = \lim_{||\Delta x|| \rightarrow 0}^{} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>

<h4 id="riemann-sum">Riemann Sum</h4>

<p>Following Riemann integral, Riemann sum provides a way to compute the definite integral approximately.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>



<p>As a special case of Riemann sum, suppose the volume of $\Omega$ is $V$, where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We evenly divided the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, then $\Delta x_i = \frac{V}{n}$. We further set $x_i^{\ast} = x_i$. We have the Riemann sum</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \frac{V}{n} \\
&amp;= \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The advantage of Monte Carlo integration over Riemann sum is that for some $\Omega$ it is easier to do random sampling in $\Omega$ than evenly diving $\Omega$.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-integration">Monte Carlo Integration</h3>

<p>Monte Carlo integration is somewhat similar to Riemann sum. However, instead of evenly dividing the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, we randomly sample $x_i$ from $\Omega$. The expression of the formula remains almost the same as the special case of Riemann sum we discussed above though.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>and $x_i$ is a random sample of $X_i$ which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables defined in $\Omega$ that follows <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>By definition, we have the expected value for an arbitrary function.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We set $p(x) = \frac{1}{V}$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} \frac{1}{V} f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{V} \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = V \mathbb{E}[f(X)]\]

</p><p>According to the law of large numbers, since $f(X)$ is a random variable, $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ could be computed approximately by sampling. That is to say, we have $n$ i.i.d random variables, $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, and we randomly sample $f(x_1), f(x_2), \cdots, f(x_n)$ for $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, respectively. To do such sampling for $f(X_i)$, we sample $x_i$ for $X_i$ uniformly from $\Omega$, following by computing $f(x_i)$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;= V \mathbb{E}[f(X)] \\
&amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Here we would take a look at the applications of Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h4 id="compute-pi-approximately">Compute $\pi$ Approximately</h4>

<p>To be honest, I have totally forgotten how $\pi$ is formally computed. However, with some prior knowledge about $\pi$ and circle, we could compute $\pi$ approximately.</p>



<p>We define a circle whose center is located at $(0,0)$ with a radius of $r = 1$. Formally, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. With our prior knowledge, we know the area of this circle is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
S &amp;= \pi r^2 \\
&amp;= \pi
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, to compute $\pi$ approximately, we just have to compute the area of the circle approximately.</p>



<p>We define $\Omega = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and a function $f(x, y)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x, y) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{else}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
I &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy \\
&amp;= S \times 1 \\
&amp;= S \\
&amp;= \pi \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that the integral $I$ is actually the volume of a cylinder which equals to $\pi$, instead of the area of the circle.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\pi = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy\]

</p><p>To compute the integral approximately, we could either use Riemann sum or Monte Carlo integration. Here we use Monte Carlo integration to compute the integral.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
V &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} dx dy \\
&amp;= 4
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could then write a compute program to help us finish the following sampling tasks.</p>

<p><span>When Yang made the announcement people were stunned. The Cato Institute slipped their children cyanide pills. Held their hands while they convulsed and foamed and slipped mercifully into the night. Chelsea Handler set herself on fire. Even the channers couldn’t believe it– and it was them who’d made it happen. But I signed up the next day. It was like my prayers were heard.</span><span id="more-6287"></span></p>
<p><span>Incel had taken out Amazon. Not the whole thing at once– but they’d figured out that you could get an RC chopper at the hobby store. A pack of model rocket engines. Ten Incel fedayeen could blow up transformers next to <i>Fulfillment Centers</i> any given day and that was that. Hundreds of millions vanished. Workers evacuated but still paid as Bezos’ fingers clenched futilely around that precious seven dollars an hour slipping away. And, importantly, no <i>Value Added. </i>No tax collected on every robot delivered package. Every self-driving truck mile. Google and Facebook didn’t even need a bomb. They were ad sales operations. Someone found their real data, sent it to their clients. No tax on every click. Zuckerberg retired to his acreage in Hawaii to live out his days diving. He’d caught the business end of a Portuguese man o’ war. Priscilla had made it through med school. But appearing distraught was the hardest thing she’d ever done.</span></p>
<p><span>For the first time in history, the unlaid were organized. People had had Freedom Dividends six months. Now taking it away meant murder. And there, one day, on Jack Dorsey’s hacked Twitter after an introductory FUCK N*GGERS, was a <i>list of demands. </i>It was one item long.</span></p>
<p><span><i>We want GFs</i></span></p>
<p><span>Yang caved. I was 45. My mother had stopped asking about girlfriends. Then about pets. Then about anything but suicidal ideation. I’d voted for Yang. Donated. Even though his signs needled me at night. <i>DO THE MATH</i>. Ever increasing odds of my middle aged sperm causing autism. The math said I’d grow old and die. Never hold my first child. Or I’d spend my days fighting him off as he bit me savagely for moving his oscillating fan. My own fault. Sometimes I’d think of her<i>. </i>Maybe text. Thinking I shouldn’t have let go. She’d text back. I remembered why I did.</span></p>
<p><span>The system was National E-Harmony. You punched in stats about yourself. It found you one match, one time. <i>Math</i>. A woman who dated her match two years could quintuple her Freedom Dividend. <i>It’s national sex trafficking,</i> said Rachel Maddow, rasping like male hope was cutting off her air. It didn’t matter. Cable news viewers averaged 78 years old. By the next election they’d be dead.</span></p>
<p><span>You punched in stats and she did too and the system gave her your address and one morning the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>Hi, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Hi.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m Jocelyn.</span></p>
<p><span>She looked Irish. That was the first problem. Under 38, over 32. I don’t want to fuck her, I thought. I specifically said Asian. But no, fucking isn’t the point here. Do you want to come in.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d rather not, until we know each other.</span></p>
<p><span>Jesus Christ is she rejecting me already. 5 grand a month not enough to get a woman in my apartment. Yeah of course, I’ll uh come out– did you have trouble finding the place?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>OK well thanks for coming–</span></p>
<p><span>Well it was mandated by the government, she said. She wasn’t bad looking. She smiled, and I remembered I wasn’t either.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>I took her to the duck pond near my apartment. They’d have given me someone who likes birds. I’d mentioned it 10 times in the form. There was a mating pair of ruddy ducks. The small auburn male with his bright blue bill stood on a rock, preening. Diligently pushing air out from his feathers to reduce buoyancy. The longer he can stay underwater, the more small crustaceans he can find, I explained. So you’re into ducks, she said. It didn’t sound like good news.</span></p>
<p><span>Nature helps me find peace.</span></p>
<p><span>And you write self help books.</span></p>
<p><span>Self-<i>published</i> books, they’re about, like– they don’t help people<i>. </i>They actually got flagged when the Incel stuff started–</span></p>
<p><span>Wait, are they like bad? Omigod are you <i>alt r–</i></span></p>
<p><span>No, no. It’s just, very honest about sex stuff, society</span></p>
<p><span>And you don’t have a job. You make a living from the books.</span></p>
<p><span>That and the Freedom Dividend, yes.</span></p>
<p><span>Are you going to ask what I do?</span></p>
<p><span>OK</span></p>
<p><span>I’m a writer too. That’s why they matched us.</span></p>
<p><span>She was pitching pilots for <i>streaming</i>, she explained. Or perhaps I’ll get <i>on staff</i> somewhere, but for now my agent’s waiting to hear back from Quibble–</span></p>
<p><span>Is that–</span></p>
<p><span>They have a billion dollars for <i>development</i> from Dubai. But I also do a lot of work in <i>branded</i>. And with nonprofits. And I’m producing an unscripted series where young women of color rescue dogs using robotics they built. That’s for Comcast.</span></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t sound like you need money.</span></p>
<p><span>Well none of it’s paying me. But I just did this to see who they gave me.</span></p>
<p><span>What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span>I asked for someone passionate about food. Travel. Someone passionate about racial justice–</span></p>
<p><span>I asked for an Asian.</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, because you want a submissive little wife?</span></p>
<p><span>No, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Y564JC">tight pussy</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>I waited. And she did laugh.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>She moved in in January with her black Great Dane, Dante. I threw out the antibiotics I’d been hoarding in the medicine cabinet to make room for her pills. The SSRI made it hard for her to cum. It took an hour with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1790356229">two cramped fingers hooked into her</a> and my jaw starting to ache. Feeling like a medieval woodcut of a peasant plowing dry fields, while Death looms over his shoulder. Half the time I’d apologize. Take a walk, frustrated. Leave her alone with the dog. But she said without them she wasn’t herself.</span></p>
<p><span>It was hard, but she was mine. In September I asked her about taking the IUD out. It always made me feel like a weasel had bitten me. And she said maybe. Maybe soon. You’re so good with Dante.</span></p>
<p><span>Then her pilot got picked up.</span></p>
<p><span>She got a Wikipedia entry. <i>Jocelyn Finnegan is an American actress, writer, producer, personality and activist. </i>Be careful, I joked with her. You have a Wikipedia, you’ll want to leave me for a guy with a bigger Wikipedia. And he’ll want to leave you for his 22 year old Asian intern. She just glared. That’s kind of racist, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t mean it that way.</span></p>
<p><span>You know my agent asked about your books.</span></p>
<p><span>Oh yeah?</span></p>
<p><span>Not like that. She’s worried they’ll be a story. They could be a problem for me.</span></p>
<p><span>I asked why, but I knew. Because they’re kind of <i>hateful</i>, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>They’re not hateful–</span></p>
<p><span>You said “fuck the Jews.”</span></p>
<p><span>Not <i>all</i> of them</span></p>
<p><span>Well what do you think Buzzfeed would think of that. You think it’s funny but people read this stuff and they become racist. People like you are why Brexit happened. Racists–</span></p>
<p><span>Brexit was about Polish people– are they not white</span></p>
<p><span>You <i>spread hate</i> and those <i>fucking people</i> read it and <i>that’s why we had Trump–</i></span></p>
<p><span>Jesus Christ can you let it go? He’s gone.</span></p>
<p><span>Yeah just like Voldemort was gone</span></p>
<p><span>Oh my fucking God is this real–</span></p>
<p><span>How can you not get this, she said. You think you’re fucked up because you were alone so long. But you were alone because you’re so fucked up. I’m leaving.</span></p>
<p><span>We have a year left</span></p>
<p><span>I’m requesting a transfer for abuse. They’ll give me the money prorated. Please, just don’t make this hard. If you ever cared about me, just sign–</span></p>
<p><span>I said yes. I was 46.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know what happened to her. The pilot didn’t go to series. I think she froze her eggs. I haven’t become a story, yet.</span></p>
<p><span>Since my last partner filed the papers I was ineligible to reapply. This was not uncommon. Less than 9% of couples stayed together for the jackpot. Most partnerships terminated for abuse claims.</span></p>
<p><span>A year later I spent my last Freedom Dividend. Hard to find the right material. Amazon wouldn’t ship what you needed. Am I fucked up from being alone so long. Or am I alone because I’m so fucked up.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back it never could have worked. Me and her, or any of it. The world moved on. The normal inherited the Earth. They saw us as the enemy. The last pocket of retrograde evil in a society moving toward sexless pet care utopia. And she was right. I did say hateful things. I did help cause problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry for that. And for what I’m about to do.</span></p>

<p><strong>Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Incremental computation is a programming abstraction which gives users a way of writing calculations such that, when some of the inputs change, only a relevant subset of the calculation has to be recomputed. </p>
<p>The above definition is kind of vague and honestly it's best to start with an example. Let's take a look at the following mathematical expression.  </p>
<p>$$ (a+b)*c $$</p>
<p>We can evaluate this expression in two steps. First by adding a and b together, and then by multiplying the result by c. We can even write this computation out as a dependency graph:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
Here the variables a, b, c are referred to as leaves because they have no dependencies. Now what if after we do our initial computation, the value of c changes?
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag-2.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
We can see from this graph that since (a+b) does not depend on c, we do not need to recompute it. Now imagine scaling this idea up to larger, more complex expressions. If you are familiar with spreadsheet software, you might have flashbacks to the huge interlinked computations created there. This brings us to a second, more intuitive definition of incremental computation: Microsoft Excel on steroids.
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/excel-on-steroids.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
There are several different frameworks and projects for incremental computation. These include <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">several</a> <a href="http://adapton.org/">rust</a> <a href="https://github.com/lord/anchors">libraries</a>, <a href="http://skiplang.com/">Facebook's Skip Lang</a> and an OCaml library called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>. I chose to play around with Incremental for my experiments, because it seems to be the most battle tested option.</p>
<p><strong>Pros/Cons</strong><br>
So far it may seem like incremental computation frameworks are magical abstractions which allow programmers to write incredibly efficient programs with ease. So why don't we all use them? Well like most things in software, incremental computation frameworks come with a few trade offs. <br>
Pros:  </p>
<ul>
<li>An incremental computation framework provides a simple abstraction around optimizing computations which allow programmers to write more efficiently computable programs with low mental overhead.</li>
<li>The abstraction provided by these frameworks generalizes well to many different types of problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frameworks have non negligible overhead both in speed and memory. We need to make sure the computation is slow enough to justify incrementalizing. If not, the overhead of the framework could dwarf the time it would take to recompute the expression from scratch.</li>
<li>Similar to the above point, the initial computation of the algorithm will be slower. You need to decide if you will be recomputing often enough to justify this slow down.</li>
<li>There are always limitations to any particular abstraction. Therefore you will likely be able to come up with a custom algorithm for a specific problem that is much faster than the result you get using an incremental computation framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those interested in exploring these tradeoffs in detail or wanting to peek behind the curtain will enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6a5G5i4gQU">this talk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do people use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
So where are people actually using incremental computation? As far as I know, there are a few different areas where these ideas are being applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance, especially to deal with large spreadsheet-like calculations. Most finance companies are a little vague about what they actually do, so I don't know too much about this use case.</li>
<li>Compliers, the rust compiler explored these techniques when building their incremental compilation features.</li>
<li>Databases, the company <a href="https://materialize.io/">Materialize</a> uses technology based on the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/courses/2015/6.S897/readings/naiad.pdf">Timely Dataflow Model</a> developed by Microsoft Research to create a better streaming database.</li>
<li>User Interfaces, user interfaces are a perfect place for incremental computation because it's important to figure out which components you actually need to re-render when something on the page changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How people shouldn't use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Now we can get to the fun part. Over the last week, I tried to play around with Incremental (and picked up scraps of OCaml) to get a better idea of how to actually build incremental computations. </p>
<p>Of course the first thing I did was to <a href="https://github.com/Mr4k/smash-incremental-heap">break the library</a>, but after that I decided I wanted to write a small but non trivial project which used it. Since I don't have legions of highly paid quants to create large spreadsheets, I decided that use case was off the table. I felt that building a toy compiler or database would be at least a week long project by itself without incrementalizing it, so I ruled those out as well. I'm also not a huge frontend person, so a ui framework didn't seem appeal to me that much. Instead I decided to try something different:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/in-one-weekend.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>I decided to implement (3/4s of) Peter Shirley's <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf">Ray Tracing in One Weekend tutorial</a> in OCaml and then try to incrementalize a part of the ray tracing step. I will be honest, this experiment was not the most amazing thing in the world, but I think I learned a lot about what not to do with incremental computation. </p>
<p>Is this a terrible idea? Absolutely! But we can learn a lot but understanding why exactly it's terrible.</p>
<p>So how does the graph based incremental computation I talked about above even fit in with ray tracing? It turns out shooting light rays into space can be thought of as a graph.</p>
<p>First of all let's look the process of tracing one ray of light from observer to light source.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/inital-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above diagram, we can see a ray of light traced backwards from the viewers eye to a light source. In between, it bounces off of both a red and blue sphere.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/ray-trace-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>The light blue circles are nodes in an incremental computation graph and the arrows are directed edges between them. Whenever a ray hits an object, a new incremental node is created. This node computes the location of the next bounce by reflecting the incoming ray, and depends on the location and direction of the last bounce. This means that if the direction of a previous ray in the chain changes, all subsequent ray bounces will be recomputed.</p>
<p>We can also fit additional metadata about our scene into the graph. For example, each object that a light ray hits will have a material associated with it.</p>
<p>In my model, these materials have color but also a "fuzziness" parameter that represents how reflective the material is. If the material is perfectly reflective, incoming light rays are reflected so that the angle of incedence is exactly equal to the angle of reflection. Otherwise there is a random jitter applied to the outgoing direction of the ray. The size of this jitter is controlled by the "fuzziness" parameter. </p>
<p>So the material parameters affect the final image color, as well as the direction of the outgoing ray. When the fuzziness of a material changes, we must recast all subsequent rays bouncing off of any objects which use that material. We can represent this dependency in our graph as follows: </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/render-graph-with-materials.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above graph, if the fuzziness of a material changes, we will recast all subsequent rays.</p>
<p>Handling changing material parameters will be the focus of our render. The idea is that after an expensive render, an artist could tweak a few material parameters without having to redraw the entire screen.</p>
<p>But what about moving objects around? For this experiment, I decided not to implement this (fairly important) feature because I could not find a way to make it fit as nicely into the abstraction provided by Incremental. If I really wanted to do this, I'd basically just store all the rays inside a spatial acceleration structure like a octree. Then whenever a sphere's position changed, I'd query the set of rays intersecting it before and after it moved. I'd then recompute each of the nodes associated with these rays.  </p>
<p>So anyways does this material editing approach actually work? The answer is somewhat.</p>
<p>Here's a gif of it in action (in real time)!
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/trace-reload.gif" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>In the above gif, each material's color and fuzziness parameters are being changed one sphere at a time. Instead of doing a full render each time something changes, Incremental figures out which rays need to be recomputed. The image above looks grainy because I'm casting only about 10 rays per pixel (for reference,  Shirley's code, which this is based off, does 100 rays per pixel). To see why I'm only taking 10 samples per pixel, let's look at some performance numbers: </p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th># Rays Cast (x129600)</th>
    <th>Non incremental render time (s) </th>
    <th>Inital incremental render time (s) </th>
    <th>50th percentile edit time (s)</th>

    <td>5x</td>
    <td>4.088101</td>
    <td>12.362720</td>
    <td>0.032054</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20x</td>
    <td>14.815373</td>
    <td>121.544599</td>
    <td>0.840104</td>
    <td>11.20906</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30x</td>
    <td>19.766822</td>
    <td>311.603921</td>
    <td>1.917536</td>
    <td>24.662991</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The benchmarks above are all taken on my 2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 2015 Macbook Pro with 8GB of memory. They each used 100 spheres, each with its own unique material. Each sphere's material was changed once and I recorded the time it took to rerender after each sphere's material had changed. Each ray cast bounced a maximum of 10 times through the scene. The non incremental version is my implementation of Peter Shirley's code. Both versions of the code are single threaded.</p>
<p>Okay let's talk though this data quickly. The first four rows of the table tell a consistent story. The initial render has about a 3x to 4x overhead and editing a sphere's material results is significantly faster than a full redraw. All the numbers seem to scale linearly with the number of rays cast as expected.</p>
<p>But what about the rows after that? Runtime seems to explode in the incremental version. I was really surprised by this result. I don't have a definitive answer to this question but it did make me rethink the overhead that a library like Incremental brings to a program.</p>
<p><strong>Overhead of Incremental</strong><br>
At first glance, accounting for the runtime overhead of Incremental seems like it would be pretty simple. Each node that is fired requires a little bookkeeping on the Incremental side. As far as I know this overhead is typically on the order of ~50-150ns per node on commodity hardware and should grow linearly. The …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p><em>In this article, we break down the ideal architecture for “the complete customer data stack” from the perspective of the data engineer. With new customer data software tools being launched every day and unclear definitions around terms like “customer data platform,” we make the argument that these individual tools are always part of a much more comprehensive customer data stack that should be managed by IT and engineering.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In business software, terms like “unified customer data” and “360º view of the customer” are hot marketing buzzwords. Executives and, of course, salespeople say that these new tools are the best thing since sliced bread.</p>



<p>When it comes to engineering and IT organizations, though, most developers don’t think of fancy marketing software when they consider the subject of unified customer data. Instead, they think about unified data in the context of the data flows, storage, and processing that form their entire customer data pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This disparity in perspective is the unfortunate result of vendors selling to marketing and sales departments and implementing for them. Still, because the entire system isn’t considered, the result is often more siloed data (the opposite of what was promised).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we make the case that the customer data functionality sold by all vendors<em>&nbsp;is just one component (or “use case”) within a broader system for customer data infrastructure –&nbsp;</em>the comprehensive set of tools and functions that collect, manage &amp; activate customer data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our customers described this well when explaining RudderStack as part of their stack:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“This isn’t about the success of RudderStack as an individual service, but the success of this entire effort to get our customer data infrastructure right, which means building data-driven workflows, making smarter decisions based on data and building prediction models for retention and engagement. Not every effort is directly related to the tool, but the tool is a big part of the system we are building.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>These systems are complex, touch multiple business and technical systems both internally &amp; externally and have use cases spanning the organization, from marketing to product to support (and even finance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that IT and engineering teams are best equipped to build this customer data stack.</p>







<h2>First, Let’s Define ‘Customer Data’</h2>







<p>At the risk of pointing out the obvious, at the highest level, any data associated with a customer is customer data, and this concept predates the internet or even computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the advent of computers, businesses used to keep a ledger book of all transactions mostly for accounting &amp; planning purposes. With the advent of computers, the ledger was digitized and stored in databases, but the concept and use cases remained the same.</p>



<p>From those initial days, we have come a long way. Customer relationship management tools (CRMs) like Salesforce were the first “customer data platforms” that reached into multiple parts of the organization. However, as the ability to collect data from every customer touchpoint has become increasingly possible, the concept of a repository of customer records with a UI isn’t enough to meet the needs of truly data-driven companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers are interacting with businesses in more ways than ever before. It’s not just retail stores, but websites, mobile apps, call centers, ticketing systems, and more. Business systems have proliferated to manage and create value from all of the data. Amazingly, a typical mid-sized company uses anywhere from 10-50 tools across their departments to interact with their customers. This includes home-grown systems as well as third-party SaaS solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As any data engineer knows, the most common challenge in the modern environment is that this information about customers is siloed within the tools. Bringing all that data together to create a complete customer “view” is a non-trivial engineering problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solution isn’t a single tool or function, but a comprehensive “customer data stack.”</p>



<p>Based on years of experience building, running, and consuming the output of various pieces of this infrastructure, we’ve mapped out the key components required to build a comprehensive, scalable system that serves the needs of an entire company (what we call “the complete customer data stack”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that there isn’t one vendor who solves every piece of the puzzle. Every company uses multiple tools. Many companies attempt to build these systems from scratch. In contrast, others leverage tools like Segment, <a href="https://rudderstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RudderStack</a>, DBT, Lytics, and others to manage the key components of their data pipeline (especially those that are complicated and/or expensive to build and run).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, note that this architecture is somewhat “aspirational.” Not every company has implemented or is implementing every component of the stack. Requirements for the customer data stack vary depending on the business model and stage of the company. At scale, though, truly data-driven businesses will need the functionality of every component on some level.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and break down the key building blocks of the complete customer data stack. </p>







<h2>Components of the Complete Customer Data Stack</h2>







<p>Here is a diagram that includes all of the key components of a complete customer data stack, from data collection through all of the primary use cases. Below, we break down the function and concerns around each key component.  </p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>







<p>This is the starting point. Customer data is spread across multiple systems across multiple points in the customer journey, and the first job of a customer data stack is to collect it. Customer data comes in many forms, but a few of the most common types are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>User behavior and clickstream events on web &amp; mobile apps (clicks, page views, product searches, account creation, etc.)</li><li>Transactional events in backend systems (financial, etc.)&nbsp;</li><li>Transactional data from customer SaaS apps for marketing, sales and support (emails, tickets, chat, etc.)</li><li>Data from internal applications for marketing, sales, and support</li><li>Structure data from external platforms (Google Ads, Clearbit, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>Beyond these, customer data can also come from key pieces of the engineering stack:</p>



<ul><li>Data Warehouses: Many companies run ETL and ELT jobs from their transactional systems into a warehouse and often include “computed” values.</li><li>AI/ML systems: Companies are increasingly deploying AI/ML systems to compute customer scores, personalized product recommendations, and more. The output of these systems also produces “unique customer data.”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The goal of the collection component is to ingest data from all of these systems. Some data is “pulled” via APIs (e.g., from SaaS sources) while others (e.g., events) are more pushed-based—SDKs are deployed on all the sources, and those SDKs push the events via an API. Bringing data from databases like warehouses introduces additional engineering challenges. The simplest approach is to run a SQL query, but that doesn’t scale well when the volume of events. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture#:~:text=In%20databases%2C%20change%20data%20capture,taken%20using%20the%20changed%20data." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques</a> are alternate solutions to address this volume problem.</p>



<p>No matter the use case, any scalable customer data stack needs to address the challenge of data collection in terms of complexity and scale.</p>







<h3>Data Validation</h3>







<p>Validation is a critical component of the stack because some of the data, particularly event streams coming from mobile/web apps, is often dirty &amp; buggy because of human error, ad-blockers, browser imperfections, developer errors, DoS attacks and more. Dirty data impacts the downstream functionality severely. Thus, it needs to be dealt with carefully or blocked completely, depending on the use case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Validation is often rule-based, but increasingly companies are using AI/ML systems for “learning” the event pattern from historic data and blocking events that don’t match that pattern.</p>



<p>The validation step may also involve calling external APIs. One common validation is email verification—making sure that the email address in a customer event is correct—and this usually involves calling an email validation API.</p>



<p>No matter the use case, the data stack’s validation component is key to feeding the company with clean data, so it needs to be robust and flexible.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Transformation, Enrichment &amp; Identity Resolution</h3>







<p>Once raw data is collected and validated, it often needs to be transformed in some way before being sent to downstream applications. Here are some common use cases: Enriching user records with additional internal data (e.g., complete user profile) or external data (e.g., job title, company name, company size, etc.). This is a massive trend in marketing and sales and often requires tapping into an API service, internal or external.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Removing PII or other sensitive customer data points</li><li>Sampling &amp; filtering events (often to reduce cost in downstream applications consuming the data)</li><li>Mapping labels or headers for unified warehouse tables or communication between downstream SaaS tools</li></ul>



<p>Another important function of the transformation component is identity resolution—mapping all the different identities a user may have (anonymous cookies, device IDs, advertising IDs, email addresses, etc.) into a canonical identifier. Tying all these identities together is a key step in combining all the data about a customer into a unified customer profile. (Add citation)</p>



<p>Depending on the business’s complexity and needs, transformations can be as simple as a few lines of code or require complex use cases for each downstream destination. One thing to keep in mind is that as the …</p></div></section></article></div>

            <p>Parliament calls for future-proof rules on digital services, including online platforms and marketplaces, and for a binding mechanism to tackle illegal content online.</p>

            <div><p>MEPs approved tonight two separate <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/646174/EPRS_BRI(2020)646174_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">â€œlegislative initiativeâ€�</a> reports calling on the Commission to address and tackle current shortcomings in the online environment in its Digital Services Act (DSA) package, due to be presented in December.</p>

<p>The current EU rules for digital services have remained largely unchanged since the e-commerce directive was adopted twenty years ago. With the upcoming package, the European Union aims to shape the digital economy at EU level as well as setting the standards for the rest of the world, as it did with data protection.</p>

<p><strong>Stronger rules to tackle illegal content online </strong></p>

<p>All digital service providers established in third countries must adhere to the DSAâ€™s rules when their services are also aimed at consumers or users in the EU, MEPs say.</p>

<p>A binding â€œnotice-and-actionâ€� mechanism must be set up so that users can notify online intermediaries about potentially illegal online content or activities. This would help online intermediaries to react quickly and be more transparent regarding the actions they have taken on potentially illegal content. Users should be able to seek redress through a national dispute settlement body.</p>

<p>Parliament calls for a strict distinction to be made between illegal content and harmful content (the legal liability regime should concern â€œillegal contentâ€� only as defined in EU or national law).</p>

<p>Platforms should not use upload filters or any form of <em>ex-ante</em> content control for harmful or illegal content. The final decision on whether content is legal or not should instead be taken by an independent judiciary and not by private undertakings, say MEPs.</p>

<p>Harmful content, hate speech and disinformation should be dealt with through enhanced transparency obligations and by helping citizens to acquire media and digital literacy regarding the dissemination of such content.</p>

<p><strong>A safer internet for consumers</strong></p>

<p>The principle of â€œwhat is illegal offline is also illegal onlineâ€�, as well as consumer protection and user safety, should become the future DSAâ€™s â€œguiding principlesâ€�, says Parliament.</p>

<p>Platforms and online intermediation services will need to get better at detecting and taking down false claims and tackling rogue traders, e.g. those selling false medical equipment or dangerous products online, as happened during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>MEPs also call for a new "Know Your Business Customer" principle to be introduced, requiring platforms to check and stop fraudulent companies using their services to sell their illegal and unsafe products and content.</p>

<p>Specific rules to prevent (instead of merely remedy) market failures caused by big platforms must also be tabled to open up markets to new entrants, including SMEs and start-ups, MEPs add. More information on the Internal Market Committeeâ€™s demands, backed by plenary with 571 votes to 26, with 94 abstentions, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200925IPR87924/meps-spell-out-their-priorities-for-the-digital-services-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0181_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Making users less dependent on algorithms </strong></p>

<p>MEPs want to provide users with more control over what they see online, including being able to opt out of content curation altogether, and to make them less dependent on algorithms. Targeted advertising must be regulated more strictly in favour of less intrusive, contextualised forms of advertising that require less data and do not depend on previous user interaction with content. MEPs also call on the Commission to further assess options for regulating targeted advertising, including a phase-out leading to a ban.</p>

<p>The upcoming DSA should also provide for the right to use digital services anonymously whenever possible. Finally, to ensure compliance with the new rules, the Commission should assess options for setting up a European entity to monitor and impose fines. For more details on the Legal Affairs Committee demands approved with 637 votes to 26, with 28 abstentions, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200925IPR87926/digital-services-managing-harmful-content-while-protecting-freedom-of-expression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0177_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fundamental rights online </strong></p>

<p>A third, non-legislative resolution by the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/home/highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil Liberties Committee</a>, approved by 566 votes to 45, with 80 abstentions, focuses on fundamental rights issues. It calls for content removal to be â€œdiligent, proportionate and non-discriminatoryâ€� to safeguard freedom of expression and information, as well as privacy and data protection. MEPs also point out that microtargeting based on peopleâ€™s vulnerabilities is problematic, as is the spreading of hate speech and disinformation, asking for transparency on the monetisation policies of online platforms.</p>

	<div>
		<p>I’m sure everyone has heard the Mark Twain quote “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” But I think it should be reversed to “A correction can travel halfway around the world while the lie is putting on its shoes.” Both sides, but I think especially the left, bemoan that we are living in a ‘post-truth era,’ but is there any truth to this? The evidence would seem to suggest the opposite: that although public figures lie, their lies are debunked faster than ever thanks to fact-checking, much of which is decentralized and online. Decades ago, before social media and sites such as Twitter, it took days or even weeks to refute lies, and usually only the large or important lies (such as Watergate), but with so much fact-checking by either side hoping to score ‘wins’ against the opposing side, lies, half-truths, misconstructions, and omissions, are debunked and corrected in record time, no matter how small the stakes are. </p>
<p>The Twain quote made sense in an era when the transfer and control of information was centralized by major media companies (such as radio, TV, and print), but social media allows anyone to be a fact-checker. Astute readers can immediately find the logical inconsistences and errors of stories or of other comments, pointing out the errors in the comments, which are up-voted and promoted to the top of the comments section and easily visible. Given the popularity of Twitter and Reddit, there are enough subject-matter experts and smart people, no matter how esoteric the topic, that lies and falsehoods tend to be debunked quickly, and comments that debunk or offer clarification tend to get a lot of up-votes and are algorithmically pushed to the top and thus made visible, so everyone reading can see the correction without having to scroll much. </p>
<p>Whenever Trump or AOC tweets something, without fail,  fact-checkers from opposing sides pounce, but such fact-checking is not limited to just the opposing team. For example, when AOC demonstrated that she apparently does not understand how tax credits work in regard to her opposition of Amazon’s proposal to build a headquarters in New York City, it was Bill de Blasio, of all people, who fact-checked and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/de-blasio-ocasio-cortex-claim-spending-amazon-tax-break-money">corrected</a> her, within hours of her tweet. AOC was also corrected for not understanding the <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/05/24/its-just-the-weather-meteorologist-fact-checks-ocasio-cortez-on-climate-change/">difference</a> between weather and climate change, within minutes or her tweeting about it.  </p>
<p>Additionally, with the rise of real-time fact-checking, lies are debunked in mere minutes on sites such as Vox, New York Times, Snopes, or the Washington Post, instead of having to wait weeks for an editor to post a retraction or having to wait for the lie to be dunked days or weeks later. So as Trump is debating Biden, these sites will fact-check on a  minute-by-minute basis as the words are coming out of their mouths, which is unprecedented in the history of journalism or fact-checking.  </p>
<p>Just a dew days ago, the White House was forced to retract a statement that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Coney Barrett is a  “Rhodes Scholar”, when she actually only attended a place called Rhodes College. So that falsehood lasted less than a day, and although it is trivially easy to verify the source of the confusion, it shows how quickly falsehoods are debunked and corrected in the era of social media. </p>
<p>And in 2004, there was the infamous Killian documents controversy, in which documents purporting to show Bush’s misdeeds during his service in the Texas Air National Guard, were revealed to be a hoax, thanks to an independent investigation by fact-checkers who determined through typography analysis that the memo was not from 1972 as originally claimed, but instead produced on a desktop computer using modern-day word-processing program. The story of the memo possibly being fake went viral, forcing a retraction by CBS just a day later and the eventual resignation of Dan Rather.  </p>
<p>It is not just the news, but debunking and fact-checking also applies to organizations. The reason why Scientology (and other cults) thrived in the 20th century was not because people were more gullible, but because there was no cost-effective way to debunk such cults, and while Scientology is profitable, debunking it isn’t, so this means that pro-Scientology  messages will tend to prevail over anti-Scientology ones. But fast-forward to the 2000s and it costs next to nothing to put up a webpage debunking Scientology, whereas public service awareness ads are expensive and was the only option 50 years ago.  Now anyone can Google ‘Scientology’ and a bunch of negative stuff pops up. Unless the public service ads are run constantly, much like those anti-tobacco ads in the 2000s that were funded by litigation, the odd are pretty high that many people will not see the ads unless they tune in to the radio or TV constantly, but Google search results, unlike ads, are close to permanent and not ephemeral. </p>
<p>Even if lies are more prevalent now than they were in Twain’s era, I think the means and tools for debunking them are more powerful than ever, which means the likelihood that someone will get the ‘correct version’ of the story are much higher. For all the talk of ‘fake news’ and ‘alternative facts’ I would posit that the average person who follows the news, thanks to fact-checking and speedy corrections, is better-informed  than someone from generations ago in terms of having the correct version of a story. Politicians and other public figures will continue to lie, but the truth at least stands a much better chance of prevailing, even if, of course, there is no guarantee it will. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5b3f3e36341b2c34293034287634302f3a75383436">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-398c45a3fde378e52a9c"><div><p>Software is eating the world and APIs are at the forefront. Not only do APIs give developers instant access to powerful functionality, but their programmability also makes it easy for developers to integrate disparate pieces of functionality.</p><p>But today, this only applies to <em>documented</em> APIs. This means the company responsible for the API has made a conscious choice to expose the API—and they’ve allocated the resources to creating and maintaining documentation. This also means there are a <em>lot</em> of SaaS APIs out there that could make users’ lives easier, but that haven’t been documented.</p><p>This blog post is about a new feature that my team and I built after I spent a painful couple of days figuring out how to script against Notion. After my experience trying to learn the undocumented Notion API, we decided to automate the process of learning web APIs so that nobody would have to suffer like this again.</p><p>In this blog post, I talk about:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How I tried to automate against the Notion the hard way.</p></li><li><p>How this led my team at Akita to build a new feature to automatically learn undocumented APIs.</p></li><li><p>How to use Akita to <em>automatically</em> learn APIs, including the Notion API. (See what we learned on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>!)</p></li></ul><p>To anyone who wants to learn an undocumented API–or document your own API so people don’t have to do this—you may be interested in checking out <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">our private beta</a>!<br></p><h2>🐕 First, some background</h2><p>I’m Chris, the product manager at Akita. I joined Akita after eight years at Twilio, where I helped define products like Twilio Marketplace and Twilio Channels. While I was making APIs easier to use at Twilio, I also saw how APIs made software development harder. For instance, the rise of internal and external APIs make it much more difficult to prevent breaking changes. These observations led me to join Akita about a year ago.</p><p>At Akita, we’ve been working to give structure to the interaction graph of APIs, for instance to <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">detect breaking changes in web apps</a>. Akita watches API traffic to automatically generate API specs and infer implicit API contracts. Core to Akita’s approach is diffing API specs and contracts learned across different environments. We’ve been working hard to make this technology easily accessible to developers, no code changes required, in just minutes.</p><h2>💡 An observation about Notion&nbsp;</h2><p>Now for how I came to autogenerate an API spec for Notion.</p><p>As the product manager at a small startup, I spend a lot of time making sure that the right information gets to the right place. Customer feedback, blog posts like this one, product usage, and engineering metrics are just a few of the things I need to track. I also require some sleep, food, and the occasional trip outside. How do I manage to keep up? That’s easy: AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS!!!</p><p>When I joined Akita, I realized that Notion was what we needed to organize information across the team. But the problems started when we needed to add <em>new</em> information to Notion. For instance, we keep team meeting information in Notion. Most of our team meetings began with “Did someone create a Notion page?” or “Where is the page from last week’s meeting?” The same thing would happen during customer meetings.</p><p>Given how many meetings we have a week, I figured we could get several hours back <em>a week</em> if we could get computers to automate creating the Notion page for us. All we needed was to figure out how to automate Notion.<br></p><h2>😰 Thwarted by the Private API</h2><p>The catch? Notion doesn’t have a publicly documented API.</p><p>The good news is that it’s still possible to use an undocumented API. It’s easy. You could set up a headless browser to automate clicks or turn to that ol’ standby Grease Monkey script for watching your browser traffic. I recently read a blog post where the author ran a proxy and executed a man-in-the-middle attack in order to build a calendar widget for one of his favorite websites.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_27960"><div><p>Okay, it’s not easy. It took me a couple days of hacking to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">reasonable solution working</a> the first time. And the undocumented API problem is prevalent among newer SaaS tools, and it makes sense: APIs are hard to build, document, and maintain. If more of these tools had APIs, I would automate more and integrate them more deeply into our workflows.<br></p><h2>⚡️ Using Akita to learn the Notion API</h2><p>I wondered if there was a better way.</p><p>Then I realized: oh wait, I’m working on building a tool that <em>lets you generate API specifications by monitoring network traffic</em>. Surely we could use Akita to build API specs from watching my interactions with Notion?</p><p>But it wasn’t completely straightforward. Up to this point, we had set up Akita with the assumption that the user wants to document their <em>own</em> API, so Akita worked by listening to network traffic through an agent.</p><p>But when I posed this problem to my engineering team, they came up with a solution that let me generate this beautiful rendition of the Notion API spec.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_67186"><p>This feature was a game-changer! Now that Akita could learn this spec, I had an OpenAPI specification that detailed every endpoint, parameter, and property that the Notion frontend used. And what made this <em>really</em> useful was Akita’s analysis layered on top.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_72403"><div><p><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/29/taking-types-to-the-next-level-stop-api-bugs-by-inferring-data-formats?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">Akita Data Formats</a>, detecting precise data formats like unique IDs and specific datetime RFCs,&nbsp; and API Relationships, surfacing which endpoints accept values of the same data type, made it easier to understand how the endpoints worked together.</p><div><p>You can check out the API spec we were able to generate on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p></div><h2>🛠 How it works</h2><p>The secret to this new feature? HAR Files.</p><p>Previously, to run Akita you ran an agent alongside where you hosted a service. The agent would listen to network traffic and allow you to autogenerate API specs without having to make code changes or use a proxy. While this was super easy to use if you were learning your <em>own</em> API, it was less helpful for learning other people’s web APIs. Our new HAR file ingest allows you to learn <em>any web API</em> that relies on AJAX-style requests, <em>using any major web browser,</em> in a matter of minutes.</p><p>HAR Files are a little known feature of the Webkit Developer Console (available in major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) that allows you to record requests, performance metrics, and other interesting data from a debugging session. It turns out that it’s not so hard to extend Akita to accept HAR files instead of network traffic. HAR files are key to making it easy to autogenerate API specs, without needing headless servers or proxies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_160214"><p>Below I show a screen capture of me trying to break this new feature by returning to my old nemesis, Notion. In just minutes, I was able to automatically learn what had previously taken me days to uncover!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_122897"><div><p>All you need to do in order to generate a spec is:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Navigate to the website you want to learn an API for and start network log recording. (See instructions across different browsers <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204410413-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting">here</a>.)</p></li><li><p>Interact with the website to generate traffic.</p></li><li><p>Save your HAR file and use the Akita CLI to upload it to Akita.</p><pre><code>akita har ingest --service {SERVICE} {PATH_TO_HAR_FILE}</code></pre></li><li><p>You’re done! You’ll get a link for the generated API spec. 🎉</p></li></ol><p>Note that if you’re on the other side and want to learn a spec for your <em>own</em> API, the steps you follow are even simpler!</p><h2>🏝&nbsp; It’s your turn to live your best life</h2><p>Now that HAR file ingest is an official Akita feature, you, too, can wield this incredible power. With our new HAR File Ingest feature, you can now use Akita to learn the spec of any website you are using—and write time-saving automations like my script <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re interested in autogenerating API specs, sign up for our private beta <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.

			<p>I’ve always been curious about fractals, and the book I’m reading uses fractals in an example. I started playing with the example, and found it a good chance to see how much faster a powerful cloud computer can render a fractal than my modest laptop. In this post you’ll see what a fractal is, how to generate an image of a fractal, and how to animate a fractal. We’ll do all of this locally, and then when we’ve found something interesting to focus on we’ll move the rendering to a more powerful cloud computer.</p>
<p>This post will not get into highly-optimized cloud deployments such as clusters, but it will show you how to run medium-size jobs much faster than you can locally, for just a few dollars of cloud computing time. You will need a credit card to try this, as the free tiers on most cloud platforms are no more powerful than a modest laptop.</p>
<p>By the time you’re finished, you’ll be able to generate an animation like this:</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-fractal-image">Generating a fractal image</h2>
<p>Fractals can be visualized on the complex plane, which shows the real and imaginary components of complex numbers on separate axes. It might be helpful to have a quick overview of complex numbers.</p>
<h3 id="complex-numbers">Complex numbers</h3>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with complex numbers, they’re numbers made up of a real component and an imaginary component. A simple complex number would be written like this:</p>
<p>In this notation, <code>j</code> is the square root of -1. Mathematicians tend to use <em>i</em> to represent this value, while computer scientists tend to use <em>j</em> to avoid confusion with the convention of using <em>i</em> to represent an index in a loop. An arbitrary complex number is typically written as <code>a + bi</code>. We can do many operations with complex numbers such as adding and subtracting, multiplying, squaring, and more.</p>
<p>In Python, you can define a complex number in several ways. You can simply use the notation just shown:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>type</span>(c)
<span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>'</span><span>complex</span><span>'&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can also explicitly construct a complex number by passing the real and imaginary components to the <code>complex()</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>complex</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c
(<span>2</span><span>+</span><span>3j</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>When you have a complex number, you can extract its real and imaginary parts at any time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c<span>.</span>real
<span>2.0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c<span>.</span>imag
<span>3.0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have a complex number, you can do all of the common operations on them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c2 <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1.5</span> <span>+</span> <span>2.4j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>+</span> c2
(<span>0.5</span><span>+</span><span>5.4j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>-</span> c2
(<span>3.5</span><span>+</span><span>0.6000000000000001j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>*</span> c2
(<span>-</span><span>10.2</span><span>+</span><span>0.2999999999999998j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1<span>**</span><span>2</span>
(<span>-</span><span>5</span><span>+</span><span>12j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>abs</span>(c1)
<span>3.605551275463989</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Complex numbers can be plotted on a plane in much the same way we plot coordinate pairs on an xy plane. Instead of an x-axis and a y-axis, we have a real axis and an imaginary axis. The real axis is usually horizontal, like the x axis, and the imaginary axis is typically vertical.</p>
<p>Complex numbers, despite their use of the word “imaginary”, have many real-world applications. Complex numbers appear in the physics of electromagnetic phenomena, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="testing-points-in-a-fractal">Testing points in a fractal</h3>
<p>A fractal can be generated by asking a question at every point in a given region on the complex plane. Consider the point <code>p = 0.8 + 0.8j</code>, which is a little up and to the right of the origin. Consider another complex number, <code>c = -0.62772 - 0.42193j</code>. We want to repeatedly apply the following sequence of operations, and ask if the result ever exceeds a critical value:</p>
<ul>
<li>0th iteration: Square the complex number representing the point we’re considering, and add c to this number. This is the new complex number we’ll focus on.
<ul>
<li>Take the absolute value of the new complex number. Check if this has exceeded the critical value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1st iteration: Square the new complex number and add c again. This is the new complex number to focus on.
<ul>
<li>Take the absolute value of the new complex number; check if this has exceeded the critical value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat this operation until the result exceeds a critical value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at this sequence for the point <code>0.8 + 0.8j</code>, with a critical value of 2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Iteration</th>
<th>Input value</th>
<th>Input value squared plus c</th>
<th>Abs value of result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.8+0.8j</td>
<td>-0.628+0.858j</td>
<td>1.063</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>-0.628+0.858j</td>
<td>-0.97-1.499j</td>
<td>1.786</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>-0.97-1.499j</td>
<td>-1.934+2.486j</td>
<td>3.15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After the 0th iteration, the value we’re examining is 1.063, which is less than our critical value of 2.0. After iteration 1, the value is 1.786. After iteration 2, the value for this point is 3.15, which exceeds our critical value of 2.0.</p>
<p>Not all points are as simple as this. Consider the point <code>p = 0 + 0j</code>, which is the origin in the complex plane. Let’s look at the sequence for this point:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Iteration</th>
<th>Input value</th>
<th>Input value squared plus c</th>
<th>Abs value of result</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The final value for each iteration is bouncing around between 0 and 1. We have no way of knowing at this point if it will ever break out of this region. Let’s graph these values over a larger number of iterations. Here’s what that pattern looks like:</p>




<div>
    <p><img src="https://ehmatthes.com/blog/cloud_fractal/my_images/julia_boundedness_0-0.png"></p><p>The point 0 + 0j appears to bounce without leaving this region.</p>
</div>
<p>After 50 iterations, the result is still oscillating between 0 and 2. For any given point, we can’t tell whether the result will stay bounded as we complete more iterations; we can only state a number of iterations by which the point is still within the bounds we’ve set.</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-fractal-image-1">Generating a fractal image</h3>
<p>To generate a fractal image, we choose a region and conduct this set of calculations for every point in the region. We then assign each point in the region a color based on how many iterations it took for that point to exceed the critical value. We’ll first do this mathematically, by making a scatter plot. But then, to focus on the visualization, we’ll simply generate an image.</p>
<p>To get started, make a new directory for this project. Then create a virtual environment and install the two libraries we’ll need:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">$ mkdir exploring_fractals
$ cd exploring_fractals
$ python3 -m venv ef_env
$ source ef_env/bin/activate
(ef_env)$ pip install --upgrade pip
(ef_env)$ pip install numpy matplotlib
(ef_env)$ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre></div><p>We’re going to need NumPy to make a range of floats, and we’ll plot the fractal using Matplotlib. We’ll use the requirements.txt file to create an identical project environment on the remote server.</p>
<p>Here’s the first part of our code, which I’m saving as julia_set_plot.py:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>"""Generate an image of the julia set."""</span>

<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> pyplot <span>as</span> plt


<span># Bounds and critical values</span>
a_bound, b_bound <span>=</span> <span>1.8</span>, <span>1.8</span>
c <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>0.62772</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.42193j</span>
max_iterations <span>=</span> <span>20</span>
escape_bound <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
num_steps <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The values <code>a_bound</code> and <code>b_bound</code> specify the region of the complex plane that we’ll focus on. We’ll focus on the region bounded by <code>a_bound + b_bound*j</code>, <code>a_bound - b_bound*j</code>, <code>-a_bound - b_bound*j</code>, and <code>-a_bound + b_bound*j</code>. We need to specify how many iterations to try on each point; we’ll set this value at 20 right now to make sure our program runs reasonably quickly. The value <code>num_steps</code> specifies how many points to test betweeen <code>-a_bound</code> and <code>a_bound</code>, and <code>-b_bound</code> and <code>b_bound</code>. A value of 200 steps will give us a scatter plot with 200 * 200 points. We’ll increase this value once we know things are working.</p>
<p>Now we need a function to determine the number of iterations it takes to exceed the critical value for any given point, up to <code>max_iterations</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
num_steps <span>=</span> <span>200</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_iterations</span>(point):
    <span>"""How many iterations does it take to exceed the critical value?"""</span>
    iteration <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    pv <span>=</span> point<span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>+</span> c
    <span>while</span> iteration <span>&lt;</span> max_iterations:
        <span>if</span> <span>abs</span>(pv) <span>&gt;</span> escape_bound:
            <span>return</span> iteration
        <span>else</span>:
            pv <span>=</span> pv<span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>+</span> c
            iteration <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> iteration
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>get_iterations()</code> takes in a complex point. It keeps track of the number of iterations, starting at 0. We square the point and add c, and call this <code>pv</code> for <em>point value</em>. While the iteration number is less than <code>max_iterations</code>, we check if the absolute value of the point value is less than the critical escape bound that we’ve previously set. If it is, we return the number of iterations. If the point value hasn’t exceeded the critical value yet, we prepare for another iteration by setting the new point value equal to the previous value squared plus c, and increment the number of iterations. Finally, we return the iteration number if we exit the loop without having exceeded the critical value.</p>
<p>Now we need a function that will loop over all the points in the region, and return these points along with the number of iterations for each point. Here’s the function, which we’ll call <code>get_julia_points()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_iterations</span>(point):
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_julia_points</span>():
    <span>"""Define the points, and the number of iterations for each point."""</span>
    points, …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Curating your <a href="https://querystash.com/">QueryStash</a> with Tags and extra metadata allows us to
make <a href="https://querystash.com/blog/search-your-stash">Search</a> really easy, to help you retrieve the query you need,
when you need it. However sometimes it makes more sense to physically curate related queries
together in one place. Just as you would with your files in a folder or music in a playlist,
specifically indicating that these things belong in the same place.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_item.png">
</p>

<h2 id="introducing-collections">Introducing Collections</h2>

<p>Collections are specifically designed to help group content together. Everything from related
snippets like math formulas, to extensive analysis projects that involve many queries to generate
the results.</p>

<p>For now think of them exactly like you would folders, if it belongs together stash it in the
same place. The additional benefit is a query can belong to many collections, so if it makes
sense why not add it to multiple collections.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-collection">Create a Collection</h2>

<p>To get started navigate to the <a href="https://app.querystash.com/collections">Collections</a> page. 
Here you will find your blank canvas to start your collections journey.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_start.png">
</p>

<p>Go ahead and click that big blue button above to create your first Collection. Alternatively
click the “New Collection” button on the right hand side. Hopefully this will be very familiar
territory for yourself as this is exactly the same as the new Query process.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/create_collection.png">
</p>

<p>Once you land at the New Collection page, you have a very short form to complete with some
essential information.</p>

<p>Complete the form with a Collection title and a brief description to encapsulate the purpose
of the collection. Don’t worry too much you can add to the description and change the title at
any point.</p>

<p>Hit save and your new Collection is ready to start adding to.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/add_to_collection.png">
</p>

<p>When you view your Stash or an individual query, you will notice a new folder icon has been
added to the query menu, click the button and view the list of Collections you have created.
Select any Collection to add the query.</p>

<p>Omce you have added a few queries head back to the Collections page and view your new curated 
Collection. Still haven’t created your first query? <a href="https://querystash.com/blog/your-first-query.html">View our guide.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_view.png">
</p>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-collections">What’s Next for Collections?</h2>

<p>Organising is really just the start of Collections, the end goal is really to enable the ability
to not only organise but tell stories. Imagine the full analysis project from SQL code, to output 
results tables, to interactive visualisations, all connected through commentary text.</p>

<p>We are just at the beginning of the journey. Follow our <a href="https://querystash.com/roadmap">product roadmap</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
  
  <time datetime="2020-07-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Jul 2020</time>
  <p>I heard a lot lately about using types in Haskell to describe function arguments in more details
(e.g. function takes a list that is non-empty) and thus achieve higher compile-time safety.
It sounded cool so I decided to research more about it and I created this blog post as a memo of
what I learned.</p>

<p>Resources I used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200212212525/https://andre.tips/wmh/generalized-algebraic-data-types-and-data-kinds/">Tutorial on GADTs and DataKinds by andre.tips</a>
    <ul>
      <li>explains GADTs well, but DataKinds not so much. I would recommend to start with this one.
  [The page seems to be down, so I linked to the Wayback Machine url.]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/04/26/basic_type_level_programming_in_haskell.html">Basic Type Level Programming in Haskell by Matt Parsons</a>
    <ul>
      <li>pretty extensive, but not so intuitive. Still the most complete intro (and pretty much
the only one) to the topic. Most of my examples below are taken from it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-type-level-programming">Why type-level programming?</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, my current understanding is that with it we can add more info into the type
signature of a function, making it “safer” in the compile time.
E.g. instead of just saying <em>“this function takes a list”</em>
we can say <em>“this function takes a non-empty list”</em>, or
<em>“this function takes Int which is &gt; 10 and &lt; 127”</em> (although this last one might be solved just by
creating an appropriate type, e.g. using TH?).</p>

<p>TODO: I would love to learn about more examples where this is used.</p>

<h2 id="example-a-function-that-accepts-only-a-non-empty-list">Example: A function that accepts only a non-empty list</h2>

<p>We want to be able to tell from its type whether a list is empty or not. To do that we will
create a new type which will have that information stored in it.</p>

<p>First, let’s see how we would create a “normal” list type on our own:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is a usual recursive definition of list (<code>Cons</code> stands for <em>Constructor</em>). Once there is
an instance of this type we can tell which type of elements the list contains (e.g. <code>List Int</code>
or <code>List (Maybe String)</code>), but nothing more than that. We cannot deduce from its type (which means
in compile time) whether it is empty or not.</p>

<p>We could of course check it in runtime and throw an exception if the list is empty, but we want to
be stricter than that. We want to ensure that program cannot even be compiled if an empty list is
provided where it shouldn’t be.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-we-missing">What are we missing?</h3>

<p>The problem with the “normal” list we defined above is that we are missing information in its type.
We have only one piece of
information and that is type of the elements within the list - we use type parameter <code>a</code> to declare
that. We can also use it to define functions that work only for a specific <code>a</code>. E.g. here is a
function that works only on a list of integers:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>sumListElements</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is guaranteed in compile-time. If we call this function with a list of e.g. <code>Bool</code>s, the
compiler will throw an error at us.</p>



<p>So here’s an idea - why don’t we just use the same mechanism again (having a type parameter) to
know whether a list is empty or not. If we added another type parameter to keep track of that,
our type (disregarding data constructors for now) would look like this:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Just as type param <code>a</code> means <em>any type</em> (e.g. <code>Int</code> or <code>MyType</code>), the same applies for <code>empty</code>.
E.g. we could have <code>List Int Double</code> or <code>List String Bool</code> or <code>List Int SomeCustomType</code>.
Just as we restricted function <code>sumListElements</code> above to work only when <code>a</code> is <code>Int</code>, we can use
<code>empty</code> in the same way.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to implement a safe version of <code>head</code> function - that means it accepts only a
non-empty list as an argument, otherwise it won’t compile. We will call it <code>safeHead</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, we introduced <code>empty</code> as another type parameter, but the question we are facing now is what
do we do with it? Which concrete types will take its place and how?</p>

<p>Lets introduce two new types:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing here is that we have only type constructors for these types and no data
constructors. That means we cannot create instances (values) of these types, but that is ok!
We need these types only at the type level, in function signatures. Such types are also called
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Empty_type"><em>uninhabited</em> or <em>empty</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s imagine we have a way to correctly assign <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> to empty and non-empty
lists’ types. Then we could define <code>safeHead</code> as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>safeHead</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>safeHead</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>elem</span> <span>_</span> <span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>elem</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We wouldn’t even have to define a case for <code>End</code> since the type guarantees it can’t ever happen.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-correct-type-to-empty">Assigning correct type to <code>empty</code></h3>

<p>The main question that is left is how do we produce such lists with an extra type parameter, and
how do we make sure which type <code>empty</code> takes when? This is what we will look at now.</p>

<p>This is how our type <code>List</code> looks once we have added <code>empty</code> as a second type parameter:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Except adding that extra type parameter, nothing else changed. When I first saw this,
I was confused by
the fact there is a type parameter on the left side that doesn’t appear anywhere on the right side
as a data.
How is that possible, why would that make sense? (Ok, <em>there is</em> <code>empty</code> on the right side here, but
only as a part of a type designation and not as a part of data constructor. Which means there will
never be anything of type <code>empty</code> in some value of this type).</p>

<p>But turns out it does make sense, since we use it as a designation at the type level only, to show
that an
underlying value has a certain property (empty or non-empty in this case). Such types, which have a
type parameter(s) on the left side that don’t appear on the right are
also called <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type"><em>phantom types</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see now what happens if we create an instance of our new <code>List</code> and test its type in GHCi:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>emptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>emptyList</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>"haskell"</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span>
<span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we can see, GHCi concluded that <code>a</code> is a string in <code>nonEmptyList</code>, but could not deduce anything
for <code>empty</code> in either case, since it is not used anywhere. So how can we solve that
and make sure that <code>empty</code> becomes <code>Empty</code> for <code>emptyList</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> for <code>nonEmptyList</code>?</p>

<h3 id="gadts">GADTs</h3>

<p>Before we continue, let’s check types of our data constructors, <code>End</code> and <code>Cons</code> (since they are
functions as well, we can do that):</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>Cons</span>
<span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see they have no power to change or specify <code>empty</code> type param in any way. <code>End</code> will leave
it unspecified, while <code>Cons</code> will preserve it from the input list. Also, we have no way to change
these type signatures as they are automatically derived from <code>List</code> type definition.</p>

<p>This is exactly where GADTs come in. GADTs (<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">Generalized Algebraic Data Types</a>) is a Haskell extension that lets us explicitly
define the type signatures of data constructors.</p>

<p>Before seeing GADTs in action, let’s first remind ourselves of the standard,
non-GADT definition of <code>List</code> we used above:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Now let’s rearrange it a bit and add types of data constructors in comments so we can more easily
reason about them:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>|</span>                   <span>-- End :: List a empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>   <span>-- Cons :: a -&gt; List a empty -&gt; List a empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we mentioned, the types in the comments are automatically derived and we cannot control them. But
that is exactly what we want to do, and GADTs let us achieve that using the following syntax:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see it is very similar to our “rearranged” <code>List</code> definition above! What GADTs let us do
is write by ourselves types of data constructors (which were in the previous definition in the
comments), giving us control to specify them as we wish!</p>

<p>The difference in the syntax is that we have to add <code>where</code> after the type name and then
for each data constructor we specify its type signature.</p>

<p>Now we finally have the power to control <code>empty</code> type parameter (in <code>List a empty</code>)! We specified
that <code>End</code> will mark list as <code>Empty</code>, while <code>Cons</code> will mark it as <code>NonEmpty</code>. And this is exactly
what we wanted to do, because if we used <code>End</code> we know the list is empty, while if we used <code>Cons</code>
we know there is at least one element in it, which makes it non-empty.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action! Using it stays the same as without GADTs, just that this time there will
be <code>empty</code> type param which assumes an appropriate type:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span><span>)</span>
<span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>Num</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Wohoo, this works now! We see we can construct values of this type and we will always know whether
it is empty or not. <code>safeHead</code> function we defined above will work on these without any problems.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-just-use-smart-constructors-instead-of-gadts">Can we just use smart constructors instead of GADTs?</h3>

<p>One possible “downside” of GADTs is that it is a language extension we have to enable, thus making
our codebase a bit heavier (longer compilation time?) and less “standard”.</p>

<p>Sometimes we can avoid using GADTs with smart constructors. Let’s see what that is and how it would
work in this case.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Smart_constructors">Smart constructor</a> is simply a function that is used
to create a certain value instead of using its
data constructor directly. We typically do that (hide data constructors and expose smart
constructor functions) when we want to have extra control over the value creation. E.g. we want to
make some extra checks, or make sure an invalid value isn’t provided etc.</p>

<p>For example, we could provide a following smart constructor to create an empty list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>And this works! By defining the type signature of <code>createEmptyList</code> we made sure that <code>empty</code> will
always assume the type of <code>Empty</code> when this function is called. Since <code>End</code> has a type signature
<code>End :: List a empty</code>, we just “casted” type param <code>empty</code> here into a specific type.</p>

<p>Let’s try to do the same for the other data constructor, adding an element to the list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>addElemToList</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
<span>add…</span></code></pre></figure></article></div></div>

The government issued advice and guidance in place of rules and restrictions. School and work went ahead. Many businesses stayed open.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But as of Monday,&nbsp;Sweden's per capita death rate from COVID-19 was the 15th highest in the world, or 13th if you exclude the tiny countries of Andorra and San Marino,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5800901/coronavirus-map/">according to data from Time magazine and Johns Hopkins University</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Now Sweden&nbsp;is shifting its policy. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/17/sweden-considers-local-lockdowns-shift-coronavirus-strategy/">According to the Telegraph</a>,&nbsp;starting Monday, the government has empowered regional health authorities — in consultation with the federal public health agency —&nbsp;to instruct citizens&nbsp;to stay away from crowded spaces like shopping malls, museum, gyms, and concerts, and avoid taking public transport or visiting the elderly. However, there will be no&nbsp;legal or financial consequences for non-compliance.</p>  <p>Einhorn,&nbsp;a virologist, author and filmmaker in Sweden,&nbsp;is one dozens of medical experts who have been critical of the country's COVID-19 response from the start.

They assumed that this would be like SARS; it would never sort of be a major problem in Sweden or outside of Southeast Asia. They were convinced it's only spread from symptomatic people, so like SARS, you could isolate the symptomatic people and stop the spread that way.</p>  <p>That was fair, you know, sometime in January. It was not fair in April or in May. So they stuck to that. And one could say that when the spread really …&nbsp;hit Europe and Sweden, they did the opposite of our Scandinavian and Nordic neighbours who went into lockdown, and we did not.</p>  <p><strong>There was an idea that we heard from coming from Sweden in the spring, and I guess it continued, that Sweden would attempt something called "herd immunity," that if enough people were to contract the virus, that eventually there would be a general immunity enough within the population that it would have a better effect than locking things down and keeping people from getting it. Is that what happened?</strong></p>  <p>It has been assumed that they were going for herd immunity, but they've been speaking through two sides of their mouths. On the one hand, they've been denying it. On the others, on the other hand, they said it would be a bonus.</p>  <p>They said that come fall, and the second wave, we will be much better protected than our Scandinavian neighbours who had 10 times less deaths than we did in relation to population. But it became very clear once broad testing of antibodies was being done that there was nothing close to herd immunity.</p>  <p>And so, of course, they realize that they can't go for herd immunity. It's going to kill too many people. I mean, it's already killed almost 6,000 people in a population of 10 million. So they are no longer going for herd immunity, which doesn't mean that they're prepared to say, "we were wrong and we're going to change our recommendations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden attends a news conference updating the country about COVID-19 on Oct. 9.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>At the centre of all of this, as we have followed what's going on in Sweden, is a man named </strong><strong>Anders&nbsp;Tegnel, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, and he seems to be a bit of a rock star in your country for the decisions he made. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tegnell-tattoo-idUSKCN2292G7">People have tattoos of him on their bodies.</a> So why is he so popular?</strong></p>  <p>This is a combination of factors, and this deserves a long discussion. Part of it, I'm sure, is that when there's a national crisis, people want to believe in authority.</p>  <p>The other aspect is that he has a very calming demeanour. Even when the numbers were going through the roof, he kept saying that we're flattening out, we're hitting the peak. He had a way of sounding extremely calming.</p>  <p>And also, you know, 90 per cent of the deaths were in the elderly, so …&nbsp;most people didn't see it.</p>  <p><strong>And what do you think of&nbsp;Anders&nbsp;Tegnel?</strong></p>  <p>I have no opinions about him personally, but I think he has not handled this well and he keeps on not handling this well.</p>  <p>Just as an example, Sweden is [one of the only countries],&nbsp;together with Somalia, Yemen, Eritrea, Syria, Greenland and some Pacific islands, who have still no recommendations for face masks whatsoever. So, you know, he hates face masks. He says they don't help. He keeps saying there's no support for them.</p>  <p>In the spring, that could have been a fair assumption. But by now, there's the studies are overwhelmingly showing the benefit of face masks, especially when it's used in the whole population, because it protects against someone who is sick.</p>  <p>So if everybody wears it, face masks are extremely efficient. But if only 50 per cent wear it, it's not at all sufficient. But he will not even say that they're good. I mean, you have to understand, in the Swedish hospitals, the doctors and nurses do not wear face masks.</p>    <p><strong>Well, it seems that [U.S. President] Donald Trump and the people around him would agree with Anders&nbsp;Tegnel.&nbsp;But the rest of the world, at least in countries where they have policies, they are not doing that. So somebody is right and somebody is wrong.</strong></p>  <p>The interesting thing is that in Sweden, we have a social democratic government dominated by the Social Democrats, so …&nbsp;it's more of a left-wing policy. Whereas in the rest of the world, it's very much a right-wing <em>laissez faire</em> policy to have herd immunity, or to try to have herd immunity, or to not wear face masks. Freedom, you know?</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>A sign promoting physical distancing is pictured in the Gallerian in Stockholm, Sweden, May 12.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>There was <a href="https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/">a freedom of information [request</a>, and] a bunch of emails that have been published by journalists in your country that show that Mr. Tegnel said that at one point that when it was suggested that 10 per cent of those who would get the disease would be the elderly and maybe they would die, 10 per cent might be "worth it," he apparently said.

So it hasn't benefited from it, and it has certainly not benefited from the herd immunity.</p>  <p><strong>Today we saw the announcement that citizens in Sweden should avoid places like shopping malls, museums, gyms, concerts, and avoid public transportation or visiting the elderly. So is there a shift perhaps in perception?</strong></p>  <p>There are policies. You know, it's not a completely<em> laissez faire</em>. I mean, people are advised to stay to work from home if they can. People are advised to not fill up the public transportation, the busses and the subways. There is still a maximum amount of people gathering of 50.</p>  <p>It's not a complete "let's live as normal" — but it's all recommendations and advice.</p>  <p>I would say that incrementally, Sweden has has gotten closer to other countries. I mean, we do a lot of testing now. We do, you know, about as much as Canada per capita. So it's not like in the spring, where nobody was tested outside of the hospital.</p>  <p>But it still is always too little.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

<![CDATA[Retool Funding Lesson: You Can Compete with Free When It's B2B]]>

	<p>Retool has announced that it raised $50M from Sequoia only 2 years after launch for what is essentially a front-end builder. While explaining to a non-developer friend how you can build a business selling something that countless web developers can cobble together out of free open source components, I accidentally busted this rhyme:</p>

<p>You can compete with free,
when it comes to B2B,
because for businesses
no-charge isn’t free</p>

<p>Look at it from a business’s point of view. Let’s say they pay a web developer $100 / hour. If it takes that dev 10 hours to piece together a front end from React, Bootstrap, and several tends of thousands of Javascript packages, that app cost them $1000. The fact that they don’t pay for the open source components is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Now imagine they could get the same app with 2 hours of effort using a tool that costs $100 / month. That $100 tool ends up costing them $-700. Paying up starts to sound like a pretty good deal</p>

<p>There are lots of examples of this economic story playing out if you look for them. Any development team can replicate the essential elements of Algolia with Apache Solr or Elasticsearch, but Algolia is going strong. Open source CMS options abound, but Contentful raised an $80M series E recently.</p>

<p>The big caveat here is that this <em>does not</em> apply in the B2C world. Consumers are famously blind to total cost of ownership, both monetary and intangible (like giving up any semblance of privacy for a ‘free’ navigation app). Free really is nigh on impossible to beat when you are targeting consumers. And the false economy of cheap-but-fragile junk is so compelling that finding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife">things that won’t break in a couple of years is an armchair sport</a>.</p>

<p>Next time your trying to think of a business idea, ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are businesses dependent on that they aren’t paying for directly but they are paying dearly for in employee hours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever answer you come up with, it’s a million dollar idea.</p>

                    <p>This is going to be a short one.</p><p>I love Salesforce. It's a peerless tool based on functionality provided, opportunities for customization, and dynamic developer community. However, the online Salesforce store - i.e. the way people actually purchase Salesforce for use - sucks. Yes, the <em>Sales</em>force storefront sucks.</p><p>Imagine this user journey. I'm a Salesforce enterprise user and want to upgrade my subscription to include the Partner Community license add-on. Seems pretty common/simple, right? Well, you be the judge.</p><h2 id="getting-the-quote">Getting the Quote</h2><p>For a digital product, the de facto expectation these days is a self-service checkout. Not so with Salesforce. God forbid you want to extend the functionality of your CRM with native extensions, have fun navigating case support and the multi-day dialogue required to secure a quote. Just take my money!</p><h2 id="checkout">Checkout</h2><p>So you've jumped through the hoops and gotten your quote, what happens now?

			<p>The use of fiat currency in our modern society is so accepted that many people will go through their whole life without questioning why the dollar in their pocket has value, or for that matter, why it exists at all.</p>
<p>In this article,&nbsp;we shall seek to answer two basic questions. First, why does paper money exist? Second, why do we readily accept paper money in exchange for our goods and services?</p>
<p>Mainstream economics tends to answer both of these questions by referring to the role of money as a “medium of exchange”. In general terms, economists might argue that paper money exists because it forms a valuable role as a medium of exchange (barter economies are inefficient) and paper money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>While it is true that “money is a medium of exchange”, this is the wrong answer to both of the questions posited above.</p>
<p>The view of The Money Enigma&nbsp;is that fiat money exists because it is a useful financing tool for society. When governments don’t wish to pay their bills by raising more taxes or by issuing more debt, they can simply create money.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason we accept fiat money in exchange for our goods and services is because, as a society, we recognize that money is a financial instrument. More specifically, fiat money represents a proportional claim on the output of our society. This is the way in which fiat money derives its value and this is the reason that fiat money can perform its functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.</p>
<p>In simple terms, <em>money is the equity of society</em>. Fiat money exists because it is a useful as a financing tool and it has value because it is a financial instrument (it is a special-form equity instrument of society).</p>
<p>The fact that fiat money is a “medium of exchange” is incidental to its nature. More specifically, fiat money does not derive value from its nature as a medium of exchange. Rather, money can only perform its role as a medium of exchange because it possesses the property of market value, a property that is derived solely from its nature as a financial instrument.</p>
<p>Those that claim that money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange are engaging in a circular argument. Why does money have value? It has value because it is widely accepted in exchange. Why is money widely accepted in exchange? It is accepted because it has value.</p>
<p>The problems created by this circular argument are largely ignored by most economists, despite the fact that this circular argument lies at the heart of Keynes’ liquidity preference theory. We will discuss the flaws in liquidity preference theory another time. For now, let’s take some time to explore the two simple questions we started with.</p>
<p><strong>Why does fiat money exist?</strong></p>
<p>The view implied by many textbooks is that fiat money exists because it is a useful medium of exchange. But was creating a medium of exchange the motivation of those who first issued fiat money?</p>
<p>Let’s put that question another way. Do you think that the first kings that issued fiat money did so because they felt that their society needed another “medium of exchange”? Was fiat money just part of a benevolent desire by those rulers to assist commerce? Were these rulers visionaries who saw the long-term benefits to trade of paper money?</p>
<p>The short answer to all three questions is “no”.</p>
<p>Paper money was introduced to pay the bills when the kings ran out of gold.</p>
<p>The kings in our early societies didn’t create paper money because they were worried that gold wasn’t fulfilling its role as an efficient “medium of exchange”. Gold and silver were doing just fine as a medium of exchange. Rather, the issuance of paper money was an act of survival: it offered a mechanism to pay the army when the kingdom was close to running out of gold.</p>
<p>However, there was a trick to this arrangement. In order for this new paper money to be accepted, the king had to convince the people that the money was “as good as gold”. More specifically, the money had to be issued with the explicit agreement that it could be exchanged for a fix amount of gold on request (for example, one ounce per dollar). If people believed that this promise was credible, then the paper money would trade at the same value as its gold equivalent. However, if this promise lacked credibility, then the value of the paper money would soon collapse.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in most cases, this system worked, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Fiat money was issued because it performed a unique role as a financing tool. If the kingdom couldn’t raise taxes and was reaching the limits of its borrowings, then issuing paper money that was backed by gold was an attractive way of financing public expenses.</p>
<p>The point is that fiat money is a financing tool. Originally, fiat money was issued as a financial instrument that promised the bearer a certain amount of gold or silver. This is why fiat money was accepted and why it was considered by all to possess the property of “market value”.</p>
<p>Over time, most modern societies have abandoned the gold standard. Most fiat money is no longer convertible into gold at request. But this hasn’t changed the reason money is issued. Money is a financing tool that. Money is still issued to pay for public activities that we, as a society, don’t wish to pay for with taxes or with the issuance of government debt.</p>
<p>Once you strip away all the technical language, the activities of our modern central banks are simple. When governments wish to manipulate financial markets (most notably, suppressing the interest rate by purchasing government debt), they have three basic choices to fund their debt purchases: raise taxes, issue debt or print money. Issuing debt and using the proceeds to buy back that debt defeats the purpose of the exercise. Raising taxes to buy government debt is not a popular move and is likely to be counterproductive, particularly when the economy is weak. Therefore, the government, through its monetary policy agency (the central bank), issues money to buy its debt. This action lowers the interest rate and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Once again, nothing has changed. Fiat money is issued to pay for things (buying debt) that the government doesn’t wish to pay for by raising taxes or issuing debt. Fiat money exists because it is a financing tool “par excellence”.</p>
<p>What has changed over time is the way in which fiat money derives its value and this brings us to our second question.</p>
<p><strong>Why does fiat money have value?</strong></p>
<p>If we go back to our earlier example, the reason that fiat money had value in the days of the gold standard is obvious: money was backed by gold.</p>
<p>Gold is a real asset, which is to say that it derives its value from its <em>physical properties</em>.</p>
<p>Fiat money is not a real asset. Rather, fiat money is a financial instrument, which is to say that it derives its value from its <em>contractual properties</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Real assets versus financial instruments" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=624%2C468 624w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?w=720 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Paper money has no value in and of itself. However, paper money does represent something. In the case of early fiat money, paper money represented an explicit claim to a certain amount of gold or silver. The holder of paper money was a party to a contract that stated that the holder could exchange that piece of paper for something of more tangible value.</p>
<p>The mystery of paper money is why it continued to possess any value once the explicit gold convertibility feature was dropped. Why did paper money continue to have any worth once the explicit contract was rendered null and void?</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom is that money continued to have value because, by that time, it was accepted as a medium of exchange. The problem is that this creates the circular argument that we alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>Money is only accepted as a medium of exchange because it possesses the property of “market value”. If money did not have any value, then it would not function as a medium of exchange (if money had no value, you wouldn’t accept money from me in exchange for your goods/services).</p>
<p>If that basic fact is established, then we can’t also argue that money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange. Either money is a medium of exchange because it has value, or it has value because it is a medium of exchange. It can’t be both.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need is something to break this circular argument. More specifically, we need a better model for explaining why fiat money possesses the property of “market value” when the explicit gold backing is removed.</p>
<p>As discussed, fiat money is not a real asset: it doesn’t derive value from its physical properties. Therefore, fiat money must be a financial instrument: it must derive its value from some sort of contractual arrangement.</p>
<p>The solution is to imagine that when the gold-convertibility feature was dropped, the explicit contract that governed fiat money was replaced by an implied-in-fact contract. In other words, when the gold-convertibility feature was removed, paper money no longer represented an explicit claim to something of value. But, it did still represent an implied claim to something of value: the output of society.</p>
<p>The view developed by The Enigma Series is that money is the equity of society. More specifically, money is a long-duration, proportional claim on the output of society. Money is an economic liability of society, even though it remains a legal liability of government and is issued by government on society’s behalf (society can not issue claims directly because “society” is not a legal entity).</p>
<p>The explicit contract that governed fiat money (gold-convertibility) was replaced by an implied-in-fact contract. This new contract, which is in essence an agreement between every member of society, states that money is a proportional claim on the output of society.</p>
<p>This is a complicated idea, but we can think of it in simple terms.</p>
<p>In essence, money is a much like a share of common stock. A business can issue common stock and each share becomes a proportional claim on the future cash flow of that business. All else remaining equal, …</p></div></div>

October 20, 2020 | https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>In this post, we will take a legacy application and improve its search
functionality. We will do this with only a few changes to the
application itself. Using a technique called change data capture (CDC)
we will listen for changes in a database and react to these
changes&nbsp;- write to a search index case. Before writing to the
search index, we will also enrich the data with a natural language
processing (NLP) step that extracts keywords from a text description.</p>
<p>We might want to use an external search index for various reasons,
especially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to provide more feature-rich functionality than full-text search in a
relational database;</p></li>
<li><p>to scale the search independently of the database;</p></li>
<li><p>to add more functionality (keyword extraction) to the application
without
modifying it - making changes to a legacy application is sometimes
risky, or time-consuming, so taking this approach might be faster,
therefore cheaper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Hazelcast Jet - an open-source stream processing system - and its CDC
module to read changes made to the application database for further
processing in a Jet pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Jet pipeline, we will enrich the data with an NLP mapping step.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the results to an Elasticsearch index, using an Elasticsearch
connector, <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/14/jet-42-is-released">released in Jet 4.2</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-architecture.png" alt="Architecture"></p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring
PetClinic</a>
application. It is relatively well-known to many Java developers and is
rather similar to a typical enterprise application.</p>
<p>The application provides a management tool for managing pets, their
owners, and visits to vets. It allows searching for owners, but only
using the owner’s last name. We will make the search more feature-rich,
allowing us to search on first name, last name, pet names and keywords
extracted from descriptions of the visits.</p>
<p>First, let’s start a vanilla version of the application. Run the
following command to start MySQL database inside a Docker container, we
use the official MySQL image, which allows us to create a database for
the pet clinic application easily:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-mysql -it \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 mysql
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the pet clinic application source code from
<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic">Github</a> (this is a
fork of the official <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring PetClinic
repository</a> with a
branch containing the changes we will make later for your convenience).</p>
<pre><code>git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic.git
</code></pre>
<p>Start the pet clinic application from the command line by running the
following command:</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> spring-petclinic
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
</code></pre>
<p>And wait for the following log message:</p>
<pre><code>2020-09-30 16:17:04.113  INFO 24847 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.s.petclinic.PetClinicApplication     : Started PetClinicApplication in 3.177 seconds (JVM running for 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owners in top-level menu</p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owner button to list all data</p>
<p>and you should see a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-spring-petclinic-list.png" alt="Spring PetClinic Sample Application"></p>
<h2>Prepare for Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>In order to stream the changes from the MySQL database we need to modify
certain settings and grant more permissions to the <code>petclinic</code> user.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start MySQL client, enter the <code>mysql</code>
password for the root user:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm --link petclinic-mysql:petclinic-mysql mysql mysql -hpetclinic-mysql -uroot -p
</code></pre>
<p>Run the following to grant privileges to the <code>petclinic</code> user to allow
listening to the database changes:</p>
<pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>USER</span> petclinic <span>IDENTIFIED</span> <span>WITH</span> mysql_native_password <span>BY</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> RELOAD <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>CLIENT</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>SLAVE</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ALTER USER</code> command changes the default authentication method to
one supported by the Jet CDC connector. The <code>GRANT</code> commands allow the
petclinic user to stream changes from the database in the same way as
during master-slave replication.</p>
<h2>Start Elasticsearch</h2>
<p>We want to enable full-text search across multiple fields, but not all
fields. With Elasticseach we need to create an index mapping that
copies fields into a single field, the field is then used for searching.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start Elasticsearch inside a docker
container:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-elastic \
  -e discovery.type=single-node \
  -e cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled=<span>false</span> \
  -p9200:9200 elasticsearch:7.9.2
</code></pre>
<p>Create an Elasticsearch index mapping by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -XPUT -H <span>"Content-type: application/json"</span> -d <span>'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.visits.keywords": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "search": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}'</span> http://localhost:9200/petclinic-index
</code></pre>
<p>The default setting of Elasticsearch analyzer is suitable for us. For
more elaborate configuration of the text analysis, you should look into
the Elasticsearch documentation or some other source.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet Job</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Petclinic and Elastic set-up and working, we can
start the data pump - a Jet job reading change events from MySQL
database and writing into the Elastic index.</p>
<p>A Jet job is a pipeline of steps that read, modify, aggregate or store
data items. The job definition is written in Java and packaged as a jar
file. The jar file is deployed to a Jet cluster, which takes care of the
execution, scaling, fail-over and other operational aspects.</p>
<p>The job consists of 4 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CDC Source connecting to MySQL database</p></li>
<li><p>A mapping step running the keyword extraction</p></li>
<li><p>A joining step reconstructing the document from change records from</p></li>
<li><p>different tables</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticsearch sink</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>CDC Source</h3>
<p>The configuration of the source is straightforward, just set the required
parameters:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>MySqlCdcSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>mysql</span><span>(</span><span>"mysql"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseAddress</span><span>(</span>databaseAddress<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePort</span><span>(</span>databasePort<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseUser</span><span>(</span>databaseUser<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePassword</span><span>(</span>databasePassword<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setClusterName</span><span>(</span>clusterName<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setTableWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic.owners"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.pets"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.visits"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use the source to read change events from MySQL into the pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>Pipeline</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Pipeline</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>StreamStage</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> allRecords <span>=</span> p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
                                        <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Keyword extraction</h3>
<p>The next step in the pipeline is to extract the keywords from the visit
description. We will use Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm, the implementation we use was originally published on
<a href="https://github.com/Linguistic/rake">Github</a>. The implementation is not
important for the demonstration, you could use any other Java library,
call a 3rd party service, e.g. via <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/how-tos/grpc">grpc</a> or use our
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/python">python integration</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>ServiceFactory</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>,</span> <span>Rake</span><span>&gt;</span></span> keywordService <span>=</span> <span>ServiceFactories</span><span>.</span><span>sharedService</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>context<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Rake</span><span>(</span><span>"en"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>mapUsingService</span><span>(</span>keywordService<span>,</span> <span>PetClinicIndexJob</span><span>::</span><span>enrichWithKeywords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The method <code>enrichWithKeywords</code> simply passes the description field from
the change record to the keyword extraction service and sets the results
into the keywords field of the Visit instance.</p>
<p>It is a common pattern to enrich an item in a pipeline with more
information.  Hazelcast Jet works with POJOs in the pipeline, so you
need to somehow compose the original item and the enriching information.
One option is to use tuples.  This works for a small number of fields.
Another option would be to use a domain-specific object holding all the
information - e.g. the <code>keywords</code> field.  If you are on Java 14 or
newer, you might want to give the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359">Records preview
feature</a> a try.</p>
<h3>Joining</h3>
<p>Change data capture sends changes to the database as individual records
(represented by
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/javadoc/4.2/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/ChangeRecord.html">ChangeRecord</a>).
Each record represents a changed row in a database table. If a single
row is all that you need, you are good to go. You can see such example
in our <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/16/designing-evergreen-cache-cdc">Evergreen Cache blog
post</a>.  But having a
single row to work with is not always the case - often you need to
aggregate either multiple records from the same table or join records
from different tables into a single aggregate record.</p>
<p>In our case, we need to join 3 tables into a single document, which we
then index into Elasticsearch. To perform the joining we will use
<code>mapStateful</code> step. This can be performed either globally or partitioned
on a grouping key. If all your records share a common key it is always a
good idea to do the grouping by the key, because the mapping state is
then evenly distributed across all nodes and the mapping operation
parallelized.</p>
<p>Our visit record contains the pet ID but not the owner ID, in such case,
so we don’t have a single grouping key for all records. There are two
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform the stateful mapping globally, which has the advantage of
having a single state - the joining logic is simpler and the pipeline
more straightforward. The obvious disadvantage is that such a solution
is not scalable because the state may not fit onto a single member and
must be performed by a single thread;</p></li>
<li><p>create two separate mapping steps - one grouped on the owner ID and
the other on the pet ID. This is a trade-off between simplicity and
scalability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several observations which hold for both implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the mapping state must cover all data from the beginning, unless there
is a domain-specific rule that would allow eviction of old items;</p></li>
<li><p>the records might arrive in any order, even if there is a foreign key
between the records in the database, the order is not guaranteed, this
is a property of CDC.</p></li>
<li><p>once the object is emitted from the join step, it must not be
modified, otherwise the later stages might see it in inconsistent
state, causing issues which are hard …</p></li></ul></span></p></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="b291">Iâ€™ve always been interested in systems programming, and after obtaining my CS degree I got the opportunity to start a PhD at Ghent University, Belgium, right when Julia was first released around 2012. The language seemed intriguing, and since I wanted to gain some experience with LLVM, I decided to port some image processing research code from MATLAB and C++ to Julia. The goal was to match performance of the C++ version, but some of its kernels were implemented in CUDA Câ€¦ So obviously Julia needed a GPU back-end!</p><p id="7f14">That was easier said than done, of course, and much of my PhD was about implementing that back-end and (re)structuring the existing Julia compiler to facilitate these additional back-ends. Nowadays Iâ€™m at Julia Computing, where I still work on everything GPU-related.</p><h2 id="8f7f">What is JuliaGPU? What is the goal of the project?</h2><p id="43d9">JuliaGPU is the name we use to group GPU-related resources in Julia: Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU" rel="noopener">GitHub organization</a> where most packages are hosted, a <a href="https://juliagpu.org/" rel="noopener">website</a> to point the way for new users, we have <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/gitlab-ci" rel="noopener">CI infrastructure</a> for JuliaGPU projects, thereâ€™s a Slack channel and Discourse category, etc.</p><p id="ceaa">The goal of all this is to make it easier to use GPUs for all kinds of users. Current technologies often impose significant barriers to entry: CUDA is fairly tricky to install, C and C++ are not familiar to many users, etc. With the software we develop as part of the JuliaGPU organization, we aim to make it easy to use GPUs, without hindering the ability to optimize or use low-level features that the hardware has to offer.</p><h2 id="5da7">What is GPU computing? How important is it nowadays?</h2><p id="4de0">GPU computing means using the GPU, a device originally designed for graphics processing, to perform general-purpose computations. It has grown more important now that CPU performance is not improving as steadily as it used to. Instead, specialized devices like GPUs or FPGAs are increasingly used to improve the performance of certain computations. In the case of GPUs, the architecture is a great fit to perform highly-parallel applications. Machine learning networks are a good example of such parallel applications, and their popularity is one of the reasons GPUs have become so important.</p><h2 id="f596">Do you think Julia is an appropriate language to efficiently use GPU capabilities? Why?</h2><p id="775f">Juliaâ€™s main advantage is that the language was designed to be compiled. Even though the syntax is high-level, the generated machine code is<br>compact and has great performance characteristics (for more details, see <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla18b.pdf" rel="noopener">this paper</a>). This is crucial for GPU execution, where we are required to run native binaries and cannot easily (or efficiently) interpret code as is often required by other languageâ€™s semantics.</p><p id="b90b">Because weâ€™re able to directly compile Julia for GPUs, we can use almost all of the languageâ€™s features to build powerful abstractions. For example, you can define your own types, use those in GPU arrays, compose that with existing abstractions like lazy "Transpose" wrappers, access those on the GPU while benefiting from automatic bounds-checking (if needed), etc.</p><h2 id="824e">From a Python programmer perspective, how does CUDA.jl compare to PyCUDA? Are their functionalities equivalent?</h2><p id="cf3f">PyCUDA gives the programmer access to the CUDA APIs, with high-level Python functions that are much easier to use. CUDA.jl provides the same, but in Julia. The `hello world` from PyCUDAâ€™s home page looks almost identical in Julia:</p><pre><span id="a986">using CUDA</span><span id="03e4">function multiply_them(dest, a, b)<br> i = threadIdx().x<br> dest[i] = a[i] * b[i]<br> return<br>end</span><span id="9e7d">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="5833">dest = similar(a)<br>@cuda threads=400 multiply_them(dest, a, b)</span><span id="1372">println(dest-a.*b)</span></pre><p id="396f">Thereâ€™s one very big difference: "multiply_them" here is a function written in Julia, whereas PyCUDA uses a kernel written in CUDA C. The reason is straightforward: Python is not simple to compile. Of course, projects like Numba prove that it is very much possible to do so, but in the end those are separate compilers that try to match the reference Python compilers as closely as possible. With CUDA.jl, we integrate with that reference compiler, so itâ€™s much easier to guarantee consistent semantics and follow suit when the language changes (for more details,<br>refer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03112" rel="noopener">this paper</a>).</p><h2 id="5cf6">Are the packages in the JuliaGPU organization targeted to experienced programmers only?</h2><p id="6590">Not at all. CUDA.jl targets different kinds of (GPU) programmers. If you are confident writing your own kernels, you can do so, while using all of the low-level features CUDA GPUs have to offer. But if you are new to the world of GPU programming, you can use high-level array operations that use existing kernels in CUDA.jl. For example, the above element-wise multiplication could just as well be written as:</p><pre><span id="9c1f">using CUDA</span><span id="476a">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="efdf">dest = a .* b</span></pre><h2 id="4c26">Is it necessary to know how to code in CUDA.jl to take full advantage of GPU computing in Julia?</h2><p id="208b">Not for most users. Julia has a powerful language of generic array operations ("map", "reduce", "broadcast", "accumulate", etc) which can be applied to all kinds of arrays, including GPU arrays. That means you can often re-use your codebase developed for the CPU with CUDA.jl (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997818310123" rel="noopener">this paper</a> shows some powerful examples). Doing so often requires minimal changes: changing the array type, making sure you use array operations instead of for loops, etc.</p><p id="672d">Itâ€™s possible you need to go beyond this style of programming, e.g., because your application doesnâ€™t map cleanly onto array operations, to use specific GPU features, etc. In that case, some basic knowledge about CUDA and the GPU programming model is sufficient to write kernels in CUDA.jl.</p><h2 id="1a33">How is the experience of coding a kernel in CUDA.jl in comparison to CUDA C and how transferable is the knowledge to one another?</h2><p id="6a08">Itâ€™s very similar, and thatâ€™s by design: We try to keep the kernel abstractions in CUDA.jl close to their CUDA C counterparts such that the programming environment is familiar to existing GPU programmers. Of course, by using a high-level source language thereâ€™s many quality-of-life improvements. You can allocated shared memory, for example, statically and dynamically as in CUDA C, but instead of a raw pointers we use an N-dimensional array object you can easily index. An example from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/" rel="noopener">NVIDIA developer blog</a>:</p><pre><span id="ef8a">__global__ void staticReverse(int *d, int n)<br>{<br> __shared__ int s[64];<br> int t = threadIdx.x;<br> int tr = n-t-1;<br> s[t] = d[t];<br> __syncthreads();<br> d[t] = s[tr];<br>}</span></pre><p id="9cb0">The CUDA.jl equivalent of this kernel looks very familiar, but uses array objects instead of raw pointers:</p><pre><span id="996c">function staticReverse(d)<br> s = @cuStaticSharedMem(Int, 64)<br> t = threadIdx().x<br> tr = length(d)-t+1<br> s[t] = d[t]<br> sync_threads()<br> d[t] = s[tr]<br> return<br>end</span></pre><p id="9a14">Using array objects has many advantages, e.g. multi-dimensional is greatly simplified and we can just do "d[i,j]". But itâ€™s also safer, because these accesses are bounds checked:</p><pre><span id="3d65">julia&gt; a = CuArray(1:64)<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> â‹®<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64</span><span id="0d9c">julia&gt; @cuda threads=65 staticReverse(a)<br>ERROR: a exception was thrown during kernel execution.<br>Stacktrace:<br> [1] throw_boundserror at abstractarray.jl:541</span></pre><p id="c17a">Bounds checking isnâ€™t free, of course, and once weâ€™re certain our code is correct we can add an "@inbounds" annotation to our kernel and get the high-performance code we expect:</p><pre><span id="6846">julia&gt; @device_code_ptx @cuda threads=64 staticReverse(a)<br>.visible .entry staticReverse(.param .align 8 .b8 d[16]) {<br> .reg .b32 %r&lt;2&gt;;<br> .reg .b64 %rd&lt;15&gt;;<br> .shared .align 32 .b8 s[512];</span><span id="09c9">mov.b64 %rd1, d;<br> ld.param.u64 %rd2, [%rd1];<br> ld.param.u64 %rd3, [%rd1+8];<br> mov.u32 %r1, %tid.x;<br> cvt.u64.u32 %rd4, %r1;<br> mul.wide.u32 %rd5, %r1, 8;<br> add.s64 %rd6, %rd5, -8;<br> add.s64 %rd7, %rd3, %rd6;<br> ld.global.u64 %rd8, [%rd7+8];<br> mov.u64 %rd9, s;<br> add.s64 %rd10, %rd9, %rd6;<br> st.shared.u64 [%rd10+8], %rd8;<br> bar.sync 0;<br> sub.s64 %rd11, %rd2, %rd4;<br> shl.b64 %rd12, %rd11, 3;<br> add.s64 %rd13, %rd9, %rd12;<br> ld.shared.u64 %rd14, [%rd13+-8];<br> st.global.u64 [%rd7+8], %rd14;<br> ret;<br>}</span><span id="4489">julia&gt; a<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 64<br> 63<br> 62<br> â‹®<br> 3<br> 2<br> 1</span></pre><p id="3cee">Tools like "@device_code_ptx" make it easy for an experienced developer to inspect generated code and ensure the compiler does what he wants.</p><h2 id="164a">Why does having a compiler have such an impact in libraries like CUDA.jl? (How was the process of integrating it to the Julia compiler?)</h2><p id="e360">Because we have a compiler at our disposal, we can rely on higher-order functions and other generic abstractions that specialize based on the arguments that users provide. That greatly simplifies our library, but also gives the user very powerful tools. As an example, we have carefully implemented a `mapreduce` function that uses shared memory, warp intrinsics, etc to perform a high-performance reduction. The implementation is generic though, and will automatically re-specialize (even at run time) based on the arguments to the function:</p><pre><span id="9da7">julia&gt; mapreduce(identity, +, CuArray([1,2,3]))<br>6</span><span id="c680">julia&gt; mapreduce(sin, *, CuArray([1.1,2.2,3.3]))<br>-0.11366175839582586</span></pre><p id="52e8">With this powerful `mapreduce` …</p></div></div></section></div>

<h2><strong>A waterfall of old-schoolness&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p>I worked as a developer using Waterfall for exactly 9 months. I was 22 years old and it was my first programmer job and first corporate environment. This place was old school. Like suit-wearing, personal cubicle type old school. Our CEO would hold all-hands meetings where everyone was required to stand the whole time and he would call people up to give speeches at random because he believed everyone should be good at public speaking.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>22 year old Dan was NOT good at public speaking 🙂&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>







<p>At one offsite event, the CEO designated me as the company Complaint Manager. During the 4-day event employees were directed to give me their complaints. Of course my friends dropped anonymous and hilarious complaints because they knew that, at the end of each day, I was going to be called up to the stage to repeat back all of the complaints. What?!? Super old school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One time, I was sent to work at a client’s office for a week, just so they could visibility see my team working on their project. And I mean that in the most literal sense. We didn’t have any meetings or recent project updates, they just wanted to make sure we were actually working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I never saw a single line of my code in production during my 9 months I spent working there. I actually remember learning that my project was finally being sent to QA for testing the week I left. After 9 months. Old. School.</p>



<p>But I didn’t know any better at the time. I hadn’t heard of Agile yet, and no one told me we were doing Waterfall. Luckily I got out of there and found a job at Cloudlock where I learned about Agile and eventually worked my way up to VP of Engineering. But I’ll never forget my first year as a Waterfall programmer.</p>



<p>So does methodology matter? Absolutely. But…&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>We do agile… But</strong></h2>







<p>If you ask a software developer&nbsp; what methodology they follow, 95% of us will say we do agile…but, usually followed by some version of Scrum or Kanban. While this sounds like a worldwide consensus, the reality is that every dev team I’ve worked on or managed has had a different development process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During my time as VP of Engineering at Cloudlock, I looked after 75 developers across 5 teams. Each team had their own unique process. There were team leads who had been working in software development for 25+ years and others that had <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/">just gotten promoted</a>. The younger leads liked having a more strict process to follow, whereas the more senior managers had a process they had customized over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of those teams built amazing software even though their methods differed per team. Why? Because software development is not a zero sum game. Just because one team is successful using Agile Scrum doesn’t mean another team will be less successful using Agile Kanban. Or Scrumban. Or SAFe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of options out there so, instead of focusing on methodology, I find it makes sense to start with what you’re trying to do and work backwards.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>A bespoke development process – The GigSmart dev team&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p><em>“You got rid of teams?!?”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I recently caught up with my friend Chris Downard, VP of Engineering at GigSmart, to chat about dev methodology changes in light of current events. I was completely taken aback when the first thing he said to me was that he just got rid of teams in his engineering department.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>I’m not personally strict about following this or that development method, but getting rid of teams felt a little extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris: “It naturally evolved that way. Because of this remote culture that we adopted very rapidly, we just found that the back end people tended to support each other on their backend tickets; whether or not it was on their direct team or a direct feature they were working on. They were helping each other, committing to each other’s code, etc. So we kept the team thing going up until last month, and we were measuring that way, so we just eliminated it because it didn’t make sense anymore.”</p>



<p>Getting rid of teams works for Chris for two reasons. He runs a small-ish team of 14 developers and the team uses a Kanban style framework. If there are 3 or 4 features in flight, each team member is assigned to one as their dominant project, but they’re all on one team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the classic Scrum ceremonies are still followed, but he’s working on making them more effective as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do one large standup and it takes us 15 minutes to get through. People give their standup updates in order based on their dominant feature. So the first set of people who go, are the ones who are working on Feature A, and the second group that goes are all working on Feature B.”</p>



<p>On top of no teams and restructuring their daily, Chris says they work in sprints but use a Kanban board to increase speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The product team loves that because if they decide that something is suddenly really hot because sales has run into this or that, we can address it immediately.”</p>

<h3><strong>Why does GigSmart work this way?&nbsp;</strong></h3>







<ul><li>Chris believes in continuous improvement based on team feedback.</li></ul>







<p>When he runs sprint retros, anything that engineering brings up that isn’t working, they have a conversation about. He brings in product and they chat about ways to make it better, and then they test it. And if it doesn’t work, he readjusts, and tries to fix it. Since he started at GigSmart, there hasn’t been a 4 week period where their process has stayed the same.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="2"><li>GigSmart’s most valuable outcome is speed.</li></ul>







<p>The methodology, process, or ethos that drives your team needs to be purpose built to achieve the outcome you want. At GigSmart they’re defined outcome was high quality and speed. As an on-demand staffing platform, they choose to prioritize hotfixes and bugs. Other companies might need to be more predictable, quality-driven, stable, consistent, etc. based on their business type and needed outcome.</p>







<ul start="3"><li>GigSmart is culture-driven&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>“Build better, more engaged engineering teams… That’s probably what my actual official job description is. So culture really matters.” <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/our-dev-culture-is-based-on-bushido-samurai-code-my-interview-with-the-vp-of-engineering-at-gigsmart/">Chris and GigSmart CTO,&nbsp; Jason Waldrip, modeled their team cultural values</a> on the ancient samurai code of Bushido. 8 values that they’ve written down and strive to live and work by every day.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="4"><li>GigSmart is data-driven</li></ul>







<p>Measuring is not enough, you have to measure with a purpose. You get what you measure. Everyone is familiar with this saying. Chris takes it a step further and actually encourages the team to look data about how they work in all of their day-to-day practices and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining his company’s most valuable outcome and listening to his developers, Chris has created a development process that is bespoke to his team today. Just like a custom tailored suit, his development method cannot be easily used by another company. It had to be made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes I just like building my own thing from the ground up. It’s why I started <a href="https://linearb.io/">LinearB.</a> Do you NEED to create your own development method? Definitely not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s much easier to start with Scrum or Kanban and adapt from there. But times, they are a changin’, and maybe this is a good year to go through the exercise of redefining how you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we started full-time remote back in March, my co-founder, Ori Keren, and I did just that. We created <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/asynchronous-development/">Asynchronous Development</a>, a development methodology designed around async communication and purpose-built for hybrid remote teams. It’s our favorite parts of Agile. A little bit of Scrum. A lot of what Ori and I learned over the years that really works for us. And a big dose of where we think the future of software development teamwork is headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hundreds of teams are now following the Async Dev methodology. If we can make up our own dev methodology, you can too!&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Here’s 4 guiding ideas that will help you make up your own dev methodology</strong></p>







<ol><li><strong>Know your “why”&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>What matters to you? If it’s aligning to your company’s most important business goals, do you&nbsp; know what they are? Start-ups tend to want lots of new features as quickly as possible. More mature companies like predictability and quality. Find out and work backwards from there.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="2"><li><strong>Don’t be dogmatic</strong></li></ol>







<p>Forget about the rules and just ask yourself… “How do we really want to work?” Ask your people. Especially your out-of-the-box thinkers. The more crazy ideas you throw in the mix, the more discussion you’ll create and the more you’ll end up with something that is really bespoke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the Agile manifesto says face-to-face communication is the most efficient way to transfer information. Is that still true for your team?</p>







<ol start="3"><li><strong>Retro your current process</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong><br></strong>Ask… “Why are we doing all of these things we do every day?” Do you really need a daily stand-up? Do you really need two week sprints? Are you realy getting value from them? The answer may be yes. But I bet if your team will have a lot of ideas of how they could be more dev-friendly and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="4"><li><strong>Bring data to the conversation&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>After you’re done exploring all of the pain from step 3, see if you can prove or disprove any of the assumptions and anecdotes with actual data. This might be the hard part, actually. The type of data you need is not necessarily accessible in your Git or project management system. If you need help, check out LinearB. Our <a href="https://linearb.io/pricing/">free-forever plan</a> provides tons of metrics and process visualizations to show you what’s working, bottlenecks and how you can improve efficiency, quality and teamwork. <a href="https://app.linearb.io/register">Click here to sign up</a> with your Git account.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>What’s your made up methodology?</strong></p>







<p>I know many of you have already customized your own dev methodology. I’d love to hear about it! What pieces of existing methods did you use? What new things did you invent? What is special about your approach? Please …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>In one particular context.</p>


<p>A while back, a colleague wanted to make a major change in the design of a system, the sort of change that was going to take a year or more, and many tens of person-years of effort. They asked me how to justify the project. This post is part of the email reply I sent. The advice is in context of technical leadership work at a big company, but perhaps it may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right solution?</strong></p>

<p>I like to pay attention to ways I can easily fool myself. One of those ways is an <em>availability heuristic</em> applied to big problems. I see a big problem that needs a big solution, and am strongly biased to believe that the first big solution that presents itself is the right one. It takes intentional effort to figure out whether the big solution is, indeed, a solution to the big problem. Bold action, after all, isn't a solution itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, in one of his more exuberant or desperate moods, Pa would go out in the veld and sprinkle brandy on the daisies to make them drunk so that they wouldn't feel the pain of shriveling up and dying. (André Brink)</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I am so easily fooled in this way, I like to write my reasoning down. Two pages of prose normally does it, building an argument as to why this is the right solution to the problem. Almost every time, this exposes flaws in my reasoning, opportunities to find more data, or other solutions to explore. Thinking in my head doesn't have this effect for me, but writing does. Or, rather, the exercise of writing and reading does.</p>

<p>The first step is to write a succinct description of the problem, and what it means for the problem to be solved. Sometimes those are quantitative goals. Speeds and feeds. Sometimes, they are concrete goals. A product launch, or a document. Sometimes, it's something more qualitative and harder to explain. Thinking about the problem bears a great deal of fruit.</p>

<p>Then, the solution. The usual questions apply here, including cost, viability, scope and complexity. Most important is engaging with the problem statement. It's easy to make the exercise useless if you disconnect the problem statement from the solution.</p>

<p>It is important you feel comfortable with the outcome of this exercise, because losing faith in your own work is a sure way to have it fail. Confidence is one valuable outcome. Another one is a simpler solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right problem?</strong></p>

<p>An elegant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all, at least in that it might fool people into thinking that the true problem has been solved, and to stop trying. You need to deeply understand the problem you are solving. Rarely, this will be an exercise only in technology or engineering. More commonly, large problems will span business, finance, engineering, management and more. You probably don't understand all of these things. Be sure to seek the help of people who do.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I think I understand multiple perspectives on a problem, I like to write them down and run them by the people who explained the problem to me. They'll be able to point out where you're still wrong. Perhaps you're confusing your net and operational margins, or your hiring targets make no sense, or your customers see a different problem from you. This requires that the people you consult trust you, and you trust them. Fortunately, non-engineers in engineering organizations are always looking out for allies and friends. Most are, like engineers, only too excited to explain their work.</p>

<p><strong>Engage with the doubters, but don't let them get you down</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you (Tom Lehrer)</p></blockquote>

<p>You will never convince everybody of your point of view. By now, you have two powerful tools to help convince people: A clear statement of the problem that considers multiple points-of-view, and a clear statement of the solution. Some people will read those and be convinced. Others would never be convinced, because their objections lie beyond the scope of your thinking. A third group will have real, honest, feedback about the problem and proposed solution. That feedback is gold that should be mined. Unfortunately, separating the golden nuggets of feedback from the pyrite nuggets of doubt isn't easy.</p>

<p>The doubters will get you down. Perhaps they think the problem doesn't exist, or that the solution is impractical. Perhaps they think you aren't the person to do it. Perhaps they think the same resources should be spent on a different problem, or a different solution. You'll repeat, repeat, and repeat. Get used to it. I'm still not used to it, but you should be.</p>

<p>Again, writing is a tool I reach for. "Today, I'm doubting my solution because..." Sometimes that doubt will be something more about you than the project. That's OK. Sometime it'll be about the project, and will identify a real problem. Often, it'll just point to one of those unknown unknowns that all projects have.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the stakeholders where they are</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, you're going to need to convince somebody to let you do the work. That's good, because doing big things requires time, people and money. You don't want to be working somewhere that's willing to waste time, people or money. If they're willing to waste time on your ill-conceived schemes, they'll be willing to waste your time on somebody else's ill-conceived schemes.</p>

<blockquote><p>May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. (C.S. Lewis)</p></blockquote>

<p>The best advice I've received about convincing stakeholders is to write for them, not you. Try to predict what questions they are going to ask, what concerns they will have, and what objections they will bring up and have answers for those in the text. That doesn't mean you should be defensive. Don't aim only to flatter. Instead, tailor your approach. It can help to have the advice of people who've been through this journey before.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph may seem to you like <em>politics</em>, you may have a distaste for politics, or believe you can escape it by moving to a different business. It is. You may. You can't.</p>

<p>Leadership willing to engage with your ideas and challenge you on them is a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Build a team</strong></p>

<p>You need to build two teams. Your local team is the team of engineers who are going to help you write, review, test, deploy, operate, and so on. These people are critical to your success, not because they are the fingers to your brain, but because the details are at least as important as the big picture. Get into some details yourself. Don't get into every detail. You can't.</p>

<p>Your extended team is a group of experts, managers, customer-facing folks, product managers, lawyers, designers and so on. Some of these people won't be engaged day-to-day. You need to find them, get them involved, and draw on them when you need help. You're not an expert in everything, but expertise in everything will be needed. Getting these people excited about your project, and bought into its success, is important.</p>

<p>Finally, find yourself a small group of people you trust, and ask them to keep you honest. Check in with them, to make sure your ideas still make sense. Share the documents you wrote with them.</p>

<p><strong>Be willing to adapt</strong></p>

<p>You will learn, at some point into doing your big project, that your solution is bullshit. You completely misunderstood the problem. You may feel like this leaves you back at the beginning, where you started. It doesn't. Instead, you've stepped up your level of expertise. Most likely, you can adapt that carefully-considered solution to the new problem, but you might need to throw it out entirely. Again, write it down. Be specific. What have you learned, and what did it teach you? Look for things you can recover, and don't throw things out prematurely.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from software development, I also enjoy studying other related fields like marketing, project management, and product management.</p><p>Any reasonably sized software needs planning to be executed properly and after you "finish it" (a software product is never actually "done"), you need to market it to the public in order to make sales.</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process I took to become a Project Management Professional (PMP) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), one of the most sought certifications, not only in project management but in the market as a whole.</p><p>I was able to start my studies and take the test successfully in 2 months, studying between 3 and 4 hours a day, every day, weekends included, and get the results below:</p><p>Overall performance:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-overall-performance.png" alt="Initial"></p><p>Performance by domain:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-exam-breakdown.png" alt="Initial"></p><h2>What is the PMI and the PMP?</h2><p>The PMI (Project management institute) is the main organization when you think about project management.</p><p>Project Management varies a lot from place to place, from project to project, and from industry to industry, but there are some standards across all of those that are considered general best practices.</p><p>The PMI publishes the PMBoK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), which is a guide of best practices in project management.</p><p>The PMBoK is <strong>not</strong> a methodology, the project team needs to decide which processes will be applied according to their needs.</p><p>The PMBoK is usually updated every 4 or 5 years with new practices and a review of the current ones.</p><h2>PMP Certification requirements</h2><p>To apply for the test, you have to meet some criteria as described by the official PMI page:</p><ul><li>A four-year degree</li><li>36 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p><strong>OR</strong></p><ul><li>A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent)</li><li>60 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p>You can find everything you need to know about the application and the certification process itself on the official page of the exam at <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)®</a>.</p><h2>What do you need to prepare</h2><p>I had 3 things at hand to prepare:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">The PMBoK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Updated/dp/1932735658">Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</a></li><li>An exam simulator</li></ul><h3>The PMBoK</h3><p>This is PMI’s official resource to study. In a sense, it contains everything you need regarding topics.</p><p>The problem is that the PMBoK alone is a little too dry to study for the exam and it doesn’t have exercises to practice.</p><p>This is simply because the PMBoK is a reference book, not a study guide.</p><p>The best way to get a copy is to register as a PMI Associate. As an associate, you get a free copy of the PMBoK and you also get a good discount on the exam fee.</p><h3>Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</h3><p>This is the book you want to have with you as your best friend.</p><p>Unlike the PMBoK, Rita’s book is a written course to help you organize ideas and absorb the topics of the exam with questions at the end of each chapter.</p><p>This one is a must, although kind of expensive, but not so much if you compare it with a live or online course that might cost you thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred like the book.</p><p>And the book has a huge advantage compared to a course: you can resell the book to somebody else and recover most of the investment you made or you can even buy a used copy from someone and save a buck.</p><h3>Exam simulator</h3><p>I did the exam back in 2018 and the simulator I used is no longer available, so I won’t recommend any specific simulator because I only recommend things I have used and can guarantee they actually work.</p><p>You can search for a "PMP exam simulator" on the internet and find lots of them.</p><p>Look for reviews to find a good one, these might be pricey, but they are worth it if you want to pass the exam.</p><p>A good simulator should allow you to practice questions by specific areas, so you can focus on one at a time when studying.</p><p>And, of course, they must have a good enough amount of questions so you can practice at least 2 complete exams, similar to the one you are actually going to take on the test day.</p><h2>How to study</h2><p>You might not be able to take the exam in 2 months and that’s ok! Actually, most people take between 3 and 6 months of study before taking the exam.</p><p>I will describe the process I used to study, each person has a rhythm and different constraints in life, so adapt this to a schedule you can actually keep.</p><p>1 – Read Rita’s book in parallel with the PMBoK, then answer the questions at the end of each chapter of Rita’s book.<br> 2 – Once a week, at least, answer questions on the exam simulator by area. Do not attempt to mix questions of many areas at first, let each one sink in.<br> 3 – Review the areas in which you are not scoring well in the simulator. You don’t need a perfect score and a good simulator will tell you where you should focus to get better.<br> 4 – Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 until you finish all the chapters in Rita’s book.<br> 5 – As soon as you feel comfortable, try as many complete exams simulator as you can, I would say something between 2 and 4 are enough.</p><p>I did 2 complete exams, on two different days, a week before the test.</p><p>You mustn’t let anyone distract you, lock yourself in a room and simulate the environment of the test so you get a feel of how to behave on the test day and how to manage your time appropriately.</p><h2>The exam day</h2><p>If you followed all steps described before and had good scores on the simulator, don’t worry, you are good to go!</p><p>Just one last tip: don’t get stuck on a question.</p><p>The exam is 4 hours long and has 200 questions, this means you have, on average 1.2 minutes per question!</p><p>Some questions will feel easier, some will feel harder, that’s normal, no one has all the answers, if you feel stuck on one question mark it for later and review it at the end if you have some time left.</p><p>Prepare well, keep calm, and good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><h4><em>Manage the content of your Next.js apps through a free Git-based CMS</em></h4><p>If you’re starting a new React project, you might want to consider <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>. In this article, we take a look at why this would be a great choice and walk through the process of setting up a new project using these technologies.</p><h2>Why Next.js?</h2><p>As I stated in <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-typescript-5f912766c88">a previous article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“There are many important details you need to consider when you start a new project with React. Your code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.</p><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Create React App</a> can be a nice tool to handle this for you and give you a massive head start, but what about code-splitting, pre-rendering for performance, and SEO or server-side rendering?</p><p>To build a complete React application, you need more than CRA provides you with. You can save yourself some time by using Next.js, a React framework that provides a solution to all of these problems.”</p></blockquote><p>If you want to read more about CRA vs. Next.js, check out <a href="https://codeburst.io/stack-choices-create-react-app-vs-next-js-f0f3c4db7083">Stack choices: Create React App vs Next.js</a>.</p><h2>Why Netlify CMS?</h2><p><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> is an open-source Git-based content management system. It is based on client-side JavaScript and handles content updates directly in Git. Because all content is just stored in your Git repository, you don’t need to have anything hosted on a server. It’s completely free and a great fit to combine with Next.js to build landing pages or blogs that are manageable through a nice UI.</p><h2>Let’s Begin</h2><p>Let’s begin building our landing page with some basic text to get familiar with Netlify CMS. You can find the source code of this part of the tutorial <a href="https://github.com/jakeprins/nextjs-netlify-cms">on GitHub</a> or check out <a href="http://serverless.page/">serverless.page</a> for a complete boilerplate that also includes features like authentication and billing.</p><h3>Set up your project</h3><p>You can start by creating a new Next.js project with <code>npx create-next-app</code>. In this example, we are going to use TypeScript. You can follow <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-typescript-5f912766c88">this tutorial</a> on how to set up Next.js with Typescript.</p><h2>Using Markdown Files for Our Content</h2><p>Netlify CMS works with markdown files, and it’s a great way to manage the content of your landing page or blog. Let’s begin by creating a markdown file that will have some data we want to show on our home screen.</p><p>Make a <code>content</code> directory that will hold all our markdown files. Next, create a <code>pages</code> directory and a markdown file called <code>content/pages/home.md</code>. This file will hold the data that we want to show on our home page. Let’s start by adding a title, description, and image for the “hero” section of our landing page:</p><pre><code><span>--</span><span>-</span><span>
</span><span>hero_title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Build</span><span> a </span><span>SaaS</span><span> faster </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>
</span><span>hero_description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Serverless</span><span> </span><span>SaaS</span><span> is aiming to be the perfect starting point </span><span>for</span><span> your next </span><span>React</span><span> app to build full</span><span>-</span><span>stack </span><span>SaaS</span><span> applications</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Visit</span><span> serverless</span><span>.</span><span>page</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> more info</span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span></code></pre><p>Next, we need to tell webpack how to load markdown files. Let’s use <code>frontmatter-markdown-loader</code> for this. Start by installing that package as a dev dependency:</p><pre><code><span>yarn add frontmatter</span><span>-</span><span>markdown</span><span>-</span><span>loader </span><span>-</span><span>D</span></code></pre><p>Next, create a new <code>next.config.js</code> file at the root of your project with the following content:</p><h3>Create the home page</h3><p>Cool, now let’s add some code to the index page to make it our home page.</p><p>In <code>pages/index.tsx</code>, add the following:</p><p>Let’s have a look at what’s going on here. The most important part is the exported <code>getStaticProps</code> function. If you export an <code>async</code> function called <code>getStaticProps</code> from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by <code>getStaticProps</code>.</p><p>On our page, we import our markdown file called <code>home.md</code> and pass it a <code>content</code> prop to our component. Our home page can now use the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> attributes of the markdown file.</p><p>Let’s try it out and see if it’s working:</p><pre><code><span>yarn dev</span></code></pre><p>You should see your amazing hero section, ready to be styled and managed with your upcoming CMS.</p><h2>Implement Netlify CMS</h2><p>There are different ways to add Netlify CMS to your project. We are going to use the official npm package:</p><pre><code><span>yarn add netlify</span><span>-</span><span>cms</span><span>-</span><span>app</span></code></pre><h3>Add the configuration</h3><p>Before we can initialize our CMS, we need to create a config file. Create a <code>cms</code> directory at the root of your project and paste the following configuration to your <code>cms/config.js</code>:</p><pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

We are going to use this config file to tell Netlify CMS that we want to use the GitHub for this. For repositories stored on GitHub, the <code>github</code> back end allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to their content repository for this to work.</p><p>If you haven’t done already, now would be a good time to <a href="https://github.com/new">create your repository on GitHub</a>, add the name of your repo to the config file, and push your code to GitHub. Go ahead — I’ll wait.</p><p>Good, but before we move on, let’s take a look at the most important setting of our configuration: the <code>collections</code>. This determines how content types and editor fields in the UI generate files and content in your repository.</p><p>Inside <code>collections</code>, we create a <code>pages</code> collection that has some settings for the <code>home</code> page. For now, we only added the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> fields. You can set which <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/#header">widget</a> to use for the given property.</p><p>You can read about all other configuration options <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options">in the documentation</a>.</p><h3>Initialize the CMS</h3><p>Next, let’s create an admin page for our CMS. Add the following code to <code>pages/admin.tsx</code>:</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>dynamic</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'next/dynamic'</span><span>;</span><span>

<span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>AdminPage</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now you should be able to navigate to <a href="https://localhost:4202/">http://localhost:3000/admin</a> and see a GitHub login button. Hit the button and see your nice new CMS!</p><img alt="Blank CMS" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sCq_bD6q9UjrCg-YhKpL_A.png" width="1058" height="369"><h3>Try it out</h3><p>Cool, now try it out! Select “Home” and you will see the edit page. You can edit the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> properties and click the <code>publish</code> button. When you publish, Netlify CMS is making a commit to your repository with the changes you just made. You can take a look at the last commit after you have published some changes.</p><p>Now, all you have to do is <code>git pull</code> to get those changes locally and navigate back to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. You will see that the home page contains your changes. Sweet!</p><h2>Adding Images</h2><p>Most hero sections contain a pretty image. Let’s use the <code>image</code> widget to add an image to our hero section. Go to your <code>cms/config.js</code> file and add the following object to the <code>fields</code> array:</p><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  label</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Hero Image'</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'hero_image'</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  widget</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'image'</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Next, we could simply add an image to our <code>public/img</code> folder and add it to our <code>home.md</code>, but to demonstrate how Netlify CMS works, we are going to use the CMS to do it.</p><p>First, we need to upload an image to our integrated media library. On the dashboard of the CMS, click the “Media” link in the top navbar and upload an image. After that, navigate to the edit screen of the home page.</p><p>You should now see the added <code>hero_image</code> field with a button that says, “Choose an image.” You can now select your uploaded image and publish the changes.</p><p>Great, we should now have a new commit to our repo with the new changes. If our application was already in production, we could see the changes live, but since we want to see these changes locally, we need to first pull them from GitHub.</p><p>After you have run <code>git pull</code>, there is really only one thing left to do, which is adding the image to our home page:</p><pre><code><span>...</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>img src</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>attributes</span><span>.</span><span>hero_image</span><span>}</span><span> alt</span><span>=</span><span>'hero image'</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>...</span></code></pre><p>Now, run <code>yarn dev</code> and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> to see your added image!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Netlify CMS is a very useful library you can add to your Next.js apps. It’s just a client-side React application, and it uses Git to store content in your own repository. This has some nice benefits: You don’t need to host your CMS separately and it fits perfectly in your Git workflow. This is great for managing the content of a landing page or blog post.</p><p>If you are looking for a complete boilerplate, check out <a href="http://serverless.page/">serverless.page</a>.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>We have covered a lot in this tutorial, but we have only seen the basics of how Netlify CMS works in a Next.js application.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <div>
  <div>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app here, I want to start this blog post with a disclaimer:</p>
    <p>This describes a <em>minor</em> security flaw in the app which has no impact on its ability to function as part of a track &amp; trace system. I also want to be explicitly clear that this bug does not have any privacy impact whatsoever. Lastly, there is nothing nefarious about this bug. It's a mistake (largely on the part of a third-party dependency) and nothing more, one that is easily (and commonly) made.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 Android app, the official contact tracing app for England and Wales, uses signed JWT tokens for its “scan into a venue” feature but does not properly validate the signatures, meaning anyone could have forged their own venue QR codes.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is due to a mixture of JWTs being fundamentally difficult to verify correctly, and a particularly awful JWT library API.</p>

<p>I was able to discover the vulnerability from reading the source code, and getting the relevant app code running on my computer in a test harness to experiment with it.</p>

<p>I reported the vulnerability to the NHS team who fixed it very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The Full Story</h2>

<p>It all started, as many things do, with <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361">a Tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>okay i actually really wanted to know and its a JWT with</p><p>like</p><p>the whole dang address</p><p>and the name of the place just for shits and giggles <a href="https://t.co/1vx0bTD9zi">pic.twitter.com/1vx0bTD9zi</a></p></div>— laura mcflurry (@freezydorito) <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2020</a></blockquote>


<div><p>For those of you who don't know, these QR codes are for venues (such as pubs and bars) to display so customers can check in via the NHS (National Health Service) mobile app. This makes it faster and more convenient to track who was at the venue, in case they need to be contacted in the event someone else there tested positive for Coronavirus.</p></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the NHS venue QR codes are JWTs, and they are cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Like anyone in security, as soon as I heard the letters “JWT” I thought: “I wonder if they got the signature checking correct”.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: they didn’t:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle.png"><img src="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle-thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of a mobile phone app: Green check mark. Title: Successful check-in. Large text: Barnard Castle Eye Testing Facility. Smaller test: 30 Sep 2020, 12:53. Thank you for scanning. You have now checked in! You'll be automatically checked out at midnight or when you scan another official NHS QR code. Button: Back to home. Link: Cancel this check-in."></a></p>

<h2 id="background-jwts--signing">Background: JWTs &amp; Signing</h2>

<p>In case you don’t know what a JWT is, it’s an entirely unnecessary and rather over-complicated spec for encoding data in JSON format and: cryptographically signing it, so it cannot be altered; encrypting it, so it cannot be read; both; or – popularly (if accidentally) – neither.</p>

<p>This post is about signed JWTs, and forging signed JWTs, so I’m not going to mention encryption any more. From here on in, every time I say “JWT” I mean “unencrypted, but possibly signed, JWT”.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything about JWTs to follow along here, but you do need to know this much: A JWT consists of three parts: a , a <span>payload</span>, and a <span>signature</span> (optional). Here’s an example:</p>

<pre>.<span>eyJuYW1lIjoiem9mcmV4IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6ImhlbGxvLCB3b3JsZCEifQ</span>.<span>40IhxsQj3rVqfQSpdzZTroSs1onXrTJUsy6yC1SadK0</span></pre>

<p>Each part is Base64 encoded, which isn’t important here, and decoded it looks like this:</p>

<pre>.<span>{"name":"zofrex","message":"hello, world!"}</span>.&lt;<span>inscrutable crytographic soup&gt;</span></pre>

<p>The header tells whoever is verifying the JWT which cryptographic algorithm was used to sign it (“alg”), and optionally an identifier for the key it was signed with (“kid”).</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that JWTs are shoe-horned into being a solution for, and one very common one is for verifying data that is passed between services by an untrusted user. For example, service A produces a token and gives it to a user, who then presents the token to service B. Because the token is round-tripping through the user, it is important to make sure they haven’t altered it (or created it themselves), and the token really was generated by the first service.</p>

<p>In the context of the NHS App, “service A” is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">website that generates QR codes for venues to display</a>, and “Service B” is the NHS COVID-19 app. There are actually multiple untrusted users carrying the QR code from service A to service B: the venue owner who prints out the QR code and sticks it up on the wall, and any customers who scan the QR code with their phone. Because of the cryptographic signature, the app can verify that the QR code it scans really was created by the official website.</p>

<p>That’s the theory.</p>

<p>In security and cryptography circles, JWTs used in this way are practically synonymous with “alg=none” bugs. Remember that “alg” field in the header earlier? One of the options is “none”. This, as you may have guessed already, means no verification occurs. This has proven to be the single biggest footgun in the JWT specification, as despite seemingly being a very obvious trap to avoid, many JWT libraries out there hide these details from users and make it very easy to accidentally allow the “none” algorithm.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that this is <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">hilariously and depressingly common</a>, and well worth double-checking if you are investigating any system that uses JWTs or, heaven help you, building one. That’s why this was my first thought upon learning the NHS app uses JWTs, and why I wanted to check if they made this specific mistake.</p>

<h2 id="lets-take-a-look">Let’s Take A Look</h2>

<p>Both the NHS apps (Android and iOS) <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01157/en-us?parentid=CAT-01028&amp;rootid=CAT-01024">are open source</a>, so it’s very easy for someone like me –&nbsp;more accustomed to reading/writing source code than reverse engineering – to take a look. A quick search for “JWT” in each repo later and we find:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-ios-ag-public/blob/a15cebbda5c073f1e0f7b266105110d0d88a7b27/NHS-COVID-19/Core/Sources/Domain/CheckIn/Model/QRCode.swift">The iOS app</a>:</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(I’ve omitted code not relevant to the signature checking)</p>

<p>This looks fine. Sure, it’s a little bit weird to do the key checking yourself rather than defer to a JWT library for it. But on the other hand, it’s extremely obvious reading this code that it’s doing the right thing, at least as far as alg=none avoidance goes (I cannot vouch for the cryptography, however. I’m just an alg=none expert).</p>

<p>The key part here is that the signing algorithm is hardcoded to P256, so setting alg to “none” in the JWT itself will have no effect on verification. Additionally the key to use is also hardcoded: it’s passed in to the class via the constructor. The “kid” (key id) field in the JWT is <em>checked</em>, but ultimately thrown away. The JWT is not trusted to choose the algorithm or the key, and in that sense this is a great example of how to safely use JWTs, if you do absolutely have to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the payload of the JWT is not decoded or used at all until after the signature is verified. This isn’t really relevant to the alg=none issue, but it is good practice in general to only access signed data after verifying that it hasn’t been tampered with. In cryptography, this protects you from <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">clever cryptographic attacks</a>. With JWTs it ensures you don’t accidentally use attacker-provided data for any decisions in your code if the signature fails, and has a side-benefit of creating a layered defence to exploiting the JSON parser (historically a decent source of bugs).</p>

<p>Anyway, this code looks fine. Great! <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/blob/2e37797b9b7b5db5b393280a9ef8b93a19af4964/app/src/main/java/uk/nhs/nhsx/covid19/android/app/qrcode/QrCodeParser.kt">On to Android</a> (again, I’ve omitted irrelevant code):</p>

<p>Phew, there’s a lot more going on here! Let’s break it down:</p>

<p>We start in the <code>parse</code> function and after some basic data juggling, we parse the JWT. Then we check if the signature is correct, and if it isn’t, we bail:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>val</span> <span>jwt</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>parseJWT</span><span>(</span><span>jwtStrin…</span></code></pre></figure></div></article></div></div></div>

			<p><em>Abstract: A few weeks ago, Orca Security published a comparison between the Orca Cloud Security Platform and a few other cloud security tools—including a&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">comparison with Palo Alto Networks Prisma</a>. In response, Palo Alto Networks sent a <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cease and desist letter</a>, demanding the comparison be removed immediately. Here is my response. I urge you to see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnqJTEi6ynvsGkSJHYeEmhz6_NfzKgbf">the videos in question</a>&nbsp;and if you, like me, believe the cybersecurity community deserves transparency and vendors shouldn’t be allowed to prevent publishing reviews or benchmarks via legal threats, then please share this post. You can also leave your own comments down below.</em></p>
<p><strong>To: Palo Alto Networks</strong></p>
<p><strong>CC: The cybersecurity community</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: The Cybersecurity community demands transparency, not legal threats&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Security has always been about transparency. The concept of security by obscurity was frowned upon as early as 1851—even before the invention of electricity—when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Charles_Hobbs">Alfred Hobbs</a>, a Massachusetts-based locksmith, demonstrated how then state-of-the-art locks could be picked. He explained that exposing the information would make the public more secure, as rogues already knew the deficiencies. The public needed to be educated, and he’d pursue better locks. Today’s locks are more advanced, but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity community preaches about many products. All come with their own advantages and disadvantages, capabilities, and limitations. I believe that the only way practitioners can choose the tools that fit their environments best is by viewing factual evidence—not by relying solely on marketing materials. This is why we launched our&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/cloud-security-solutions/">Cloud Security Punch-Out! Series</a>, where we deploy a few tools—including Orca Security—on the exact same environment and share the results with viewers who deserve to see them. I urge you to take&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">a look at the one we did with Palo Alto Networks;</a>&nbsp;as you’ll see we don’t hide those areas where Palo Alto Networks shines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks is now trying to use legal threats to prevent us from publishing&nbsp;these video&nbsp;reviews. In <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its letter</a>, Palo Alto Networks does not point to any factual inaccuracies in the reviews of its products’ performance. Instead, it premises its threats on flimsy, boilerplate contract terms that prohibit reviews and comparisons of its products and hollow trademark allegations purporting that Palo Alto Networks is sponsoring the videos.</p>
<p>It’s outrageous that the world’s largest cybersecurity vendor (its products being used by over 65,000 organizations according to its website), believes that its users aren’t entitled to share any benchmark or performance comparison of its products. According to its boilerplate contract terms that prohibit “disclosing, publishing, or otherwise making publicly available any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests” of its products, you’re in violation even if you publish the results of an internal comparison of Palo Alto Networks against other products as part of your procurement process. The same goes for the hundreds of Palo Alto Networks reviews on various sites that include G2 Crowd, Capterra, and Gartner Peer Insights. It means that only benchmarks approved by Palo Alto Networks can be published.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks appears oblivious to the fact that the New York Attorney General’s office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2003579195misc2d3841519">sued and won an injunction</a>&nbsp;against McAfee from enforcing its contractual restrictions against publishing reviews or comparisons of its products without its consent more than 17 years ago. In enacting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45b">Consumer Review Fairness Act</a>, Congress has also prohibited businesses from including contract terms that prohibit consumers from reviewing products or services they purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>Palo Alto Networks, do you think your products are flawless or that the bad guys will follow along, not openly talking about products’ deficiencies? If the answer is no to both, then why resort to legal threats to remove such benchmarks and comparisons? I refuse to accept a world where any vendor believes it has the right to prevent the free flow of information, and control which product reviews are made publicly available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I urge you to make your products better and focus your marketing efforts on demonstrating that, rather than throwing away money on ill-conceived gag efforts. Such action doesn’t benefit anyone. If you believe we missed something in our test, then tell us so we can make adjustments—we’ll happily integrate your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>We could contract an objective third party to conduct additional tests. You could conduct your own tests with Palo Alto Networks and Orca Security’s products, then let the audience see and decide for themselves. All such actions would be far more beneficial to the industry, permitting both companies to learn and improve our products for the sake of customers.</p>
<p>As we all recently learned too well,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/sunlight-inactivates-the-airborne-virus-that-causes-covid19">sunlight is the best disinfectant</a>. The cybersecurity community deserves better than a vendor’s lack of transparency while wielding dubious legal methods. Palo Alto Networks is the worlds’ largest cybersecurity vendor; with great power comes great responsibility. Your products are great—but nothing is perfect, and the public should have free access to all of the facts.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
Avi Shua, CEO and Co-Founder<br>
Orca Security</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I find myself with a bit of excess time on my hands, now that I’m between jobs. Given that, I’ve found a few more challenging pedals to tear into and analyze.</p><p>First of these: the Boss GE-7 graphic equalizer pedal. This is a real standard, no-frills EQ pedal, and a real common selection among guitarists.</p><p>If you haven’t had a chance to look at the writeups for other pedals I’ve analyzed, those are available here:</p><ul><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-boss-ge7-equalizer/">Simulating the Boss GE-7 Graphic Equalizer in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-schaller-tremolo/">Simulating the Schaller Tremolo Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-dunlop-crybaby/">Simulating the Dunlop Crybaby Wah Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-proco-rat/">Simulating the ProCo RAT Distortion Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/posts/ltspice-tube-screamer/">Simulating the TS808 Tube Screamer in LTSpice</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Also!</em></strong> I’d love to help analyze a particular pedal you’re interested in learning about. Got a particular effect you know and love? Send me a schematic and I’ll see what I can do.</p><p>​</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, the LTSpice schematic, as per usual, is <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals">up on GitHub</a>. This time, I’d recommend you pull down a copy. This design is too big to show the whole thing in detail in one picture!</p><p>The GE-7 input stage is a AC coupled noninverting amplifier, set for 10x gain, and biased to a 4.5V operating point through R49. This bias is maintained at AC through C24 coupling to the 4.5V bias rail. Introduces a Zero into the circuit near 2.2kHz - high frequencies are <em>greatly</em> amplified</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The input amp here is nominally a Hitachi preamp circuit optimized for low input noise. I’m substituting an LT1211 here, as the precise part it’s not essential for understanding circuit function. I had suspected that maybe the HA1457W was a better performer on some audio parameter - THD, or perhaps input noise - but inspection of the datasheet shows that’s simply not the case. Even with a 12.5 [nV/rtHz] noise rating, the LT1211 measures out to an input voltage noise of 7.8 uVrms across a 2Hz - 22kHz bandwidth. On its worst day, even accounting for gain, that would still whip the HA1457W’s <em>typical</em> noise rating of 53uV.</p><p>I’d be curious to understand how this pedal measures out at -100dB A-weighted noise, but that’s a task for another day - one where I’ve got an AP and a spare EQ pedal handy.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020161132368.png" alt="GE-7 Input Buffer"></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I’m substituting the LT1211 here as a stand-in for the nominal uRC4558. I’ve done this before in the TS808 model with some success - the opamp isn’t doing anything special besides providing a high impedance input/low impedance output for subsequent stages.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603221036690.png" alt="GE-7 Volume Level Stage"></p><p>The level sweep is controlled by a low-corner RC filter (R3 + C2 with fc = 7.2Hz) connected to the center wiper of a potentiometer. Short the wiper to the Vol_Input node, and that lowpass filter shunts most of the energy at Vol_Input to GND.</p><p>Short the wiper in the opposite direction to the inverting opamp node, and something interesting happens. At signal frequencies (i.e. above 7.2Hz), the opamp starts to see a 5:1 divider formed by R54 and R3. The result of this is a ~15dB boost at the Vol_Level output.</p><p>Without this potentiometer, the GE-7 volume level stage is a pretty standard unity gain buffer. With the added RC filter on the potentiometer tap, however, it’s a cheap and easily controllable level stage.</p><h2 id="equalizer-summing-amp">Equalizer Summing Amp</h2><p>The equalizer stage starts with a relatively simple summing amplifier…</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020154212484.png" alt="image-20201020154212484"></p><h2 id="equalizer-bank-1">Equalizer Bank</h2><p>…but branches out rapidly into a rather large bank of Sallen-Key filters.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220690131.png" alt="Image"></p><p>We’ll zoom into the first of these Sallen-Key filters so we’re not trying to read from high altitude.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220733649.png" alt="Image"></p><p>A slightly less academic term for this topology of Sallen-Key filter is a <em>gyrator</em>. Gyrators are opamp circuits that simulate inductors. The following diagram is a really simple first-pass approximation of what this looks like. (I got lazy and didn’t connect the opamp rails. Sue me.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603221751243.png" alt="Gyrator Equivalent Circuit"></p><p>You’ll note that this RLC circuit forms a convenient little second-order bandpass filter. Adding another resistor to the input inverts this behavior, making it a <em>bandstop</em> or <em>notch filter.</em></p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020153829183.png" alt="Bandpass to Notch"></p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020153932147.png" alt="Frequency - Bandpass vs Notch"></p><p>Having taken that little detour into gyrators, we can apply what we know about this gyrator circuit with what we know about a linear pot shorting two terminals in an opamp buffer.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603222862594.png" alt="Image"></p><p>The connection to the linear potentiometer is easier to see with a little redraw, and some annotations. Look familiar?</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020154924404.png" alt="Redraw - RLC EQ with Summing Amp"></p><p>The idea here is that this is <em>basically the same circuit</em> as the input volume control. You’re just changing out the volume level’s first order RC wiper for the equalizer’s second order RLC wiper.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020155056333.png" alt="Equalizer vs Volume Level"></p><p>As a result, you get approximately the same behavior:</p><ul><li>Short the gyrator RLC to Eq_Input, and you cut that frequency bank by ~15dB</li><li>Short the gyrator RLC to Eq_Feedback, and you boost that frequency bank by ~15dB</li></ul><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020163611692.png" alt="Value Sweep - 100Hz Gyrator"></p><p>The steps above show the possible frequency cuts or boosts for the 100Hz EQ bank. The behavior is essentially the same for all of the other filter banks - they are just shifted in frequency to the center of the RLC circuit.</p><p>A valid question after all of this simulation rigamarole: why bother? Why not just get a regular old inductor instead of dealing with all of this gyrator nonsense?</p><p>It’s a good question. It wouldn’t be done this way unless there was a good reason to do so. Let’s look at the 200Hz gyrator notch for our answer:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603222814960.png" alt="Single Inductor"></p><p>The equivalent inductance here, from our earlier equation, is: \[L = R_{1} * R_{2} * C_{2} = 82[k\Omega ]*330[\Omega]*33[nF] = 0.89 [H]\]</p><p>An inductor rated to 0.89 Henries is a <em>huge</em> inductor, both in value and in physical size. Take, for example, the common mode chokes in any given AC/DC power supply. These are <em>big</em> inductors, typically rated in the tens of millihenries, and will easily occupy a 2 centimeter cube. I couldn’t even begin to estimate they physical size of an inductor that’s rated an order of magnitude higher than these. (I’ll leave that as an exercise to you, the reader, to find on DigiKey.)</p><p>In any case, a 2 cubic centimeter part is not gonna fly in an effects pedal. Remember - there are six of these circuits in the GE-7, which has an enclosure size of 13 cm by 7 cm by 5.5cm. I’d be surprised if you could get six inductors that size in the <em>box</em> - and, since we’re looking at the 200Hz notch, that’s not even the biggest inductor value in the design!</p><p>Besides size, you have to remember tolerance values. It’s hard to source big inductors with tighter tolerances than 20%. On the other hand, it’s easy (and cheap) to source 1% resistors and 5-10% capacitors. Correspondingly, it’s way easier to use those tighter-tolerance parts to yield a tighter-tolerance notch.</p><p>I’d also wager that, on net, it’s way cheaper to design with gyrators than with inductors. Chip vendors typically give price breaks at roughly logarithmic volumes. Thus, the faster you can buy 1k, 5k, or 10k pieces of a given silicon device, the cheaper your per-unit design becomes. That gets way easier when you’re buying multiple components per assembly. By using three dual TL022 opamps per design, it’s easier to get a scalable cost savings in your pedal designs. You only need to build ~350 GE-7s to achieve a cost savings from 1k volume pricing of TL022s. You’d likely need to sell a thousand pedals to get a price break from a similar inductor vendor - provided, of course, that those inductor vendors give pricing breaks at 1k volumes!</p><p>The bypass circuitry is a common design from Ibanez and Boss effects pedals.</p><h2 id="jfet-swithces">JFET Swithces</h2><p>A pair of JFETs AC coupled to the outputs of U2 (equalizer output) and U9 (the dry input signal) form the switch bank that determines whether the pedal output is Equalizer, or simply Bypass.</p><p>One channel is activated at a time by pulling either Effect_Gate or Bypass_Gate to GND. That shorts the corresponding output Bypass_Switch, and sends the audio signal to the output stage.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220859201.png" alt="Image"></p><p>Full disclosure: I typically cut out J2 and short Effect_Out to Bypass_Switch for the purposes of simulation. The reason? I’m lazy, and I haven’t taken the time to figure out a way to automatically disable the control circuitry in LTSpice when the sim starts up. I’d love to know a method for this if you have a trick up your sleeve.</p><h2 id="bistable-switch">Bistable Switch</h2><p>This is the control for JFETs J2/J3.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020163134819.png" alt="Bistable Switch"></p><p>It’s designed so that a specific startup sequence occurs when power is applied to the pedal:</p><ul><li>The base of Q1 is pulled up to V9P0 thru D1. This turns on Q1, pulling Effect_Gate low and shuts off J2.</li><li>Q1 turning on, in turn, pulls down the base of Q2. This shuts off Q2, pulling Bypass_Gate high.</li></ul><p>All this means is that, when power is applied, the pedal naturally comes up in Bypass mode. You have to trigger the switch to turn the equalizer on.</p><p>Full disclosure: I don’t know a great way to have this trigger Sw_Activate in the simulation startup. Like I said in the previous section, I typically cut out the JFETs when simulating. I’d love to spend a little time analyzing the click/pop of that circuit switchover once I figure out a good way to do so.</p><p>The output buffer is a bog-standard AC coupled emitter follower, of the kind we’ve come to know and love. R63 + C31 + R62 form a lowpass filter with fc = 2.2kHz. This forms a pole that compensates the zero at 2.2kHz from the input stage, flattening the pedal’s frequency response above 2.2kHz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020164430482.png" alt="GE-7 Output Buffer"></p><p>The <a href="https://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/s/ge7-equalizer.php">Hobby Hour Schematics page</a> has a big list of effects pedals that I’ve been sourcing schematics from. I used that page as a reference for this schematic design and its component part numbers.</p><p>I also had a look in my copy of Douglas Self’s <em>Small Signal Audio Design</em> for a good explanation of graphic EQ circuits. If you’ve got a copy laying around, it’s on pages 447-450 of the Second Edition.</p><p>If you don’t have a copy of Self’s book, you can always have a look at Rod Elliot’s page on <a href="https://sound-au.com/articles/gyrator-filters.htm">active filters using gyrators</a>. It’s an epic and thorough read on the topic.</p><p>Further reference for AC coupling Sallen Key filters (a.k.a. gyrators) was taken from TI’s app note, <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa096/sloa096.pdf">More Filter Design on a Budget</a>. A handy reference for the cheapskate audio hobbyist, along with <a href="https://nanopdf.com/download/filter-design-on-a-budget_pdf">its predecessor</a> (served here by NanoPDF, as apparently the original was taken down by TI).</p><p>The Geofex forum also has a great description of <a href="http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/bosstech.pdf">the dry/effect chain switching in Ibanez and Boss …</a></p></div></div>

<p>I’ve been in and around eng hiring for the past 13 years, as an engineer, a recruiter, and a founder of a technical recruiting marketplace (interviewing.io). Over the course of those 13 years, I’ve become increasingly disgruntled at the state of hiring, and now I’m mad enough to write this blog post.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever been on either end of the table, you’re probably mad at the state of hiring, too. Whether you have given it a lot of thought or whether you just feel it deep down, something about the whole process feels off.</p>



<p>But we’ve been doing it this way for so long that we probably take much of how hiring works as gospel, and it’s really hard to tease apart all the different components of the process and examine why they are the way they are. In this post, I’d like to challenge many of the things we assume about hiring, and, perhaps most importantly, I’d like to lay out my platonic ideal for how eng hiring should work. It’s a simple axiom, really:</p>



<p><em>It should be easy for smart people to talk to other smart people.</em></p>



<p>Or, another way to put it … if I’m a good engineer, it should be easy for me to talk to a hiring manager at a company I might be interested in, at a time of my choosing. But that’s simply not possible today. Despite the refrain that we’re in a candidate’s market and that there’s a shortage of good candidates, which should mean that candidates should have the power to call the shots, today’s hiring process couldn’t be further removed from this ideal. And it’s not just broken for a specific type of candidate. It’s broken for <em>everyone.</em></p>



<p>If you’re reading this, you might be an engineering manager, a senior engineer with stellar credentials, a recent bootcamp grad, an engineer from a background traditionally underrepresented in tech, or some combination of these. <strong>What’s truly messed up about the status quo is that, regardless of which of these groups you fall into, your journey will be unnecessarily unpleasant. Though the degree of unpleasantness will not always be the same, it’s not about race, seniority, pedigree, or gender … or even which side of the table you’re on. Hiring, in its current incarnation, is broken for everybody.</strong></p>



<p>Why? Let us go then, you and I, into the bowels of the status quo.</p>



<h2>A candidate and a hiring manager, never the twain shall meet</h2>



<p>Let’s say that I’m a competent generalist engineer who looks good on paper, and I’m thinking that it’s time to look for a new job. What happens next? The idea of having to mount a full-on job search is so daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could try some job boards to see which companies are out there. But what would I filter on? I know a lot of programming languages but am not set on having to work in a specific one. How can I tell if I’ll hit it off with the team? I’m applying via a job board to a position I know next to nothing about — will anyone even respond?</p>



<p>Suppose I find some companies where I might want to work. If I’m lucky enough to know someone there, I’ll have to get them to refer me, even though that may not actually do much to speed things along. And if I don’t know anyone there, applying will be an exhausting long shot. Odds are no one will look at my application, and having to redo my resume — or worse, write cover letters — seems like the most tedious kind of busywork.</p>



<p>I guess I can always dig through the recruiter spam I’ve gotten. But do those recruiters still work at the company? If they do, how long will it actually take to get into the process?</p>



<p>Breaking character for a moment, a friend of mine recently got this recruiting email from Google, who has elevated gaslighting to an art form: somehow the fact that it takes two months to get through their process has become a <em>selling point.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="319" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-450x191.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-768x327.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Once I do get into the process, why do I have to endure the same intro call ten times with different recruiters who can’t tell me anything about what I’d be working on at any level of depth?</p>



<p>Do I join some platform, create a profile that I copy-paste everywhere (with writing that was just as painful as the aforementioned resume/cover letter) and sort of hope that decent companies contact me … only to have to begin the same recruiter calls over and over again, as above?</p>



<p>Will I have to take some quizzes that drill me on obscure syntax or make me solve toy problems that have no bearing on my engineering ability before I even get to have the aforementioned inane conversation with a recruiter?</p>



<p><strong>If I’m actually good at my job, why can’t I just set up some conversations with companies I think are cool and see if it’s a fit? Why do I have to subject myself and others to an endless parade of vapid conversations and the inevitable busywork that precedes them?</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the truth. Even if I look good on paper and am well-connected, hiring still sucks because of all the noise, uncertainty, and time wasted … but at least I have options. They might not be exactly the right options for me, but at least they exist. On the other hand, if I’m an engineer without a pedigree or a network, my choices are extremely limited, no matter how good I am. Recruiters aren’t reaching out to me, I’m not well-networked enough to have friends refer me, and I <em>definitely </em>don’t hear back when I apply.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s take a look at the other side of the table. Let’s say I’m an eng manager who needs to hire more competent generalists for my team. Having worked as both an eng manager and a recruiter, I can tell you that what happens next isn’t particularly inspiring.</p>



<p>As an eng manager, I sit down with a recruiter and try to explain what I’m looking for. Nine times out of ten, I want a <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">smart person who can get shit done</a>. But, after a farcical game of telephone, somehow those criteria get warped into years of experience with a specific technology or requirements about where the candidate went to school. I also end up with an uninspired, sterile job description that fails to capture the imagination of any candidates who might unwittingly stumble upon it.</p>



<p><strong>My recruiter then goes to any number of sourcing tools of which LinkedIn Recruiter is the ubiquitous, lackluster market leader. They type in keywords I didn’t ask for and filter on credentials I don’t care about to come up with the same homogenous list of candidates every other recruiter at every other tech company is chasing.</strong></p>



<p>They then contact these candidates en masse with generic copy about my team and the hard problems we’re solving. They celebrate single-digit response rates and spend the minimal time left over to give a cursory glance at candidates applying directly.</p>



<h2>Why is hiring broken?</h2>



<p>So therein lies the ineffectual dance. This is the process we’ve come to accept. As far as I can tease out, the axioms that underlie today’s recruiting best practices go something like this (some of these were told to me verbatim when I was starting out as a recruiter, even):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Thou shalt not engage with active candidates. After all, in this market, strong candidates aren’t looking. Good recruiters build relationships so that when a good candidate does decide to enter the market, the recruiter is there, behind the next doorway, ready to spring!</strong></li><li><strong>Engineering time is expensive, so it’s critical to do as much top-of-funnel filtering as possible to make sure that it’s spent on the right candidates.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Are these axioms wrong? The sad truth is … not really. I’ve written in a <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/the-unvarnished-unbundled-guide-to-hiring-tools/">previous post about how market forces rule everything around me</a>, and recruiting best practices are no exception. In an economy with a surplus of jobs and a shortage of talent, it follows that the best talent is going to be harder to find, engineering time will be expensive, and recruiters in their current incarnation are, dare I say it, a necessary evil. <sup><a href="#footnote_0_2455" id="identifier_0_2455" title="From what you’ve read up until this point, you might think that I hate recruiters and find them useless. Not so, dear reader! I hate bad recruiters. And, unfortunately, most of them are bad. What’s sad is that the good ones, instead of spending time on tasks for which they’re uniquely qualified and well-suited, are instead stuck at the top of the funnel sourcing engineers whose qualifications they don’t have the domain expertise to evaluate and selling them on roles they don’t have the domain expertise to describe. The best recruiters I’ve worked with are singularly amazing at shepherding candidates through the process, tirelessly stewarding a company’s employer brand, advising hiring managers on the best ways to close, keeping an analytical eye on the funnel to identify issues before they even arise, and much more.">1</a></sup></p>



<p>The data supports our current world view. According to Lever (one of the two application tracking systems widely used by startups, Greenhouse is the other), here’s a breakdown of how many candidates from each source it takes to make a hire. Note that here, larger numbers are bad — for many companies, internal referrals are the best source and inbound applications are the worst.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-450x225.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-768x384.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at this data, you can see why recruiters simply ignore online applications. The same dynamics also apply to platforms such as AngelList — like any jobs board, it’s noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage (e.g., juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship).</p>



<p>As for the value of eng time, guarding it carefully isn’t exactly wrong either. In fact, if you look at what a typical hiring process looks like today, you’ll see that most of the time spent is by engineers conducting interviews.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hiring process stage</strong></th><th>Who does it?</th><th>How long does it take?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resume review</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>10-30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Recruiter screen</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>45 min</td></tr><tr><td>Technical phone screen</td><td>Engineer</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Eng portion</td><td>Engineer</td><td>6 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Recruiter portion</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Offer</td><td>Recruiter OR Eng mgr</td><td>1 hour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Engineering salaries are high, so given that most of the time spent on a single candidate is with engineers, it’s <em>rational</em> to put some recruiter gates at the top of the funnel to protect eng time. The idea is that recruiters will effectively screen out most candidates and only pass on the most promising ones to the eng team.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when you look at an actual typical <em>funnel</em>, you’ll see that despite attempts to gate the top with recruiters filtering resumes and making intro calls, it’s not really working. Below is what a typical funnel looks like.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

<p>Welcome to the fortieth issue of <a href="https://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> News.</p>

<p>Racket is in an exciting place and there was no place better to see that than in the community that joined Gather last weekend for RacketCon 2020. Due to the global pandemic, we did not manage to get together in-person but we still spent some time together discussing all things Racket and socializing in Gather’s virtual environment. This issue is packed with information including links to videos for all the talks in RacketCon. I can’t wait to see what next year will bring us - hope you are excited as I am.</p>

<p>Grab an espresso and enjoy!</p>

<p>Want to contribute to Racket? Don’t know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.</p>

<p>This week I (happily) had my plans squashed by our last “Call to Racket” champion <code>xxyzz</code>. I created issue <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3446">#3446</a> for this issue’s “Call to Racket” but before I could press “Publish” on this issue, <code>xxyzz</code> created PR <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3447">#3447</a> to fix it (way to go <code>xxyzz</code> - thanks for the fix). Therefore I will once again issue a call to fix <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3161">issue 3161</a>. If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>





<p>This week’s project in the spotlight is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/index.html">Plot</a> by Neil Toronto, currently maintained by Alex Harsányi.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The Plot library provides a flexible interface for producing nearly any kind of plot. It includes many common kinds of plots already, such as scatter plots, line plots, contour plots, histograms, and 3D surfaces and isosurfaces. Thanks to Racket’s excellent multiple-backend drawing library, Plot can render plots as interactive snips in DrRacket, as picts in slideshows, as PNG, PDF, PS and SVG files, or on any device context.</p></blockquote>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ogGwX9bJH9ZvccFjvTWpZFY757T1z5Gr/view?usp=sharing">Corpse Reviver: Sound and Efficient Gradual Typing via Contract Verification</a> by Cameron Moy, Phúc C. Nguyễn, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and David van Horn.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Gradually-typed programming languages permit the incremental addition of static types to untyped programs. To remain sound, languages insert run-time checks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. Unfortunately, performance studies have shown that the overhead of these checks can be disastrously high, calling into question the viability of sound gradual typing. In this paper, we show that by building on existing work on soft contract verification, we can reduce or eliminate this overhead. Our key insight is that while untyped code cannot be trusted by a gradual type system, there is no need to consider only the worst case when optimizing a gradually-typed program. Instead, we statically analyze the untyped portions of a gradually-typed program to prove that almost all of the dynamic checks implied by gradual type boundaries cannot fail, and can be eliminated at compile time. Our analysis is modular, and can be applied to any portion of a program. We evaluate this approach on a dozen existing gradually-typed programs previously shown to have prohibitive performance overhead — with a median overhead of 3.5x and up to 73.6x in the worst case — and eliminate all overhead in most cases, suffering only 1.6x overhead in the worst case.</p></blockquote>

          <p>If you’re like me, when you start coding something new, you’re probably finding yourself working with JSON.  Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point.  Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days.  There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…</p>

<p>To double-click on that, the problem isn’t the JSON data format itself, although Cassandra doesn’t make JSON easy, it’s the way most devs use JSON when we’re building our apps.  Iterative development means that plans change.  The user registration form now needs a couple of more fields and the front-end dev went ahead and added them.  That API I’m calling returns some extra data.   Welcome to the loosely coupled world, it’s all fun and games until my app needs to send it to the database.</p>

<p>In the early days, Cassandra actually made this pretty simple to do, but as the project matured and added features like enterprise-friendly SQL-like query languages and better indexing, that meant that we needed the database to enforce a schema.  Over time, it became harder and harder to use Cassandra for things like JSON and other document-oriented use cases.</p>

<p>Enter Stargate - if there’s one thing you should know about the Stargate team it’s that our personal mission is to make Cassandra easy for every developer.  Figuring out how to give Javascript devs native JSON support without having to give up any of the reliability and scalability goodness of Cassandra was a challenge we couldn’t pass up.</p>

<p>This idea gave rise to the Stargate <strong>Documents API</strong>, which lets most Cassandra distros (Cassandra 3.11, Cassandra 4.0, and DataStax Enterprise 6.8), work with JSON through a REST API.</p>

<h2 id="api-features-and-design">API features and design</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/tjake">Jake Luciani</a> and I started to create the bones of this API, we realized that Cassandra is nothing like a document store. Expressing data as rows is straightforward, but expressing trees of JSON data is really not. In addition, mapping that JSON data onto a table managed by Stargate and keeping both writes and reads reasonably fast adds an additional layer of complexity.</p>

<p>From here, we mapped out three main design components in order for this work:
Modeling Documents in Cassandra
Handling Reads and Writes
Figuring out Deletes</p>

<p>The rest of this blog walks through how we approached each design and resolved some hiccups along the way.
Modeling Documents in Cassandra with Document Shredding</p>

<p>The first thing that we had to decide  was the schema of the managed table that backs a document collection. Due to some great discussions with some Cassandra specialists, it was decided that when a user creates a document, a table will be created with a statement of the form:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>key</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>p0</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>…</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>N</span><span>]</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>bool_value</span> <span>boolean</span><span>,</span>
  <span>txt_value</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span>
  <span>bl_value</span> <span>double</span><span>,</span> <span>leaf</span> <span>text</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point is where we had to solve an unbounded data modeling problem. Because any JSON document that has a depth of [N] or less can be added to this table, each value in the JSON will get stored as a row in the table. So if I wanted to represent a document called “x” that has the JSON:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The document would be “shredded” into rows looking like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For data with an array, such as:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>"d"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>there would be two rows, like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>[0]</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Array elements are stored with square braces in the column.</p>

<h3 id="handling-reads-and-writes">Handling Reads and Writes</h3>

<p>The next problem that arose was that naïvely, updates to a document could require reading the document from the database, seeing what modification would have to be made, and then writing the updated data.  This “read-before-write” process is a notorious source of performance and consistency issues in most data stores.</p>

<p>Therefore, we resolved to avoid doing any read-before-write operations at all costs.</p>

<p>An interesting implementation detail that came up is that when you write some data to a document, the resulting write operation is just a simple batch with some inserts and deletes. In some cases, this can cause the document rows in the database to show two different states for the same JSON field.</p>

<p><em>And, upon reading the rows out, the Documents API reconciles conflicting information by accepting the data that has a later Cassandra write time (much like Cassandra itself!).</em></p>

<p>This allows us to write data really quickly while not compromising too much in reads either, as the reconciliation does not happen often and is also quite fast. It also gives us a very important core principle to our basic write and read operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every write to a single document is a single batch of statements, and</li>
  <li>Every read from a single document is a single SELECT statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>So writes and reads are squared away - but what about deletes?</p>

<h3 id="figuring-out-deletes">Figuring out Deletes</h3>

<p>Because of the distributed nature of the database, a deletion in Cassandra actually is very similar to an insert, but instead a “tombstone” is written at a particular write time to signify the death of a row.</p>

<p>Rest in peace… almost</p>

<p>One very real danger here is that Cassandra may eventually crash with a “Tombstone Overwhelming” error as tombstones accrue. Cassandra periodically (the frequency here depends on your compaction strategy and/or cluster load) does a compaction operation to remove tombstones and alleviate this pressure, so the only way to avoid overwhelming Cassandra is to make sure that the frequency of deletions is low enough.</p>

<p>This poses a problem for the Document API specifically because of arrays. Let’s walk through this one.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have an array at some key that is of length 100000. If you then issue a replace operation (via a PUT) and decide to replace that array with some other value, then all of those 100000 rows would be deleted, causing 100000 tombstones to be written.  This is an enormous number of tombstones to be written in one operation, and if you do that just a few more times, Cassandra will likely crash or get super slow. So the structure of the data in each table needed one last major modification.</p>

<p>We said before that array paths are stored in the database with square brackets; for example the element at index 0 would be stored as [0]. That would mean a deletion of 100000 elements would look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'[0]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[1]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[2]'</span><span>,</span> <span>…</span><span>,</span> <span>'[99999]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Causing 100000 tombstones to be written. Instead of doing that, we decided to pad all array elements with leading zeros, so the element at index 0 would instead be represented as [000000], and the element at index 99999 would be [099999]. Doing this allowed us to change the deletion statement to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>'[000000]'</span> <span>and</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>'[999999]'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Which causes only a single so-called “range” tombstone to be written, instead of 100000 cell tombstones (note that greater and less than works on strings in Cassandra and will compare lexically). It also relaxes the array length limit to one million elements, which is pretty neat! The time series below shows how the old vs. new implementation might behave, if you performed compactions every week:</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png"></p>

<p>So the new strategy is just safer for deletions; it would require an incredibly large amount of deletion with the new strategy to even come close to the theoretical tombstone limits!</p>

<h2 id="preliminary-look-at-api-performance">Preliminary Look at API performance</h2>

<p>⚠️ Before starting on this section, we want to mention that benchmarking is a great tool, but does not necessarily represent how a system will behave under real load, out in the wild. We also haven’t done comparisons on the same hardware with other document stores…yet. Alright, let’s get to it!</p>

<p>In order to test that the Document API is reasonably fast, we ran a benchmark test using a single Cassandra storage node and a single Stargate node (Stargate is the API that contains the Documents API). We then ran two different benchmarks, one that uses HTTP GET to repeatedly get random paths in a document, and another that performs HTTP POSTs repeatedly to create brand new documents.  Each of these actions got run 100000 times, and here are two graphs of the results.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, as there is no baseline to compare things against just yet, the benchmark was performed using only one requester at a time, with light concurrency (10 users at once), and with more concurrency (100 users at once). Note that it’s expected with only one backend node that higher concurrency would cause degradation in performance; you should have multiple nodes to service that degree of concurrent requests!</p>

<p>Here are the results for reads:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1 user:</th>
      <th>10 users:</th>
      <th>100 users:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_1_User.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_1_User.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_10_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_10_Users.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_100_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_100_Users.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And for writes:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1 user:</th>
      <th>10 users:</th>
      <th>100 users:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_1_User.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_1_User.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_10_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_10_Users.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_100_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_100_Users.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>From the above, we can see that the API performs pretty well at a reasonable level of concurrency for our setup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s to the accidental security engineers. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>

  <p>To every engineer who’s ever spent a day scratching their head, wondering how to comply with a new security policy.</p>

  <p>To all those lost sprints building annoying primitives that “<em>have</em> to exist somewhere already”.</p>

  <p>To all the stressful weeks of getting pulled off new features to help prepare for an audit.</p>

  <p>To every web app, Slack bot, CLI, and microservice that was hacked together to help roll out a new control, only to become a pain-in-the-ass to maintain.</p>

  <p>It was us. We’ve been the ones tasked with building this mess. Constantly trading off velocity and security. But no more. We’re going to solve this problem, together, once and for all.</p>

  <p>Enter: Sym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hello-sym">Hello, Sym</h2>

<p>Sym is the security workflow platform made for engineers, by engineers. We solve the intent-to-execution gap between policies and workflows by providing fast-moving engineering teams with the just-right primitives to roll out best-practice controls.</p>

<p>Our hand-crafted Terraform templates let you easily provision instances of common security controls, while our Python SDK unlocks ridiculously simple customization to meet your team’s needs and integrate with existing tools. We’ve got our sights set on fixing the “Build vs Buy” problem with security workflows… the problem being that both options currently suck.</p>

<p>I’m overjoyed and humbled to share that we’re not embarking on this quest alone. We’re off to the races with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">$9M Series A led by Sunil Dhaliwal at Amplify Partners</a>, following hot on the heels of a $3M Seed led by Robin Vasan at Mango Capital and Andy McLoughlin at Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>They say “never meet your heroes”, but with participation from security &amp; technology executives at GitHub, Datadog, Atlassian, Google, Bugsnag, and Segment, alongside early design partners like LaunchDarkly, we’re sure glad we met ours!</p>

<p>We’re excited to unveil our vision to the world, and announce that we’ve partnered with some of the best investors, engineers, and leaders in the industry to tackle this mountainous problem space. Every single person behind Sym has experienced our struggle first-hand (phew, we’re not crazy!), and won’t rest until we solve it. Let’s do this!</p>

<h2 id="howd-we-get-here">How’d we get here?</h2>

<p>Story time! I met Adam and Jon when I was a freshman at MIT. I distinctly remember walking into the Startup Career Fair wondering how I could circumvent the “no freshmen” rule most companies seemed to have when hiring interns. A friendly senior had let me know to watch out for the scores that recruiters would scrawl on resumes before haphazardly throwing them on the pile. A week prior, I watched a Facebook recruiter scratch a “1” onto mine, circling the sad number repeatedly before smiling and telling me to have a nice day. My world fell apart. This week was going to be different.</p>

<p>After having a great chat with this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev">Vlad</a> (Robinhood wasn’t a Big Deal yet), I ran into Adam. He was the VP of Engineering at a Boston-based company called Localytics, and seemed as relieved as I was to be having a conversation. I hesitantly bought into his pitch, and scheduled a time to come onsite. Little did I know, that thoughtless commitment would totally change the trajectory of my life, and one day be responsible for the founding of Sym!</p>

<p>The first meeting was uneventful, or so I thought. I showed up 30 minutes late to a rather exasperated Adam lecturing me on the demerits of interview tardiness. Throughout the years, I’ve grown very accustomed to that frustrated expression 😅. Though I’m still notoriously late for most things in life, I’ve never again failed to be punctual for a job interview!</p>

<p>Against his better judgement, Adam brought me on as an early intern at Localytics. It was my first job, and he was my first boss. I learned the ropes (read: how to ignore everyone’s advice while minimally pissing them off), and got to collaborate on some <a href="https://eng.localytics.com/your-code-coverage-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/">really fun projects</a>. Jon (our third cofounder) spent a lot of time reprimanding me.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the summer <del>fighting</del> working together, and ended with a particularly controversial project where, against the better judgement of basically everyone, I pumped out a heap of flaky Javascript code for saving reports, and then peaced out from the company ✌️.</p>

<p>I’m extremely grateful that over the span of a decade, I stayed in touch with these two. Our relationship evolved, from manager-intern, to mentor-mentee, to peers, to cofounders. When I stepped away from my last company to start Sym, those two were my first call. And boy, am I glad they were.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e009c90866e63034acc943efabdfa4a6457078d7/c6517/assets/hello-sym/map.png" alt="Map"></p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-sym">Evolution of Sym</h2>

<p>When Jon, Adam, and I sat down to build Sym, we wanted to solve a very simple problem: every engineering org we know in a heavily-regulated space was building the same damn tooling. Coming from healthcare and enterprise SaaS, we’d seen permutations of the same few workflows time and time again throughout our careers. A way to grant engineers temporary access to infrastructure? Check. A way to approve one-off queries? Check. Something to make quarterly risk assessments suck less? Check. Chat-Ops for approving outgoing deploys? Check.</p>

<p>The crazy thing was, these seemed to be ubiquitous across companies, compliance standards, even industries. Chatting with fellow founders about stuff I’d built to help keep my team productive would always result in one of two reactions: “<em>oh yea, we built the same thing! let’s trade notes…“</em>, or <em>“oh shit, we should have built this years ago”</em>. So we came up with a crazy idea: what if we just build all this stuff once, and put it out in the world for everyone to use. We were going to start with HIPAA-induced workflows. Sym: HIPAA in a box, for engineers. Of course, things rarely work out that simply.</p>

<p>We rapidly discovered something while talking to potential users: our hypothesis that everyone is building tools for the same workflows was a bit off. It wasn’t the case that everyone’s workflows were identical, but instead that they had the same <em>shared core</em>. It turns out, what most teams do is they start by building the same <strong>primitives</strong>, and then they layer on <strong>customizations</strong> that reflect existing processes and tools. So, we adjusted our approach to match this revelation.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dc4f6494be10e2dfb90dc745bd96e83fffad695e/7aa7d/assets/hello-sym/graph.gif" alt="Graph"></p>

<p>Today, Sym is a set of workflow templates (<strong>primitives</strong>) for engineering teams working on improving security posture, and a suite of integrations (<strong>customizations</strong>) that connect those templates to existing systems and policies. Our mission is to enable any team to effortlessly build unobtrusive security and governance workflows, so we make sure to meet developers where they are: our primitives are exposed as Infrastructure-as-Code, and our SDK captures last-mile variance in workflows. The tools we use to distribute Sym Workflows are Terraform and Python, but your organization doesn’t have to be familiar with either to use us.</p>

<p>With Sym, you can roll out many common security and governance workflows with ~30 lines of declarative config and a couple function body definitions. Our goal is for you to blow your InfoSec team away; bring speed, sophistication, and thoroughness to your controls, without losing a whole month each time. Beautiful dashboards with just-right reports will materialize, without a single tedious line of logging code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b56882478ed2e08f51d3f70075e993d385a2eef/193db/assets/hello-sym/code.png" alt="Code"></p>

<p>We’re currently live (in production!) at a handful of public and private companies in the Healthcare and B2B SaaS spaces. Our initial workflows focus on governance and just-in-time access of cloud and app-level resources.</p>

<p>Our latest customer is locking down SSH access by rolling out <a href="https://compliance.dev/2020/03/23/aws-session-manager-ssh-tunnels-with-less-user-management/">AWS Session Manager tunnels</a> as the preferred way to connect to instances, with the IAM Role required to use SSM protected by Sym. This is one of many examples where we’re able to help infra teams adopt cutting-edge cloud offerings while increasing security posture. If this sounds like something that you’d like for your team, please <a href="https://symops.com/">reach out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-x">But what about X?</h2>

<p>We’re in a crowded space! Luckily, we see the world with a unique lens. Sym brings an emphasis on developer experience, opinionated workflows that codify best practices, and an aspiration to be the bridge between Security and Compliance. The jury’s still out on whether we’re totally brilliant or totally out to lunch.</p>

<p>Our vision at Sym is to become the de-facto standard for implementing and showcasing security posture. Importantly, we’re not setting out to be a middleman levying a tax on the system. We saw enough of those in our healthcare days. Instead, we’re striving to improve the status quo for every stakeholder in the security equation; our place as the obvious-choice bridge between security and compliance will be an emergent property of the system we’re fighting to improve.</p>

<p>We’ve got a long way to go to make that vision a reality. In the interim, we’re tackling several problems plaguing our friends and colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="security-intent-to-implementation-gap">Security intent-to-implementation gap</h3>

<p>A security intent-to-implementation gap is endemic in our industry today. Experts are laying out guidelines, policies, and best-practices, only to be foiled by the gargantuan effort required to implement workflows that reflect these intents. And to be honest, we can’t really blame engineering teams for this. As an industry, we’ve learned not to roll our own crypto, because it’s so easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but can you imagine how many ways there are to screw up a Slack bot that issues temporary database credentials? Or how easy it is to forget to put MFA around an admin God-mode dashboard? Twitter hack, anyone?</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        <p>Football (or soccer to my American readers) is full of clichés: “It’s a game of two halves”, “taking it one game at a time” and “Liverpool have failed to win the Premier League”. You’re less likely to hear “Treating the number of goals scored by each team as independent Poisson processes, statistical modelling suggests that the home team have a 60% chance of winning today”. But this is actually a bit of cliché too (it has been discussed <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution">here</a>, <a href="https://help.smarkets.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001457989-How-to-calculate-Poisson-distribution-for-football-betting">here</a>, <a href="http://pena.lt/y/2014/11/02/predicting-football-using-r/">here</a>, <a href="http://opisthokonta.net/?p=296">here</a> and <a href="https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/football/r/predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling/">particularly well here</a>). As we’ll discover, a simple Poisson model is, well, overly simplistic. But it’s a good starting point and a nice intuitive way to learn about statistical modelling. So, if you came here looking to make money, <a href="http://www.make5000poundspermonth.co.uk/">I hear this guy makes £5000 per month without leaving the house</a>.</p>

<h2 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson Distribution</h2>

<p>The model is founded on the number of goals scored/conceded by each team. Teams that have been higher scorers in the past have a greater likelihood of scoring goals in the future. We’ll import all match results from the recently concluded Premier League (2016/17) season. There’s various sources for this data out there (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">kaggle</a>, <a href="http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php">football-data.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata">github</a>, <a href="http://api.football-data.org/index">API</a>). I built an <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/footballR">R wrapper for that API</a>, but I’ll go the csv route this time around.</p>

<p>We imported a csv as a pandas dataframe, which contains various information for each of the 380 EPL games in the 2016-17 English Premier League season. We restricted the dataframe to the columns in which we’re interested (specifically, team names and numer of goals scored by each team). I’ll omit most of the code that produces the graphs in this post. But don’t worry, you can find that code on <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/blogScripts/blob/master/Jupyter/2017-06-04-predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling.ipynb">my github page</a>. Our task is to model the final round of fixtures in the season, so we must remove the last 10 rows (each gameweek consists of 10 matches).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>epl_1617</span> <span>=</span> <span>epl_1617</span><span>[:</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>

<div><div><pre><code>HomeGoals    1.591892

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll notice that, on average, the home team scores more goals than the away team. This is the so called ‘home (field) advantage’ (discussed <a href="https://jogall.github.io/2017-05-12-home-away-pref/">here</a>) and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1803416-is-home-field-advantage-as-important-in-baseball-as-other-major-sports">isn’t specific to soccer</a>. This is a convenient time to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. It’s a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of the number of events within a specific time period (e.g 90 mins) with a known average rate of occurrence. A key assumption is that the number of events is independent of time. In our context, this means that goals don’t become more/less likely by the number of goals already scored in the match. Instead, the number of goals is expressed purely as function an average rate of goals. If that was unclear, maybe this mathematical formulation will make clearer:</p>



<p> represents the average rate (e.g. average number of goals, average number of letters you receive, etc.). So, we can treat the number of goals scored by the home and away team as two independent Poisson distributions. The plot below shows the proportion of goals scored compared to the number of goals estimated by the corresponding Poisson distributions.</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/home_away_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can use this statistical model to estimate the probability of specfic events.</p>



<p>The probability of a draw is simply the sum of the events where the two teams score the same amount of goals.</p>



<p>Note that we consider the number of goals scored by each team to be independent events (i.e. P(A n B) = P(A) P(B)). The difference of two Poisson distribution is actually called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellam_distribution">Skellam distribution</a>. So we can calculate the probability of a draw by inputting the mean goal values into this distribution.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of draw between home and away team</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of home team winning by one goal</span>
<span>skellam</span><span>.</span><span>pmf</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/skellam_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, hopefully you can see how we can adapt this approach to model specific matches. We just need to know the average number of goals scored by each team and feed this data into a Poisson model. Let’s have a look at the distribution of goals scored by Chelsea and Sunderland (teams who finished 1st and last, respectively).</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/chelsea_sunderland_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="building-a-model">Building A Model</h2>

<p>You should now be convinced that the number of goals scored by each team can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. Due to a relatively sample size (each team plays at most 19 home/away games), the accuracy of this approximation can vary significantly (especially earlier in the season when teams have played fewer games). Similar to before, we could now calculate the probability of various events in this Chelsea Sunderland match. But rather than treat each match separately, we’ll build a more general Poisson regression model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression">what is that?</a>).</p>

						<p>Science has two stark problems: replication and innovation. Many scientific findings aren’t reproducible. That is to say, you can’t be sure that another study or experiment on the same question would get similar results. At the same time, the pace of scientific innovation could be slowing down.</p>
<p>Does attempting to solve one problem make the other worse? Many have argued that policies seeking to avoid reproducibility issues will create a constrictive atmosphere that inhibits innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, top policymakers are worried about just this. Along with other prominent philanthropists and academics, I attended a White House meeting on scientific reproducibility early in 2020 (just before COVID-19 really hit). One of the key questions on a sheet of paper that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy circulated for discussion was whether a tradeoff existed: Would efforts to improve reproducibility risk harming the creativity and innovation of federally-funded research?</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> think there’s a contradiction between reproducibility and innovation. Contrary to common belief, we can improve <i>both</i> at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.</p>
<p>First, though, let’s take a step back, and briefly review the evidence that significant areas of science could be more reproducible and innovative.</p>
<h2><b>Is science reproducible?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>Many people have written about scientific irreproducibility over the past several decades. But the issue became more prominent in the mid-2000s with the publication of what soon became one of the most downloaded research papers of all time: The 2005 piece “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>,” by Stanford’s John Ioannidis. (Disclaimer: he is a long-time grantee of Arnold Ventures, where I work.)</p>
<p>To be sure, Ioannidis’s finding was mostly theoretical; it’s not as if he actually redid “most” published research (i.e., tens of millions of studies). Instead, he showed that given the way most studies are carried out, if journals have even a slight bias towards positive results (and they most definitely do), then most of the results that end up getting published would inevitably be statistical flukes or the results of p-hacking.</p>
<p>His theoretical case has been confirmed by many empirical studies in fields from drug development to psychology. Pharmaceutical companies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> have reported that they are unable to reproduce 80+% of experiments from prestigious journals. To quote Bayer’s scientists, “projects that were started in our company based on exciting published data have often resulted in disillusionment when key data could not be reproduced.”</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project in Psychology</a>, which we funded, and which was carried out by our grantee Center for Open Science. That project organized well over 200 psychology labs around the world to systematically redo 100 experiments published in top psychology journals. It found that only about 40% could be reliably replicated (another 40% were inconclusive, and around 20% were decisively <i>not</i> replicated). Since <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">those results were published</a> in 2015, the study has already been cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10200793109432081889&amp;as_sdt=5,44&amp;sciodt=0,44&amp;hl=en">over 4,400 times</a> according to Google Scholar. Many of the most famous results in psychology have turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">unreliable</a> and possibly fraudulent (such as Zimbardo’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford prison experiment</a>), and the best recent treatment of this issue is Stuart Ritchie’s 2020 book “Science Fictions.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper-MacCounPerlmutter2017ch15.pdf">blinding researchers</a> to their own conclusions. The bulk of the reproducibility and publication bias problem seems to be in social science and biomedicine. In many of those fields and subfields – such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160345/">clinical trials in medicine</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1092.pdf">high-throughput bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000090">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661314000540">cognitive science</a>, <a href="https://www.niss.org/publications/deming-data-and-observational-studies-process-out-control-and-needing-fixing">public health and epidemiological research</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12032">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-fault-in-our-stars-%3A-Measuring-and-correcting-Esarey-Wu/48403d5dce1f2972c7a91af3bb2d41635221cb3f">political science</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23696308/">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1019294">education</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124108318973">sociology</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/">computer science</a>, and <a href="https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/">machine learning and AI</a> – the published literature features too many false positives as well as conclusions that may well be p-hacked. It’s enough to make folks at the White House, NIH, and NSF worried about the quality of federally-funded science.</p>
<h2><b>Is science innovative enough?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>At the same time, numerous observers have pointed to an entirely different problem: science has grown less innovative these days. (And even if it hasn’t, we could always benefit from faster innovation.)</p>
<p>In a recent piece, Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, and Michael Nielsen, a theoretical physicist, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">made the case</a> that the rate of scientific advancement is slowing down in recent years per dollar spent. Based on surveys of noted leaders in physics, chemistry, and medicine, they concluded, “Over the past century, we’ve vastly increased the time and money invested in science, but in scientists’ own judgement, we’re producing the most important breakthroughs at a near-constant rate. On a per-dollar or per-person basis, this suggests that science is becoming far less efficient.”</p>
<p>Collison and Nielsen are <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf">far from alone</a>. Cowen and Southwood <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/sites/brown.edu.academics.political-theory-project/files/uploads/Innovation%20%26%20scientific%20progress.pdf">argue</a> that “there is good and also wide-ranging evidence that the rate of scientific progress has indeed slowed down.” The 2019 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">paper</a>, “Are Good Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” argues that in semiconductors, agriculture, and medical innovations, “research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.”	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>They attempted to replicate this analysis for “the internal combustion engine, the speed of air travel, the efficiency of solar panels, the Nordhaus (1997) ‘price of light’ evidence, and the sequencing of the human genome.” But they couldn’t do so because there was no accurate measure of the amount of R&amp;D on those issues.</span>
	 That paper concludes by predicting that “just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty of finding new ideas.”</p>
<p>Of course, some of these assessments might be too <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">pessimistic</a>. But it is depressingly common to hear the world’s most innovative scientists lament that they would never have succeeded in today’s academic or funding system because their work was too outside the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Kornberg (a Nobel-winning biochemist) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">told the Washington Post in 2007</a> that his 1970s research on DNA “would never have gotten the necessary funding” if he had come along in the 2000s: “In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t be funded.”</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/201310090930/cuts-in-federal-funding-hurt-scientific-research">reported</a> in 2013, “UC Berkeley molecular biologist Randy Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine with two other scientists this week. But he says the kind of basic science research that led to his prize might have never gotten funded if he were applying for grants today.”</li>
<li>David Deutsch, who pioneered quantum computing, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/982233180081029128">says</a> that he would never have gotten his “first research grant on quantum computers . . . under today’s criteria.”</li>
<li>Peter Higgs, the Nobel Laureate for whom the Higgs Boson is named, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">believes</a> no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered ‘productive’ enough. . . . ‘Today I wouldn’t get an academic job. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.’”</li>
</ul>
<p>When so many top scientists say that their own work would never have passed muster in the current system, we must take stock of the current system. As prominent scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6441/613">have asked</a>, “How successful would Silicon Valley be if nearly 99% of all investments were awarded to scientists and engineers aged 36 years or older, along with a strong bias toward funding only safe, non-risky projects?” Moreover, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/07/science-holds-key-unlocking-economic-success/">common complaint</a> is that “scientists are forced to specify years in advance what they intend to do, and spend their time continually applying for very short, small grants” – hardly a system that would encourage innovation.</p>
<p>In short, we have evidence that US science funding is often fairly tame and incremental, that some of the most innovative science of the past would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/19/723326933/billion-dollar-gamble-how-a-singular-hero-helped-start-a-new-field-in-physics?fbclid=IwAR28fazRNhzzT5ijMINwzZkNqlP6fEfBlI4OLyY-eesrUyOfbZfF7-P4qUc">never have been funded</a> by today’s bureaucracy, and that scientific review panels are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/492034a">dominated by insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, innovation in science is imperiled. If Einstein had to navigate such a system, we might <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-einstein-get-published-today-11600974323">never have heard of relativity</a>. And even if innovation weren’t slowing down <em>per se</em>, we could still do better.</p>
<h2><b>What next?</b></h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas about how to improve scientific reproducibility in how federal research is funded. After all, quality control and assurance are hardly new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, we could require that data and computer code be shared openly so that others can scrutinize and rerun it. In too many cases to list, this sort of reanalysis has led to revisions, retractions, and even the discovery of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-a-gay-marriage-study-went-wrong">outright fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we could require that experiments and other empirical studies be pre-registered, so that the analysis and results are less likely to be cherry-picked later. We already do this for clinical trials in medicine, and a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382">review</a> of federally-sponsored clinical trials found that the rate of positive results went down dramatically as soon as researchers were required to pre-register their studies. We could do the same for much else in science. We could even move towards more widespread use of the Registered Reports format, in which journals accept an article for publication before the final results are even available.</p>
<p>It’s less obvious how to reform government funding so as to improve scientific <i>innovation</i>. Let’s try a thought experiment:</p>
<p>Imagine that you were the President 100 years ago, instead of Woodrow Wilson. Imagine that a time-traveling genie from the future tells you that over the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="bfa7"><a href="https://www.opendoor.com/" rel="noopener">Opendoor</a>, the nation’s largest <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48852-wth-is-an-ibuyer/" rel="noopener">iBuyer</a>, is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005665/en/" rel="noopener">going public</a>. It is doing so via a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp II (NYSE: IPOB), which is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by investor <a href="http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/index.html" rel="noopener">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Opendoor published an <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-Overview_vPDF_02.pdf" rel="noopener">investor presentation</a> as part of its merger announcement in September, and last week the company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000110465920112009/tm2030455-1_s41.htm" rel="noopener">filed its S-4</a> (similar to an S-1, but used for companies engaged in a merger process). The transaction values Opendoor at $4.8B (pre-merger value) and the company will receive north of $1B in proceeds ($600M <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe-deal.asp" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> and $414M via merger with IPOB). While the SPAC merger process is quite interesting on its own (good posts on the topic <a href="https://medium.com/@andyravreby/attack-of-the-spac-baafd47f6ecc" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/spac-attack-everything-a-founder" rel="noopener">here</a>), this post will focus in on the Opendoor business, its progress to date and its prospects for the future.</p><p id="ce64">Opendoor, founded in 2014, transforms the process of selling a home into a seamless digital experience, eliminating uncertainty for sellers. Sellers can go to Opendoor.com, receive an offer for their home, sign and close on the date of their choice — a dramatic improvement over the traditional selling process which can take 100+ days. In return, Opendoor receives a 6–12% discount on the market value of the home. This model is remarkably consistent with the vision described in Opendoor’s <a href="https://thomvest.box.com/v/opendoor_a" rel="noopener">Series A presentation</a> (worth a read). In addition to the spread captured when buying and selling homes, Opendoor earns revenue via ancillary services related to the real estate transaction, including title insurance, escrow services and home financing solutions.</p><p id="357e">In 2019, the company sold 18,799 homes across 21 markets, generating $4.7 billion in revenue (up more than 160% from the prior year). While the growth of the business has been impressive, Opendoor remains several years from profitability, having posted net losses of $339 million in 2019 and $117 million through the first half of 2020. Opendoor has ambitious plans to reach nearly 38,000 annual home sales and $10 billion in revenue by 2023. The company expects to become EBITDA-positive (on a non-GAAP basis) by the second half of 2023.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5208/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png" width="2604" height="920" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eefd">While the core vision of the company is quite elegant (“building the digital one-stop shop to move” according to Opendoor founder Eric Wu), the path to realizing that vision is incredibly complex. It requires thousands of employees across dozens of markets, holding billions in home value at any given time. So what is Opendoor’s path to becoming a large <em>and</em> profitable company? Below I’ve outlined <strong>five key</strong> <strong>“things you need to believe”</strong> as the company marches down that path, as well as some thoughts around the Opendoor’s valuation relative to other public real estate companies.</p><h2 id="a8ea">1. Opendoor’s economies of scale drive down per-unit expenses &amp; box-out competitors</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5220/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png" width="2610" height="1154" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ee83">Opendoor has built a massive home buying and selling operation that involves more than 1,000 employees across 21 markets. The company sold nearly 19,000 homes in 2019 (about 70 transactions per business day) and purchased thousands more. That scale is quite impressive given the fragmented, hyper-localized nature of real estate. This scale gives the company some important advantages:</p><ul><li id="0749">Opendoor has more borrowing capacity, a higher advance rate, and a lower cost of capital than many of its iBuyer peers; according to the company’s S-4, Opendoor has access to $2.8B in senior credit facilities with a total weighted average interest rate of 4%. It also has mezzanine facilities (loans that are subordinate to senior debt) in place to bring its effective advance rate to 100%. This allows the company to scale home purchase volume without tapping its own balance sheet.</li><li id="8800">Opendoor has developed a third-party network of more than 10,000 subcontractors, managed by a centralized operations team. This model has led to a 50% reduction in spend per home over the last 2 years. Additionally, the company has been able to negotiate bulk discounts on home materials (more than 40% lower than retail prices). According to <a href="https://www.mikedp.com/" rel="noopener">Mike DelPrete</a>, Opendoor’s average repair costs are about 2–2.5% of home value, compared to an estimated 4% at Offerpad and 5% at Zillow.</li></ul><p id="d50b"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="32f4">While economies of scale have definitely kicked in at Opendoor, there are also quite large fixed costs associated with operating the business that require <em>even greater</em> scale to overcome. For instance, in 2019 the company sold 18,799 homes and generated $301M in gross profit; however, its total operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit exceeded 180%.</p><p id="5020">Additionally, as the company continues to scale home purchase volume, incremental returns to scale may be diminished. For example, there are limitations to the bulk discounts suppliers can offer, limitations to cost of capital improvements, and some areas in which costs will always scale in proportion to volume (i.e. property taxes, utilities and insurance). And with time, its fellow iBuyers may achieve similar economies of scale. Given this dynamic, we expect the company to pursue incremental revenue streams as a means of improving its margin profile (more on this later).</p><h2 id="8003">2. Accumulating advantages makes the Opendoor business better &amp; more defensible over time</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5884/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png" width="2942" height="1140" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eced">In addition to cost advantages that come with scale, Opendoor has developed a set of <em>accumulating data advantages</em> that are more proprietary and durable in nature. This informs the price it offers prospective home sellers, as well as the renovations made on purchased homes in order to maximize ROI. From the S-4:</p><blockquote><p id="b5aa">We have conducted over 150,000 home assessments during which we collect over 100 data points on each home and its surroundings. These proprietary data points have led us to make over one billion annotations and corrections to Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”) and tax assessor data, as well as build out new, non-traditional geospatial data assets, such as power line ​proximity and road noise level. The additional home level data we collect from local vendors provides structured feedback on each home and further strengthens our data moat.</p></blockquote><p id="9893">This data asset leads to better pricing models that can assign specific values to home features (i.e. granite vs. tile countertops) as well as identify the areas in which home renovations may drive the highest return. Better pricing accuracy creates an important flywheel for the business: pricing accuracy improvements allow Opendoor to lower the fee it charges, which increases purchase volume, which in turn further contributes to its data asset and pricing accuracy. There are also accumulating advantages around brand which may improve Opendoor’s customer acquisition costs over time. It’s no surprise that despite the proliferation of iBuyers over the last several years, Opendoor remains the largest with 64% market share (as of 2019).</p><p id="eefe"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="14b6">As the chart above indicates, iBuyers in total capture about 0.7% of U.S. home sale volume (pre-COVID). In Phoenix, Opendoor has bought and sold homes for the last six years, completing thousands of transactions and refining its pricing and operational models along the way. In Q1 2020, Opendoor reached 4.1% market share in Phoenix before pausing home buying due to COVID-19.</p><p id="c9c2">While that’s certainty impressive scale in a single market, it’s also indicative of the potential limits to capturing even more share — a large subset of sellers may simply prefer to market their homes as opposed to selling to an iBuyer at a discount. The next chapter of Opendoor’s growth story may not come solely from better pricing models, but instead by building new products and services that cater to multiple customer segments.</p><h2 id="4df8">3. Opendoor will be able to increase gross profit per transaction via ancillary products and services</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5224/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png" width="2612" height="1064" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="6e55">Critical to the Opendoor strategy is its ability to attach additional products and services to its transactions. The company expects its gross profit per home to increase by about $8,000 in 2023, driven primarily by these ancillary revenue streams. In its investor presentation, Opendoor highlighted several service areas, including:</p><ul><li id="3bbb">Integrated title insurance and escrow services (via its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opendoor-acquires-title-and-escrow-company-os-national-300912033.html" rel="noopener">acquisition of OS National</a> in 2019). 80% of Opendoor home transactions that closed during 2019 included the in-house title &amp; escrow service (in the markets in which the service was available). This represents $1,750 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="f807">The company recently launched <a href="https://opendoorhomeloans.com/?abad=true" rel="noopener">Opendoor Home Loans</a>, a tech-enabled mortgage platform for customers looking to buy or refinance a home, which is licensed in eight states. This represents $5,000 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="7404">Opendoor plans to add additional services over time, such as home insurance, home warranty, moving and storage, and home repair and maintenance. It believes these services represent up to $7,500 in incremental margin per home.</li></ul><p id="695c">The roll out of multiple services allows the company to create incentives for bundling. For example, Opendoor may be willing to lower its home purchase fee (currently 6%-12%) if a customer agrees to finance their next home with Opendoor Home Loans, or purchases an Opendoor home insurance policy. Bundling may then improve seller conversion rates — according to Opendoor’s investor presentation, sellers are about twice as likely to sell their home at a 6% fee vs. a 12% fee.</p><p id="47cf">This strategy has been executed successfully by home builders for many years. For example, <a href="https://lennar.com/" rel="noopener">Lennar</a> has an in-house financing arm called Eagle Point, which is used by buyers to finance about 70% of Lennar’s home sales.</p><p id="8c30"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="f697">As the Lennar expample indicates, this strategy around attaching multiple revenue streams to a real estate transaction is not new — it’s common amongst real estate brokerages, home builders, and technology-enabled real estate companies like Zillow. While Opendoor has demonstrated that it can generate a high attach rate with title &amp; escrow, the company did not provide data around its mortgage business or buy-side services. Title &amp; escrow are typically viewed as commodity offerings and consumers are more likely …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A few days ago I read an interesting article titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922262686/your-technology-is-tracking-you-take-these-steps-for-better-online-privacy"><strong>“Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy”</strong></a> by Laurel Wamsley, who properly outlined the steps which every person on the internet should use, but to sum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords or passphrases for your accounts</li>
<li>Don’t use the same passwords</li>
<li>Use password managers</li>
<li>Use 2-factor authentication</li>
<li>Keep your phone and pc updated</li>
<li>Use a website instead of installing an app whenever possible</li>
<li>Use encrypted messaging apps</li>
<li>Turn off ad personalization</li>
</ul>
<p>And many other important details, I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>While I completely agree with all the steps mentioned in the article, the problem I see is that these steps are taken only by tech-people, because fixing privacy is getting more and more complicated. So, explaining to them to our loved ones is always harder and harder. Instead, I suggested them out-of-the-box easy to use solutions.</p>
<p>These solutions are the apps I personally use daily on all of my devices, they make much easier to manage my privacy and security on the internet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creating a successful new business is hard in any industry, but in insurance itâ€™s an especially daunting challenge. You need a world-class team, a differentiated product, and deeply supportive and patient carrier partners. Even with all of that, you need a healthy serving of luck.</p><p>At Newfront, weâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to have all of those ingredients. And while weâ€™re still a long way off from achieving our ambitions, today is an important milestone. We've spent the last three years focusing on building a strong business, and today we're announcing that <strong>weâ€™ve raised more than $100MM to date, most recently at a $500MM valuation</strong>. Founders Fund and Meritech Capital are our lead investors. A full list of investors is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abe-4">here</a>.</p><p>While our journey is far from over, this has certainly been a time for us to pause and reflect on how far weâ€™ve come. My own story with insurance began early in my career. I was lucky to help build two highly successful companies (Invitation Homes and Opendoor) and in both cases I was tasked with handling our property and casualty insurance. While happy to take care of something as critical as mitigating existential risk, I was stunned by the archaic and confusing process. I filled out mountains of paperwork, waited for weeks, and then received back wildly different options that were nearly impossible to compare. There was no clear dataset to help me understand which carriers to approach, which coverages to seek, or how peer businesses were buying. The process repeated each year, and was even worse when dealing with claims.</p><p>As a businessperson, it shocked me that the safety net so crucial to a functioning economy, innovation, and entrepreneurship could be so broken. I dug in and found that I wasnâ€™t alone in feeling the pain. My co-founder Gordon, an MIT grad who built a startup acquired by LinkedIn, had dealt with the pain of buying insurance for his company. For too many business owners, dealing with insurance has become an unpleasant, almost unbearable process. For insurance industry professionals, doing their jobs has become tedious, with the productivity gains made in other industries passing them by, forcing longer hours for lower pay. For industry leaders, attracting high-quality talent to the industry has become an existential challenge. I became obsessed with the idea of modernizing the industry by empowering the people at its core with purpose-built technology.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon and I launched Newfront in 2017, a year in which several startups were attracting huge investments with a goal of eliminating insurance brokers. We were convinced that their approach was dead wrong. We had already spent countless hours with CFOs, GCs, risk managers, and business owners and concluded that skilled insurance brokers are a <strong><em>foundational requirement</em></strong> for high-quality risk mitigation. The problem wasnâ€™t the broker, it was the brokerage. The typical brokerage forced brokers to behave like data collection and paperwork processing machines, preventing them from deepening their skills or providing expert advice. The brokerages had abandoned their brokers. We resolved to do something about that.</p><p>But first we needed to learn what had gone wrong. Why had brokerages fallen so far behind the innovation curve? Why was the average net promoter score for brokerages sitting at a dismal 17 (with 100 being the best)? Why werenâ€™t brokers given the tools that they needed? It didnâ€™t take long to learn that many of these changes resulted from the rise of private equity within the industry. Over a dozen years, private equity funds had purchased thousands of brokerages around the United States with an exclusive focus on generating short-term gains for their investors, rather than long term value for clients. These funds, which operate on short investment windows, do not have the time or incentive to make material investments in technology, the client experience, or tools to support brokers.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Our model is different. We have the resources, commitment, and know-how to create the brokerage that is truly built for the 21st century. A brokerage where we build our own technology and software in-house, where innovation is our mantra, and where improving outcomes and experiences for our clients is an obsession. While weâ€™ve learned a great deal over the past three years (and made plenty of mistakes along the way!), our founding thesis hasnâ€™t changed -- <strong><em>that the future of our industry combines experts with technology to better serve clients</em></strong>.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are a team of nearly 200, proudly serving over 5,000 clients across nearly every industry. While we are still only beginning our journey, our book already puts us in the top 100 brokerages in America. And weâ€™re just getting started.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

Despite the current situation, this hasn’t changed much. At the time of this writing, I submitted 439 different proposals to 215 unique conferences in 2020.</p> <p>I already wrote <a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some advice for junior conference speakers</a>. As a follow-up, I’d like to offer my view on the organization of conferences, from my speaker’s point-of-view. While the online and the on-site experiences are quite different, most of my feedback applies to both.</p> <div> <h2 id="do-send-approval-letters">DO send approval letters</h2> <div> <p>Let’s start easy. Just send approval emails when you’ve made the decision. It feels weird to learn about one’s acceptance from the conference website.</p> <p>For the record, it’s not a theoretical point. It happened to me on more than one occasion. Weird.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-send-rejection-letters">DO send rejection letters</h2> <div> <p>It goes without saying, but we need to plan our speaking gigs. I’m talking about travel and accommodation, but not only. Time spent at the conference is time that is not spent somewhere else:</p> <ul><li><span>if one is an employee, one needs to ask one’s boss</span></li><li><span>if one is a consultant, one needs to let know the customer about one’s time away</span></li><li><span>if one speaks professionally, choosing between conferences set during the same timeframe</span></li><li><span>etc.</span></li></ul> <p>Letting rejected speakers know about their status <strong>as early as possible</strong> allow them to plan depending on their respective situations.</p> <p>Please provide the date limit for which you’ll send acceptance/rejection letters along with the Call for Papers…​ and stick to it! It feels unpleasant to have to reach out to organizers to query one’s status after the date has passed.</p> <p>On the other side, I understand organizers might want to keep some options in case selected speakers cancel their attendance. But then, please be upfront about it, and communicate it straightforwardly: let speakers choose whether they accept this option or not.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-offer-feedback-on-rejections">DO offer feedback on rejections</h2> <div> <p>I get it, organizing a conference is a lot of work. Really. However, sending a rejection email with the same auto-generated statement sends a bad signal. Here’s a sample of the email I receive:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>We’re sorry to inform you that your proposal <em>REDACTED</em> for <em>REDACTED</em> was refused.</p> <p>Do keep in mind that we received over <em>X</em> proposals and the available slots are very limited!</p> <p>We would like to thank you sincerely for your proposal and shown interest.</p> <p>If you’re interested in purchasing a ticket for the conference we are happy to offer you a <em>Y%</em> discount using the following URL.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>It feels as if you care no more about speakers, once you’ve rejected their proposal(s). And still, this year’s rejected speakers could be next year’s accepted speakers.</p> <p><strong>If</strong> the selection process has been transparent, why don’t you provide the data you based your decision on? A bare minimum is to provide the feedback upon request. But it’s better if you send it along with the rejection email.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="dont-force-presentation-templates">DON’T force presentation templates</h2> <div> <p>Some conferences want to provide a sense of unity to presentations. For that reason, they provide a presentation template that speakers need to apply to each slide of their deck. It’s not a good idea:</p> <ol><li><span>Most templates are <strong>not</strong> templates. They are just slide decks. Hence, every speaker needs to copy-paste one’s content into the provided "template", then adapt it. I believe that the time I spend on this can be better spent rehearsing or digging deeper, or whatever.</span></li><li><span>I know at least the following widespread presentation software/stacks: Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, and Reveal.JS. It means organizers need to provide templates for them. Again, don’t you have anything else to spend your time on?</span></li></ol> <p>If your marketing team thinks this is important, there’s a much easier way. Just set a border on the screen where you display the slides - see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwcjOhD91Q0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it in action</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-organize-a-speakers-dinner">DO organize a speakers' dinner</h2> <div> <p>Among the benefits of being a speaker is the networking part: you get to meet interesting people, talk to them, know them and sometimes, keep in touch. This is only made possible because organizers take some time (and money?) to organize a time for speakers to mingle together.</p> <p>It’s a big miss if there’s no such time…​ and it removes a huge benefit of speaking at conferences.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-provide-a-quiet-room">DO provide a quiet room</h2> <div> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Note"></i> </td> <td> Obviously, the following items are not meant for online conferences. But the pandemics are not going to last forever. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Some speakers I know of travel <em>a lot</em>. Providing a room where they can rest is basic care.</p> <p>I didn’t use the term "speakers room", but "quiet room" on purpose: Speakers are not special snowflakes that need to be protected from the crowd. I’m not against a dedicated speakers' room if one is available. But the most important property is that it must be <strong>quiet</strong>.</p> <p>There’s one more requirement: provide enough power plugs so that speakers can recharge their laptops (and phones), for this conference - and potentially the next one(s).</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-provide-wifi">DO provide Wifi</h2> <div> <p>I benefit from a great mobile phone plan, with 25Gb data across all European countries plus several other countries. Otherwise, I know that not every mobile company has such a plan.</p> <p>For this reason, it’s useful to provide a free <strong>reliable</strong> Wifi. There should be one dedicated to speakers so that it can deliver data with acceptable speed. If the Wifi is open to everyone, the risk is that a lot of attendees will connect and make the network unusable. Note that it doesn’t prevent the conference to provide two Wifi networks, one for speakers and one for attendees.</p> <p>Extra points if the password is available on the badge, or in the speakers' room. While it seems to be a great idea to send the password by email, speakers receive a lot of emails, and there’s a high chance they will overlook it. The lesson here is that it’s not enough to give the right data, you should provide it at the right time.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-have-a-dedicated-speakers-registration-desk">DO have a dedicated speakers' registration desk</h2> <div> <p>I already wrote that speakers are not special snowflakes. Let me reinstate it here. And yet, we do have specific constraints.</p> <p>It’s not uncommon to rush directly from the airport to the venue, just in time for our talk. If we need to queue, we might be running late, which is bad for everybody: speaker, attendees, and organizers.</p> <p>Hence, a dedicated registration queue is more than appreciated, it’s necessary. Even better, give out the badges at the speakers' dinner, or send an email with a QR code ahead of time.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-have-a-dedicated-speakers-lunch-queue">DO have a dedicated speaker’s lunch queue</h2> <div> <p>For the same reason, I’d recommend having a dedicated speaker’s queue for lunch. In general, I am always stressed to be on time. This is worse if the conference scheduled my talk in the slot just after lunchtime: having to queue for ages and see the clock ticking won’t make my talk better, far from it.</p> <p>This is worse if the food is bad…​ Sorry, I’m French.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="dodont-rank-talks">DO/DON’T rank talks</h2> <div> <p>Ranking talks is good, depending on what one wants to achieve. In my experience, I’ve seen two reasons:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Provide feedback to the speaker, in the spirit of continuous improvement</dt> <dd> <p>As a speaker, I care most about that. There’s always room for improvement, and I can get better if I get the right feedback. In that case, grades are useless: comments are the most useful way to get this feedback.</p> <p>Yes, I understand that most attendees won’t leave any comment at all, but I prefer a couple of worthwhile comments instead of all the room leaving good grades.</p> </dd> <dt>Competition</dt> <dd> <p>Who doesn’t want to have the best talk at a conference, or at least be in the top X? I, for sure, love when it happens. Yet, at the same time, I must admit it brings nothing but a nice rub on my ego.</p> <p>As conference organizers, if you want to provide a grading system, make it at least fair. For example, I’ve had experienced the following: the grading system discards the votes where there are less than 20 votes. That seems like a good idea because lower numbers mean they are not representative. Now, as conference organizers, you schedule the most well-known speakers in the biggest room, with a 300 seats' capacity. Other rooms have 50 seats' capacity. But it’s nearly impossible to have 20 votes out of 50 people - provided the room is full.</p> <p>As a consequence, only talks that took place in the 300 seats' room can compete. This is the poster child for self-fulfilling prophecies: the organizers were right to put those talks in this room!</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-expense-speakers">DO expense speakers</h2> <div> <p>This last point might be the most controversial. But what would be a conference without speakers? Shouldn’t they be cared for? This requires a bit of context.</p> <p>First, is the conference community-based or commercial? Or to put it more bluntly, is the conference’s main goal to make money, or not? In the first case, it stands to reason to help speakers by reimbursing their travels and accommodations expenses and even paying for their time. If community-based conferences that charge attendees a low fee can reimburse, what reason would money-oriented ones invoke not to?</p> <p>Then, there’s the profile of the speaker. Speaking is now my job, but before that, I took time off to speak at conferences. If I used my own free time to speak at your conference, why would I also pay for travel and accommodation?</p> <p>Some conferences consider themselves above that: they attract enough good speakers as it is. That’s fine…​ if you belong to that exclusive club. If not, then my advice would be to think about your speakers' compensation scheme and to be transparent about it.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-rotate-speakers">DO rotate speakers</h2> <div> <p>I understand that some speakers are so good that it’s a hard choice for conference organizers to do without them. These speakers attract attendees who are the measure of the success of a conference.</p> <p>On the flip side, for some conferences, only the names of the talk change from year to year. Speakers are the same. Think that it becomes perhaps boring to watch the same speaker, even the greatest ones, at one point or another.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <div> <p>Most of the advice above should be common sense. It feels redundant having to write it. But it’s not.</p> <p>If you’re a conference organizer, I’d be grateful if you took some …</p></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently spent quite a bit of time setting up an Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster on AWS. Creating all the required resources from scratch was a bit more involved than I’d hope for so it left me wondering if there was a better way for developers who want on-demand containers without having to set up and manage the networking infrastructure and resources required to start working with ECS.</p>
<p>So, I figured let’s give Azure Container Instances a try! I think it worked out pretty well. Let’s take a closer look, if you prefer the Tweet-consumable version of this, I also made a thread on my experience with it:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweeting my first look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Azure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@azure</a> container instances, I was fed up with having to literally create dozens of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a> networking resources to get a single ECS container running so let's see how <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Azure?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Azure</a> does it!</p>— Fernando (@fmc_sea) <a href="https://twitter.com/fmc_sea/status/1313634251196096512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>For this demo, I assume you already have an Azure subscription and you have the Azure CLI setup on your machine and that you have a little experience with Docker but I don’t directly use it in this guide.</p>
<h2 id="creating-our-first-azure-container-instance">Creating Our First Azure Container Instance</h2>
<p>The first thing we do is to create a resource group that our container will be put in. We can do this from the Azure CLI with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az group create <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--location westus
</code></pre></div><p>Then I just create the container? After coming from ECS that seems… too easy? But let’s try it using the default image that Azure gives us in the docs and trying to claim my snazzy <code>fernando</code> subdomain:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container create <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld <span>\
</span><span></span>--dns-name-label fernando <span>\
</span><span></span>--ports <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For me, the command stalled for about 60 seconds before it provided a <code>- Running ...</code> prompt to me. Seems like a weird experience to wait on a CLI command, I’d expect it to register the command and then I could check on the status but I supposed this isn’t a bad thing as I’m probably going to want to know when it finishes.</p>
<p>Presumably there’s some sort of <code>--dont-show-me-the-status-just-create-it-and-ill-check-later</code> flag I don’t know about to solve problems with scripting this out. What’s that you say? It’s <code>--no-wait</code>? Ahh. Well, yeah I suppose that makes more sense.</p>
<p>One confusing part is that the documentation says I’m supposed to check on the result with this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container show <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--query <span>"{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>--out table
</code></pre></div><p>So this part was a bit confusing. Do I need to wait and then run the command? Or can I just wait as it seems like it’s ready when it finishes?</p>
<p>When I do run the show command it returns the ProvisioningState of my container:</p>
<pre><code>FQDN                               ProvisioningState
---------------------------------  -------------------
fernando.westus.azurecontainer.io  Succeeded
</code></pre><p>HAH! I totally snagged the <code>fernando</code> subdomain - Sorry other Fernandos in the West US - I GOT HERE FIRST! With this provisioned, let’s check it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://fernandomc.com/images/azure-container-instances/azure-container-instance-demo-app.png" alt="Screenshot of Azure Container Instance Demo App"></p>
<p>A beautiful, pretty boring demo app. But there is some magic in that I only had to run <strong>two commands</strong> to get it up.</p>
<p>Getting this same damn thing with AWS ECS took me about twenty minutes of configuring a VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Internet Gateway, ECS Cluster and Task and some other things I probably forgot.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-our-azure-container-instance">Customizing Our Azure Container Instance</h2>
<p>Ok so what if I want something more interesting in here though. I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia">Theia</a> recently for other tinkering so let’s see how hard it is to get a custom Docker image up as a Container Instance.</p>
<p>We could probably just run the same commands as before and replace the image name with the Docker image name I want right? Let’s give it a shot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container create <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--image theiaide/theia-python:latest <span>\
</span><span></span>--dns-name-label fernando-theia <span>\
</span><span></span>--ports <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After 3 minutes and 35 seconds (yes I timed you Azure Container Instances team!) the CLI told me the container instance was up and running. To get the new domain name again I used:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container show <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--query <span>"{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>--out table
</code></pre></div><p>And here we are:</p>
<pre><code>FQDN                                     ProvisioningState
---------------------------------------  -------------------
fernando-theia.westus.azurecontainer.io  Succeeded
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, I clearly don’t know how to use Theia at all so loading the container at that URL timed out. Possibly because I need to configure a different port.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, there is no <code>az container update</code> which is mildly confusing but I supposed I can just try the create command again with a new port number and hope for the best!</p>
<pre><code>az container create \
--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances \
--name fmc-theia-container \
--image theiaide/theia-python:latest \
--dns-name-label fernando-theia \
--ports 3000
</code></pre><p>I love it when guesses work out! It appears like this operation worked and it only took ~10 seconds as opposed to the actual creation of the container instance which was a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="checking-azure-container-instance-logs">Checking Azure Container Instance Logs</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, even though my configuration now appears to expose TCP traffic on port 3000 I’m still unable to get any response. Let’s see what’s happening under the hood:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container logs --resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container
</code></pre></div><p>Ahh the logs! Here’s what’s going on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yarn run v1.22.4
$ /home/theia/node_modules/.bin/theia start /home/project --hostname<span>=</span>0.0.0.0
root INFO Configuration directory URI: <span>'file:///root/.theia'</span>
root INFO Configuring to accept webviews on <span>'.+.webview..+'</span> hostname.
root WARN The directory referenced by local-dir:/root/.theia/plugins does not exist.
root WARN The directory referenced by local-dir:/root/.theia/extensions does not exist.
root INFO Theia app listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000.

... There were more logs but I cut them out because you can only look at so many lines

root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"xml@1.39.1-prel"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-builtin-xml/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"yaml@1.39.1-prel"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-builtin-yaml/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"EditorConfig@0.14.4"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-editorconfig/extension/out/editorConfigMain.js"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"python@2020.1.58038"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-python/extension/out/client/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploy plugins list took: 337.3 ms
</code></pre></div><p>Basically, it appears like Theia is configured with 0.0.0.0 with port 3000 and from the command I ran earlier I know port 3000 should be exposed? This, in combination with the long list of installation logs and out means that in all likelihood I just didn’t wait long enough for all these dependencies to install.</p>
<p>After visiting the link again I now have the Theia container running and functioning as I expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://fernandomc.com/images/azure-container-instances/theia.png" alt="Screenshot of Theia container running in my browser"></p>
<p>It comes prebuilt with Node and Python, perfect for some messing around with and integrating in later projects.</p>
<h3 id="custom-port-mapping">Custom Port Mapping</h3>
<p>But what if I’m not a fan of making myself go to port 3000 when I visit this? In other systems I might be able to set up some port mapping from port 3000 to port 80 so I can visit the domain without the port suffix.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears in <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/602224-azure-container-instances/suggestions/34082284-support-for-port-mapping">this Azure Feedback post</a> that there is no support for anything other then symmetrical port mapping. This means I either have to modify my container or be satisfied with port 3000. Ahh well! Another day.</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h2>
<p>Finally, time to make sure I clean up my resources so I’m not paying for them:</p>
<p>Delete the theia container group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Delete the first demo container group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Delete the resource group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az group delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Remember to answer <code>y</code> to those prompts.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I found getting started here pretty fun. I do have some option questions that I might dive into in later posts. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the distinction between containers and container groups? How do these function together/separately?</li>
<li>Are there other resources here that I need to be aware of in order to clean them up after? (Hopefully no?)</li>
<li>How do I integrate applications in these containers with other Azure services?</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall though, I find this model of deploying containers a lot more intuitive and simple to get started with. Do you want to see more about Azure or about Azure Container Instances? Leave a comment below or reach out to me and let me know!</p>

                    <h3>VED-X: A Versatile Event Detection Framework</h3>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>VED-X is a novel Few Shot Learning framework capable of learning specific visual events (as opposed to objects only)
                        using only a few samples. To train a model that can recognize an event, the user needs to provide only a few positive
                        samples (snapshots of when the event is happening) and a few negative samples (snapshots of when
                        the event is not happening.) The trained model can then recognize the event
                        with a good accuracy and if the model makes a mistake (false positive/false negative), the
                        user can flag the mistake. The user's feedback is then incorporated into the model and the model keeps
                        getting better over time.</p>
                    <p>First, watch some of <strong><a href="#examples"><u>our pre-recorded demos</u></a></strong> to see how it works.
                        Then run a live experiment using a webcam (on desktop) below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The model learns your event of interest based on your given samples only. At a high level,
                        it tries to guess your event of interest by finding the most distinct aspects of the
                        positive samples that are not present in the negative samples. So the main
                        distinction between your positive and negative samples must be your event of interest.
                    </li><li>The trained model is capable of generalizing to a good degree. In other words, it is robust to
                         some variations it has not seen in the training samples. However, depending on the event, some
                         variations might reduce the accuracy. Adding more diversity to your samples increases
                         the model's robustness to new variations.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the main difference between your positive and negative samples is your event of
                        interest, otherwise the model might focus on a different aspect. For example, if your event is
                        "person riding a bike" and in most of your negative samples, there is no person or bike, the model may think
                        "person appearing" or "bike appearing" is your event of interest.
                    </li><li>Your event of interest&nbsp;must be visible in all your positive samples. Currently, we are streaming at
                        a low resolution (400px by 400px), so your event must be clearly visible at that resolution.</li>
                    <li>We recommend using Chrome or Firefox to run a live demo. Some functionalities may not work as
                        expected on some of the other web browsers.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Does the model incorporate temporal behavior?<br>Currently, the model is limited to static events,
                        i.e. events that can be characterized by only one snapshot. We have found this covers most visual
                        events of interest.</li>
                    <li>Can I train a model to recognize a specific person?<br>The model is not capable of learning
                        the distinct facial features very accurately but it can distinguish between people with different
                        appearances.</li>
                    <li>Can the models run at the edge?<br>It would be
                        possible to deploy the models at the edge depending on the hardware specifications and the desired performance.</li>
                    <li>How can I access the API?<br>Please, email us at founders@visualone.tech for access to the API.

<p>Docker is easily one of the most popular and sought after technologies to learn these days. Docker has only been growing in popularity since the initial release in 2013. Many companies and developers have adopted Docker as their defacto tool to deploy and test development and production level applications. In this concise, quick start guide, we’ll get hands-on with Docker to help you get started quickly to immediately use it for your projects.</p>

<p>Docker is an OS-level virtualization technology that can help you build and run containers. It makes it easy to package your code into containers with all the necessary components to run anywhere with Docker Engine installed. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not require you to install Guest-OS. Containers run on a single operating system using much fewer resources than virtual machines, making containers a much lighter weight solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Docker allows you to package your application with all the dependencies into a container. Docker also keeps track of each container image you build and versions them for you, much like version control systems such as Git. And since every container is a standardized portable file, you can be sure that your application will run 100% the same on any machine.</p>

<p>With Docker, the headache of managing your application in different environments, such as development and production, is significantly reduced. Because a docker image contains the complete runtime environment and dependencies for your application to run, it solves the dreaded developer problem of “it works on my machine.”</p>

<p>A Docker Container Image is a portable, executable package containing your application code, runtime, libraries, and everything required for your application to run smoothly and securely. Many people use the words image and container interchangeably; however, they are not the same thing. You can think of an image as a blueprint for architectural design or a meal recipe.</p>

<p>A Docker Container or simply Container is the result or finished product of your blueprint or recipe. In technical terms, It’s the name given to a running instance of your docker container image. You can launch multiple container instances from one container image, much like how you can create several meals using the same recipe.</p>

<p>Suppose a container is a result or final product of a recipe or blueprint. In that case, Dockerfile is the instructions on how to put that final product or recipe together. Dockerfile contains the complete instructions on how Docker should build your container image, which resources and assets to include, the ports that the container exposes, etc. It’s a step by step definition file on how to construct a container image.</p>

					<div>
						<p>The question of how scientific advances flow through to practical applications is central to our understanding of progress, and guides research funding policy.</p>
<p>The tone on this issue for the second half of the 20th century was set in 1945 by Vannevar Bush’s landmark report “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">Science, the Endless Frontier</a>”. One theme, already widely accepted in American industrial culture and given official voice in Bush’s report, was that basic research, although not guided by practical uses, is nonetheless necessary for long-term progress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends. … The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the early 1950s, the newly created National Science Foundation was justifying its mission based on an explicit model of technological development as a flow from basic research through to development. Quoting from the NSF’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1952/annualreports/ar_1952_sec2.pdf">second annual report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technological sequence consists of basic research, applied research, and development… each of the successive stages depends upon the preceding. Unlimited expansion of effort toward applied research and development, without corresponding support for basic research, will defeat the entire effort by limiting technological progress to minor improvements and refinements of obsolete processes and equipment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an important truth in this “linear model” of innovation. But there is also much more interaction between science and invention than a naive interpretation of the model would imply.</p>
<p>The truth in the model is that science is, in an important sense, the foundation for invention. The <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won">electric power industry</a> would not have been possible before the science of electromagnetism: Michael Faraday’s 1831 discovery that a moving magnet creates a current in a nearby wire is the law that the electric generator, deployed widely decades later, depends on. Plastics were not created until chemistry was well-established: the first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was created by a Belgian-American chemist, Leo Baekeland, after <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html#invention-of-bakelite">careful experimentation</a> inspired by the potential of phenol-formaldehyde compounds established by previous researchers.</p>
<p>Technological development is possible through ad-hoc tinkering, but without a scientific base, such development eventually plateaus. Sanitation reformers made only limited progress against disease before the germ theory, because they were guided only by perceptible qualities such as the look, smell, and taste of the water supply. The understanding that microbes were the cause of disease refined their understanding of the goal and gave them new ways to measure the success of their efforts. It was after this, for example, that <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp">chlorination was added to water treatment</a>, and pasteurization to food processing.</p>
<p>Practical applications often flow naturally from science: a deeper understanding of nature suggests possible uses. But science does not flow from applications, because it is not obvious <i>what </i>science might apply to a given problem. As <a href="https://gemenne.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/nelson-basic-economics-of-scientific-research.pdf">Richard Nelson pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is seriously to be doubted whether X-ray analysis would ever have been discovered by any group of scientists who, at the turn of the century, decided to find a means for examining the inner organs of the body … It seems most unlikely that a group of scientists in the mid-nineteenth century, attempting to develop a better method of long-range communication, would have developed Maxwell’s equations and radio.</p></blockquote>
<p>The impact of science on invention is long-term and often impossible to foresee. There are some times, certainly, when scientific pursuits have obvious applications: when Robert Koch identified the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, he must have known that this would someday help us prevent or cure the disease. But when Bohr peered into the structure of the atom, or when Rutherford and Curie investigated the nature of radiation, it is doubtful that they expected their work to lead to nuclear power or MRI scans.</p>
<p>Investments in science, then, if motivated by long-term progress, cannot be prioritized by immediate practical impact. It requires, in Bush’s words, “the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.”</p>
<p>However, in the naive interpretation of this model, the stages are fully distinct, non-overlapping, and separated by a clean handoff. Science is pursued out of pure curiosity, with no thought of applications. It discovers elegant natural laws, which are crisply formulated, written down, and then thrown over the transom to engineering. Invention is then a straightforward process of deductively applying these laws to practical problems.</p>
<p>But the relationship between science and invention is not one-way. It is reciprocal.</p>
<p>Invention is rarely, if ever, a pure deduction from established physical laws. Inventors tinker, often right at the boundaries of scientific knowledge—where the best opportunities are. Edison famously tested thousands of materials as filaments for his light bulb to find one that would last long enough to make the bulb economical. Charles Goodyear <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-goodyear">experimented for many years</a> to create an improved form of rubber that would not become soft in the heat or brittle in the cold, finally hitting on pressure-treating with sulfur as the key process to create what he would call “vulcanized”&nbsp;rubber. Even today, drugs are discovered by screening thousands of compounds against a target.</p>
<p>Science, of course, often <i>guides</i> this experimentation. Edison was specifically <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/lamp.htm">looking for a high-resistance material</a>; he knew from his understanding of the physics of electric circuits that a high-resistance bulb would require less power. Drug compounds, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790789/">including some early antibiotics</a>, are discovered by modifying “side chains” of a known molecule. Without scientific background knowledge, pure tinkering often has too many possibilities to explore; science narrows the search.</p>
<p>Sometimes when an invention is produced by tinkering, science cannot explain its operating characteristics, or even why it works at all. Aspirin was first marketed in 1899, but its mechanism of action <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20631416/">wasn’t explained until 1971</a>. These cases can inspire new theories or even entire new fields. The field of thermodynamics was created in the 1800s in part to explain the working of heat engines, such as the steam engines that had been invented in the previous century. A better scientific understanding of technology then helps us optimize or expand it. The first vaccine, for smallpox, was <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines">invented in 1796</a>, but no one was able to replicate this success for any other disease until almost ninety years later, after the advent of the germ theory.</p>
<p>When the right researchers are brought together in the right environment, this iterative process combining both science and engineering can even be driven forward by the same people, in the same lab, on a single project. A dramatic example is <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention">the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs</a>. Researchers went back to the drawing board multiple times to improve the theory of semiconductor physics, in order to explain their experimental results. Each improvement to the theory let them make the next advance in engineering: from failed prototypes, to the first working “point-contact” transistor, to the improved “junction” transistor that became the standard design.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest researchers were those who were able to pivot rapidly from discovery to invention, or vice versa, as the opportunity arose. The master of this was <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, a pioneer of microbiology. Some of his greatest scientific discoveries came from projects with purely practical, commercial goals. His work to improve the processes of wine, beer, and vinegar makers led to the discovery of anaerobic metabolism and the role of microbes in fermentation; his assistance to the growers of silk worms gave him observations that ultimately led to the germ theory of disease. At other times, while engaged in scientific research, Pasteur was able to seize on an accidental discovery when he saw its practical applications. This is how a botched experiment with chicken cholera led to <a href="https://www.vbivaccines.com/wire/louis-pasteur-attenuated-vaccine/">the first laboratory-created vaccines</a>, including a vaccine for rabies.</p>
<p>So the “clean handoff” model is wrong. Instead, we should replace it with a “gap” model. Science gives inventors a conceptual framework: a toolbox of categories, principles, and equations that provide fertile ground for practical experimentation. But through experimentation, inventors can discover working solutions outside the bounds of what has been fully explained by science. They can’t get <i>too </i>far ahead of scientific understanding—Bell Labs would never even have created a semiconductor research group if physics hadn’t first identified semiconductors as a material.</p>
<p>But if the distance between known science and a desired invention is short enough, they can cross the gap. They can bridge the gap with their own experiments, extending scientific knowledge; or they can leap over it, ending up with an invention that works for reasons yet to be explained. Leaping the gap can actually pull science forward, giving it new phenomena to explore and new motivation to do so.</p>
<p>As a consequence, influence does not flow in one direction only, from science to invention. Invention feeds back into science, and rapid progress can come from a tight integration of the two.</p>
<p>Our assumptions about how research happens guide how we fund, organize, and manage it.</p>
<p>The great corporate laboratories of the early 20th century, which integrated basic research and product development under one roof, <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-rd-lab/">have gone into decline</a>. Today the people, projects, and institutions who do science and invention are more separate than they were in those days. Startups and venture capitalists mostly don’t do …</p></div></div></div>

<p>John McCain was in a wistful mood.</p>



<p>It was the spring of 2017 and I was visiting him for what would turn out to be the final time in his Senate office on Capitol Hill.</p>



<p>After catching me up on the latest in our home state of Arizona, McCain turned to another of his passions: Europe. The senator had just returned from a swing through the Balkans (spending time in one of Tito’s hunting lodges, among other places) and he was worried that neither Washington nor the Europeans were paying enough attention to the security situation there and the broader region, especially regarding the threat posed by Russia. What about the Germans, I asked, knowing how frustrated McCain had been with Berlin’s stance on Russia over the years. (In 2015, McCain, enraged over Berlin’s refusal to help arm Ukraine, <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-02/ukraine-angela-merkel-john-mccain-kritik-waffen?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com" target="_blank">said</a> Angela Merkel’s course reminded him of “the policies of the 1930s,” a reference to the U.K.’s ill-fated appeasement strategy towards Hitler). </p>



<p>McCain, who never abandoned the vernacular of his fighter-pilot days, cracked a mischievous smile.</p>



<p>“The fucking Germans,” he laughed. “What is there to say?”</p>



<p>Were he still alive, McCain would no doubt have plenty to say about the foreign policy trajectory of Merkel’s government in recent years.</p>



<p>Since McCain’s death in 2018, Germany has refused to back the U.S. on just about every major foreign policy front, whether concerning China, Russia, Iran, Israel or the broader Middle East.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Berlin continues to fall short of NATO defense spending targets and the defense ministry’s procurement practices — in recent days it had to scrap plans to order a new standard-issue <a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/bundeswehr-selects-haenel-mk-556-assault-rifle-to-replace-g36" target="_blank">assault rifle</a> over a patent dispute — remain a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-biggest-enemy-threadbare-army-bundeswehr/">comedy of errors</a>.</p>



<p>It’s tempting to blame this new transatlantic divide on Donald Trump, his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/donald-trump-nato-not-obsolete-237166" target="_blank">questioning</a> of NATO’s purpose and his bizarre love-hate <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/how-trump-made-war-on-angela-merkel-and-europe" target="_blank">obsession</a> with both Merkel and Germany, the land of his forebears.</p>



<p>McCain, no fan of Trump’s, would no doubt join that chorus. But he would also likely point out that the underlying divisions predate Trump and cut to a more fundamental question: Whose side is Germany on anyway?</p>



<p>No one on either side of the Atlantic is even trying to paper over the deep differences in the relationship anymore. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/MKarnitschnig/status/1313770388392943616?s=20" target="_blank">asked</a> Christian Lindner, the leader of Germany’s Free Democrats, an ostensibly pro-American party, what his expectations for the German-American partnership were. His reply: “What transatlantic relationship are you referring to still?”</p>



<p>With German-American relations at their lowest ebb since World War II, McCain’s frustration with German policy offers a reminder that the American transatlantic establishment’s exasperation with Germany runs deep and is bipartisan. Trump’s outrageous taunts have prompted many Germans to forget that Barack Obama also pressured Berlin to spend more on defense. Indeed, the first president to criticize the Europeans as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/middleeast/obama-criticizes-the-free-riders-among-americas-allies.html" target="_blank">free riders</a>” was Obama.</p>



<p>That history suggests that hopes among many in Berlin that U.S.-German ties will somehow revert to the earlier norm if Joe Biden (a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf" target="_blank">close friend</a> of McCain’s over decades) wins the presidency aren’t just overblown: They’re a fantasy.</p>



<h3>No going back</h3>



<p>One big reason there is no going back is Washington’s focus on China, one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus across the American political divide.</p>



<p>“As U.S. foreign policy becomes increasingly focused on strategic competition with China and subordinates relationships with long-standing allies to that overriding priority, Europe will be faced with difficult choices — whoever is president,” Chatham House’s Hans Kundnani recently <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/us-foreign-policy-priorities/02-transatlantic-relations" target="_blank">observed</a>.</p>



<p>Yet there’s a more prosaic explanation for why there’s no turning back the transatlantic clock: Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, it has become increasingly difficult to explain to Americans why the country even needs to be in Europe.</p>



<p>This is particularly true of the American military presence in Germany, where the U.S. has anchored its European engagement for decades. Trump’s attacks on Berlin’s modest military spending may trigger outrage in Germany, but in the U.S., they are viewed as among his less controversial outbursts.</p>



<p>That might be because, like Obama before him, he has a point. Why should the U.S. continue to bear the financial brunt of protecting Europe’s richest country? That question becomes even tougher to answer when considering Germany’s continued engagement with Russia — such as via the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-germany-cant-say-no-to-nord-stream/">Nord Stream 2</a> gas pipeline — despite the loud objections of the U.S. and other allies.</p>



<p>Last month, Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S. who is now chairman of the Munich Security Conference, the annual powwow of the transatlantic alliance, <a href="https://www.ardmediathek.de/daserste/video/anne-will/giftanschlag-auf-nawalny-aendert-deutschland-jetzt-seine-russland-politik/das-erste/Y3JpZDovL25kci5kZS8wYzM2ZTdlZi0yMzUzLTRkNjAtOTlkNC04MDJiODE0YWI0NjU/" target="_blank">cautioned</a> against canceling Nord Stream 2 in the wake of Russia’s suspected poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent.</p>



<p>Halting the project would “unleash a triumphant yowl in the Trump administration,” Ischinger told a prime-time audience on German television.</p>



<p>In other words, it was more important to keep Germany’s word to Russia than to hand Trump the appearance of a win, especially after the threats Washington had been making for months to sanction anyone connected with the project. Never mind that the U.S. is supposedly Berlin’s closest ally, with troops and nuclear arms based in Germany to protect it from, of all countries, Russia.</p>



<p>So far, the German government has followed Ischinger’s advice and shown little inclination to abandon the pipeline, a move Berlin worries would further provoke Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Part of the German calculus in resisting U.S. pressure is a conviction that the U.S. needs Germany almost as much as Germany needs the U.S. </p>



<p>Trump’s “approach comes with damaging consequences, more so for the U.S. than for Germany,” Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee and a conservative candidate to replace Merkel, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-chancellor-candidate-norbert-rottgen/">told</a> me recently, referring to Trump’s decision to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the country by about one-third. “It’s difficult to work with that kind of irrationality.”</p>



<h3>Questionable calculus</h3>



<p>Yet the core of this argument — that the U.S. needs its German presence to “project power” and to carry out <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/catos-letter/endless-war-middle-east" target="_blank">endless wars</a> in the Middle East — is rooted more in the realities of the administration of George W. Bush than what U.S. strategy is likely to look like in the years to come as Washington redirects its focus and resources on the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Despite that strategic shift and the deep tensions in the German-American relationship, saying “Auf Wiedersehen” is far from straightforward. The transatlantic lobby – an alphabet soup of German and American think tanks populated by a motley assortment of academics, retired generals and ambassadors, some on the payroll of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex" target="_blank">military-industrial complex</a>” —&nbsp;is intent on preserving the relationship, come what may. The same is true for many in Congress, including Republicans.</p>



<p>Some observers believe the best way forward would be to “redefine” NATO, by shifting more of the burden to Europe. While Washington has made some progress on this front in recent years, prodding other members to devote more resources to their militaries, the U.S. still accounts for about 70 percent of NATO members’ total defense spending.</p>



<p>“You have to get out of the mindset that this is a protectorate type of relationship … it is corrosive for both sides,” said Dan Hamilton, a prominent American voice on transatlantic affairs who has spent decades rotating between academia and diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic. “It gives the Americans this kind of patronal attitude towards the Europeans and means the Europeans don’t have to do much.”</p>



<p>Though many Europeans would no doubt welcome that kind of partnership, it’s far from clear that Germans would. Germany, though it has spent more recently, remains a laggard on defense. Indeed, the country’s military is so beset with dysfunction after years of neglect that it is difficult to see a fundamental improvement anywhere on the horizon. Less than half of Germans think military spending should go up, according to a recent <a href="https://securityconference.org/assets/01_Bilder_Inhalte/03_Medien/02_Publikationen/MSC_Germany_Report_10-2020_De.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the Munich Security Conference. </p>



<p>Public perceptions of the U.S. in Germany have rarely been worse. Only 26 percent of Germans have a “positive” view of the U.S., according to a Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/15/us-image-plummets-internationally-as-most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly/" target="_blank">study</a> released last month, the lowest rate in any country except Belgium. That contrasts with favorability ratings for the U.S. of between 40 percent and 45 percent in Spain, Italy and the U.K. </p>



<p>A similarly low percentage of Germans (27 percent) considers the U.S. to be the country’s most important military ally, the Munich Security Conference study found. Roughly half of Germans said France is the country’s most important ally.</p>



<p>On a purely objective basis, the findings are staggering. Whether Germans like it or not, the country’s reliance on the U.S. for its security is to all intents and purposes total. </p>



<p>Even if the U.S. goes through with the troop withdrawal, the country will have more troops in Germany than in almost any other country in the world. Their presence — whether their primary purpose is to protect Germany directly or not — adds to the security umbrella also guaranteed by America’s nuclear arsenal.</p>



<p>Though German economic reliance on the U.S. has waned somewhat with China’s rise, America remains Germany’s biggest export market and a key manufacturing hub for the likes of BMW and Siemens. </p>



<p>Most commentators attribute Germans’ dismal opinion of the U.S. to their visceral dislike of Trump. But that’s only part of the story. Americans who believe most Germans feel they still owe the U.S. any gratitude for rehabilitating the country after World War II and for paving the way for reunification are kidding themselves. Even the country’s elites view America as a “frenemy” at best. The recent social …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>It’s a tool that allows you to enter pinyin and optionally a tone number and shows only the <em>commonly used</em> Chinese characters with this pronunciation.</p>

<p>It allows you to switch between the top 3500 character list (frequently used) or the top 6500 (relatively common),</p>

<p>Some other features include showing or hiding all pinyin pronunciations for the characters, and showing or searching by the index of the character from the source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a>.</p>

<p>It currently only deals with simplified characters, because that’s what the source deals with and what I’m trying to learn.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a comprehensive Chinese learning tool. To learn Chinese you need to learn words, not just characters. Characters are just one layer in the Chinese language, and even full understanding of all Chinese characters would not mean you’ve learned the language.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-made-this">Why I made this</h2>

<p>While learning Chinese, I wanted to get an understanding of which Chinese characters are actually in common use. If you look in a dictionary for a list of Chinese characters, you will get a bewildering amount of characters. Dictionaries try to be comprehensive. Fortunately, most of these are only in historic use.</p>

<p>I wanted to remove the forest of irrelevant (for my purposes) characters and find get a list of ones actually worth investing time into.</p>

<p>I made this to get an overview and easily be able to answer questions like “how many common characters share this pronunciation?”.</p>

<p>I also wanted it to work without having to wait for a web page to load for each query. I made it work using a fully offline search (you download the data when loading the page itself).</p>

<h2 id="sources-and-data">Sources and data</h2>

<p>During my search I found this official list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a> made by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Sadly, this list is a rasterized PDF which does not even contain the pronunciation of these characters.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed like a good authoritative reference of commonly used characters. I started searching around and found a text version of it on <a href="http://xh.5156edu.com/page/z6211m4474j19255.html">this Chinese webpage</a>. While checking the data I found it had some mistakes around characters 3649 to 3668, which I had to fix manually.</p>

<p>To combine this with pronunciation data I found the <a href="ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/data/Uni2Pinyin.gz">Unicode Pinyin Table</a>. I’ve added numerouos pronunciations manually, when I found them missing from that source. I’ve logged my manual edits in <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt">edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt</a>. Note that since I’m only a basic Chinese speaker myself, I can’t exclude that there’s likely more mistakes. I’m open to using a more reliable source for pronunciation data if one is available.</p>

<p>Using this data I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv</a> files which are the source of the Hanzi search tool.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-make-this">How did I make this</h2>

<p>Originally I just used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> to search the hanzi-pinyin CSV files, but found it to become cumbersome due to the need to write regular expressions when I just wanted to think about pinyin.</p>

<p>I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/cnhz.py">cnhz</a> python script for myself, originally as a simple wrapper to build the grep regexes for me so I could just write pinyin. I then added more features around it.</p>

<p>As it got more useful I thought about how I could make it more accessible for other Chinese learners too. Most of them do not use Linux or have Python installed. I thought of rewriting it in Go to make it a single executable - but found the command line format would be awkward for most people. Also Windows cmd.exe does not support Chinese characters.</p>

<p>I eventually decided to turn it into a webpage. the CSV files were sufficiently small that the entire database could be loaded into the browser’s memory so you could do a completely client side search - making the experience much smoother than loading an online dictionary entry.</p>

<p>Also, because I can easily host it on my own web page, which I pay for anyway, I don’t have any need to add advertisements or anything to make the experience worse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the page can easily be downloaded and used offline by any learner in case my site goes down or for when you don’t have internet.</p>

<p>I tried to support offline working more by making the site into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">progressive web app</a>. However, while adding a manifest was easy, I found that to add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a> (which allows offline caching) - I would have to move all assets including a copy of my main CSS file to /cn/hanzi/. Not having time to figure this out at the moment, I decided to not add service workers for now.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://localhost:4000/js/hanzi_list.js">hanzi_list.js</a> file was generated from the CSV sources using an <code>awk</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt; ../files/hanzi-pinyin-full.csv \
    awk \
    'NR==1 { printf "const hanzi_3500 = \"" }
     NR==3501 { printf "\"; const hanzi_6500 = hanzi_3500 + \"" }
     { print NR","$0"\\n\\" }
     END { print "\";\nconst hanzi_6500_split = hanzi_6500.split(\"\\n\");" }' \
 &gt; ../js/hanzi_list.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you find my <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi">Chinese hanzi tool</a> useful. If you have any questions or want to contact me, see my details below.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Most of the time, to get root on an Android device you will use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a>. However, there may be cases where Magisk doesn't work or isn't ideal. For example, on IoT or embedded devices that don't have a traditional Android interface.</p><p>In these instances, it might be easiest to interact with the device through adb. Though more often than not adb runs as the lower privileged shell user, and the <code>adb root</code> command doesn't let you elevate permissions. It simply returns a <code>adbd cannot run as root in production builds</code> error.</p><p>If you search around the web you will find various advice telling you to add the <code>ro.debuggable=1</code> setting to the <code>default.prop</code> file, which is supposed to tell adbd it's allowed to run as root. This may work, but if it doesn't it's probably because the version of Android you're using wasn't compiled with the <code>ALLOW_ADBD_ROOT</code> flag, and the adbd code isn't configured to check the <code>ro.debuggable</code> setting.</p><p>Fortunately not all hope is lost. If all else fails, and you have the ability to upload a new boot partition to the device, you should be able to patch the adbd binary to run as root. Regardless of how the rest of the system has been configured.</p><p>Christian Weiske has a great <a href="https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/android-root-adb.htm">post</a> that introduced me to this concept. In my case, I just had to make a few modifications since the version of adbd I had was "newer" (Nougat), and I used a different method for modifying the boot image.</p><p>I'll assume you have already found a way to get a hold of the boot image. This process is highly dependent on the chipset, so you may need to Google around a bit.</p><p>The adbd binary is located in the <code>sbin</code> directory of the boot image. The easiest method I've found for extracting and modifying the boot image is with the <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/tools.html#magiskboot">magiskboot</a> tool. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/">latest Magisk release</a> zip archive. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to scroll down to find a recent Magisk release, it's not in the manager releases.</p><figure><pre><code>magiskboot unpack boot.img
magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio extract</code></pre><figcaption>Extracting the boot image and ramdisk</figcaption></figure><p>Download a copy of <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> 🐉, create a new project, and import the adbd binary you just extracted. Give it a minute or two to analyze all the code. (if you need Java, try <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html">Amazon's Corretto</a> or <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot">AdoptOpenJDK</a>)</p><p>I found it much easier to figure out what I was looking at by simultaneously reading the Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/tags/android-7.1.2_r39/adb/daemon/main.cpp">source code</a>. As Christian points out in his post, it's easiest to search for the <code>Local port disabled</code> string, or <code>0x7d0</code>, which is the shell user's id in hex. This should bring you to the part of the code where adbd switches from root to the shell user. The goal here is to "comment out" that code, so the program never stops running as root.</p><p>Below is the source code we are trying to target in Ghidra.</p><figure><pre><code>// Don't run as root if running in secure mode.
if (should_drop_privileges()) {
    drop_capabilities_bounding_set_if_needed();
    minijail_change_gid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    minijail_change_uid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    // minijail_enter() will abort if any priv-dropping step fails.
    minijail_enter(jail.get());
    D("Local port disabled");
}</code></pre><figcaption>Android source code</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 940w"><figcaption>Disassembled / decompiled code (function names renamed to improve readability)</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, we want to remove the calls to <code>minijail_change_gid</code> and <code>minijail_change_uid</code>. This can be done by replacing the bytes with a series of NOP / no operation commands (<code>00 BF</code>).</p><p>Hydra doesn't do a great job at directly modifying ARM binaries, but a generic hex editor should do the trick. I used <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>.</p><p>To remove the call to <code>minijail_change_gid</code>, find and replace the following series of bytes:</p><pre><code>4f f4 fa 61 2d f0 3e f9 &lt;- target
00 BF 00 BF 00 BF 00 BF &lt;- replaced with NOPs</code></pre><p>Do the same for <code>minijail_change_uid</code>, and save the patched binary.</p><p>You can use magiskboot to patch your ramdisk, and package up a new boot image. The repack command should create a <code>new-boot.img</code> file, that you can upload back to your Android device.</p><pre><code>magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio "add 750 sbin/adbd patched_adbd"
magiskboot repack boot.img</code></pre><p>Assuming all went well, adbd should be running as root!</p><p>Happy hacking 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week HashiCorp launched its <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint">latest open source project, Waypoint</a>. Waypoint is a tool to streamline the build, deploy, and release workflow for all kinds of applications. Where Terraform focuses on provisioning infrastructure, Waypoint focuses on application deployment.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting new deployment tool. In this post, we are going to take <code>waypoint</code> for a spin and see what it is like to use it.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before we can dive into <code>waypoint</code>, we need to have a few things set up. First, we are going to use Terraform to create our container image repository and ECS cluster in AWS. So make sure you have <code>terraform</code> configured, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">see these docs for details</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to have our AWS CLI configured. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">These docs show you how to get your CLI configured</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to install <code>waypoint</code>. This can be done a number of ways <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/downloads">as these docs mention</a>. If you’re on a Mac, you can run these two commands in <code>brew</code> to get it installed.</p>

$ brew <span>install</span> hashicorp/tap/waypoint</code></pre></div>
<h3>Setting up our Next.js demo application</h3>
<p>Before we can focus on deployment, we need an actual application to deploy. Let’s create a sample Next.js application that we can deploy via Waypoint.</p>
<p>We are going to make use of <code>create-next-app</code>. You can install it globally via <code>npm install -g create-next-app</code>. We will create our demo application based on the <code>with-typescript</code> example.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ yarn create next-app --example with-typescript waypoint-demo</code></pre></div>
<p>If we go into the <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory and run <code>yarn dev</code> we should have a functioning demo Next.js application living at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/du6usc371iyny233dv3o.png" alt="Next.js demo application"></p>
<h3>Setting up our Terraform &amp; Waypoint structure</h3>
<p>With our prerequisites out of the way and a demo application to deploy, let’s set up our configuration for Terraform and Waypoint. From the <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory, run the <code>init</code> command via <code>waypoint</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ waypoint init</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome, we should now see a <code>waypoint.hcl</code> file inside of our <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory.</p>
<p>Waypoint also makes use of a server that you run locally in order for the CLI and GUI to work. This is a bit clunky at the moment but we need to do the following two things to run the Waypoint server locally.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker pull hashicorp/waypoint:latest
$ waypoint <span>install</span> --platform<span>=</span>docker -accept-tos
✓ Server container started
Waypoint server successfully installed and configured<span>!</span>

The CLI has been configured to connect to the server automatically. This
connection information is saved <span>in</span> the CLI context named <span>"install-1602801878"</span><span>.</span>
Use the <span>"waypoint context"</span> CLI to manage CLI contexts.

The server has been configured to advertise the following address <span>for</span>
entrypoint communications. This must be a reachable address <span>for</span> all your
deployments. If this is incorrect, manually <span>set</span> it using the CLI <span>command</span>
<span>"waypoint server config-set"</span><span>.</span>

Advertise Address: waypoint-server:9701
HTTP UI Address: localhost:9702</code></pre></div>
<p>The latter step launches the Waypoint server locally using Docker.</p>
<p>Next up, we need a directory to hold our Terraform configuration and state. Create a new folder in <code>waypoint-demo</code> called <code>infrastructure</code> and add a file called <code>versions.tf</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ <span>mkdir</span> infrastructure
$ <span>cd</span> infrastructure
$ <span>touch</span> versions.tf</code></pre></div>
<p>Great, we now have a place to land both our Waypoint and Terraform configuration.</p>
<h3>Creating our infrastructure with Terraform</h3>
<p>We are going to use Terraform to define the infrastructure for our application. In the context of this blog post, that means our AWS resources that our Next.js application is going to run on. For this post, we are going to use AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) to run our application.</p>
<p>To do that we first need to provision a new ECS cluster in our AWS account. So we are going to add the following to our <code>versions.tf</code> file inside of our <code>infrastructure</code> folder.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>terraform {
  required_version = "&gt;= 0.13"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "nextjs-cluster" {
  name = "waypoint-nextjs-cluster"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This will use the AWS provider in Terraform to provision a new ECS cluster in our account with the name <code>waypoint-nextjs-cluster</code>. Let’s go ahead and run <code>terraform apply</code> to provision our cluster.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo/infrastructure
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

          + value <span>=</span> <span>(</span>known after apply<span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only <span>'yes'</span> will be accepted to approve.

<p>💪 We now have our AWS ECS cluster that we are going to run our application in. Next up we need a container image registry for Waypoint to publish to. We can use AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for that.</p>
<p>We can add an ECR resource to our Terraform configuration in <code>versions.tf</code>. Add the following resource to the bottom of that file.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>resource "aws_ecr_repository" "nextjs-image-repo" {
  name = "nextjs-image"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>We can run <code>terraform apply</code> one more time to create our image repository.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ terraform apply

<h3>Using Waypoint to deploy our application</h3>
<p>Now that we have the AWS resources we need to run our Next.js app, let’s deploy it using Waypoint!</p>
<p>To leverage <code>waypoint</code> we need to add our configuration to <code>waypoint.hcl</code>. We are going to focus on building our Next.js app as a container image and deploying it to our running ECS cluster.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and add the following to our <code>waypoint.hcl</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>project = "example-next-ecs"

app "next-ecs" {
  build {
    use "pack" {}
    # Use ECR docker registry provisioned via infrastructure/versions.tf
    registry {
      use "aws-ecr" {
        region     = "us-west-2"
        repository = "nextjs-image"
        tag        = "latest"
      }
    }

  }

  # Deploy to ECS
  deploy {
    use "aws-ecs" {
      cluster = "waypoint-nextjs-cluster"
      region  = "us-west-2"
      memory  = "512"
    }
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>What in the world are we doing here?</p>
<p>First, we define an <code>app</code> for Waypoint, <code>next-ecs</code>. Inside of our app, we then define a build step and a deploy step. With our <code>build</code> step we are making use of <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> plugin via the <code>use "pack" {}</code> block. This is in favor of using Docker, but Docker is supported inside of Waypoint as well. We then define our <code>registry</code> block. This is used by the <code>build</code> step in Waypoint to push the built container image to a remote repository. This remote repository is the ECR repository we provisioned via Terraform.</p>
<p>Inside of the <code>deploy</code> block we make use of the <code>aws-ecs</code> plugin for Waypoint. Here we specify the ECS cluster we want to deploy our container to. Again, this is the cluster we provisioned earlier via Terraform. We also specify the <code>memory</code> we want our container to have, <code>512 MB</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what is going on, let’s deploy it. We first need to initialize Waypoint and then we can run the <code>up</code> command.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ waypoint init
$ waypoint up

<p>The team only has to answer 2 questions in Sprint Planning, but they’re big ones:</p>



<ol><li>What can we do in this sprint?</li><li>How are we going to do it?</li></ol>



<p>Only the Development Team can answer those 2 questions<strong>.</strong> Nobody else can tell them how much work they can do, or how they should do it. Therefore, <strong>the Development Team <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/08/becoming-a-leader-the-hard-and-only-way/">leads</a> sprint planning</strong></p>



<p>First the whole team works together to <strong>create the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/07/scrums-sprint-goal-vs-mishmash-sprints/">Sprint Goal</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, the Development Team <strong>moves tickets one by one</strong> from the top of the prioritized <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/03/backlogs-are-not-idea-buckets/">Product Backlog</a> into the Sprint Backlog. They stop when they feel like the Sprint is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">full enough</a>.</p>



<p>After that, the Development Team <strong>self organizes around the work</strong> and <strong>creates <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">a plan for the sprint</a></strong>. This is where they discuss parallel vs. sequential work, or decompose tickets that are too big, etc.</p>



<p>Voila! That’s a planned Sprint! </p>



<p><em>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning">Scrum Guide section on Sprint Planning</a>.</em></p>



<h3 id="Antipatterns:">Anti-patterns:</h3>



<ol><li><em>Sprint Planning shouldn’t be led by anyone besides the Development Team. </em>Not the Scrum Master, not the Product Owner, not the PM. It’s harder for the Development Team to take ownership of their work if they aren’t leading the discussion.</li><li><em>Sprint Planning shouldn’t gather a collection of unrelated tickets for the Sprint</em>. As much as possible, tickets should all relate to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/07/scrums-sprint-goal-vs-mishmash-sprints/">the single Sprint Goal</a> so that people can work together towards a single iteration.</li><li><em>Sprints should never be pre-planned before Sprint Planning starts</em>. The Sprint Backlog should be empty when Sprint Planning starts, so there’s no hidden pressure to commit to a pre-planned sprint. I’m talking to you, Product Owner who puts tickets into “sprint buckets” before Sprint Planning.</li></ol>

You need to set up a website, but your product partner is already behind on features so that leaves it solely up to you. What's your plan? Given the tight budget and schedule, the disciplined move would be to quickly use a template in an inexpensive website builder. You can graduate to something a little more custom once you have more resources and your brand, positioning, and voice figured out.</span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8903"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8904"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8904:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">Sounds like a good plan, but anyone who's gone down this path knows it's never as simple as it seems.</span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8907"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8908"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8908:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">For one, the template never lasts as long as you need it to. You realize the design isn't working, or your competitor just unexpectedly made a move. So you start trying to make changes. Swapping out the text and images comes easy, but as soon as you start adjusting the layout, frustration begins to set in. You've got a million other things to do and for some reason you can't get the page to look right on mobile. </span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8911"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8912"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8912:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">As it turns out, the same features and guard rails that made it easy to stand up the template have now become the reason it's hard to iterate.

Despite its many shortcomings around bulk management, a surprising number of customers were willing to put in extra manual work to build and maintain full websites. The reason? Our user experience was actually designed for them—intelligent and tech-savvy generalists who wanted to break free from the template without having to go get a degree.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>In this post I want to discuss an issue that I, being for a longer time in IT meanwhile, observe over and over again. It is the observation that as an industry we continuously forget what we have learned.</p>
<p>What do I mean with that claim?</p>
<h2 id="the-very-first-discussion----again-and-again-and-">The very first discussion – again and again and …</h2>
<p>Probably I best illustrate this by sharing an experience I had. About two years ago I attended an unconference. It was not the first time I attended it. I liked it a lot. It always had a very energetic atmosphere. The participants were very active, loved to share and discuss. But unlike the previous times, I decided to do something different that year.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I decided not to share myself, not to offer sessions myself where I drive the topic of discussion, but to listen only. I know that this is not the idea of an unconference, but I was curious. As I wrote: It was a little experiment, I wanted to conduct.</p>
<p>I knew that always a very active group of people gathered at this unconference and I wanted to use that as an unbiased opportunity to learn about the state of IT, how people think about topics, what moves them, and so on. So, I looked forward to what I would learn.</p>
<p>To be frank, it was a devastating experience for me.</p>
<p>The session that really killed it was a session about <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">reusability</a>. A group of people came together to discuss reusability. I was really curious as I dealt with the topic for many years already. A great community. A topic I am particularly interested in. I was looking forward to learning something new. I did not expect a lot of new ideas, but maybe one or two.</p>
<p>So, I listened … and could not believe what I heard.</p>
<p>The discussion moved at a level as if nobody ever had said or written a single word about reusability in the past 50 years. I felt set back to a pre-1968 discussion, set back to a time before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Software_Engineering_Conferences">NATO Software Engineering Conferences</a> were held. Where had all the ideas about reusability from the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s and all the years after gone?</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody in the room ever had heard anything about what we as an industry already had figured out about reusability. They discussed the topic completely from scratch, and due to that in a totally naive way, not touching any of the important learning of the last 50 years. I sat there listening and did not understand what happened. I felt the urge to jump up and scream: “Shut up, all of you! You do not know sh*t about reusability!”</p>
<p>Of course, I did not. Besides the fact that it would have been very rude, it also would have been unfair.</p>
<p>As I wrote before: It was a very active community that gathered there, all of them adding with their best intentions to a vibrant discussion. So, I eventually decided to leave. Not all sessions felt as devastating as this one but I had similar experiences in most of the sessions I attended.</p>
<p>I was quite confused and had a lot to ponder. I went to the conference to learn something new and … well, I learned something new. But it was definitely not what I expected to learn. I learned that the people in the sessions I attended did not seem to have any knowledge about the discussions that we had before in our industry about the very topics.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-collective-amnesia">Continuous collective amnesia</h2>
<p>What happened? It kept me a while thinking. Eventually, I realized that I had observed a disease of our whole industry in its purest form: We continuously forget what we have learned. We always reinvent everything from scratch. My personal observation is that discussions in the IT community start over about every 5 years <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That is how long we remember as a community. After that we need to rediscover your insights from scratch.</p>
<p>Or how I like to phrase it in a bit provocative way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In IT, we suffer from continuous collective amnesia and we are even proud of it! <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is not about the people who discussed in that room. All of them did their best, they eagerly discussed hoping to gather new insights. They were simply victims of a widespread disease in IT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not value the wisdom of the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suffer from extreme youth obsession, not only regarding the age of people but also regarding how we value knowledge. Old knowledge is considered “worthless”, while new knowledge is considered “great”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitmenStudios/status/1263070511812227072">tweet</a> that Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios sent me in a little conversion we had via Twitter IMO really nicely describes the effect:</p>
<p><img src="https://ufried.com/blog/continuous_amnesia_issue/continuous_amnesia.png" alt="Tweet from Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios: My point here is rather not searching for a unique “best” solution but everywhere software devs across the globe are solving the “same” problem again and again (and fall into the same pitfalls). The increase in tech needed and the associated complexity amplifies that problem." title="We solve the same problems again and again"></p>
<p>We reinvent the wheel over and over again, making the same mistakes again and again, not learning as a community. And as Mark correctly pointed out, the growing technology complexity amplifies the problem – and, as I would like to add, vice versa: Our continuous collective amnesia amplifies our <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">growing complexity problem</a>.</p>
<p>Why is it this way? Why do we loose our collective memory every 5 years?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the causes. My current attempt of an explanation consists of 5 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>We consider ourselves a dynamic, fast moving industry. New concepts, tools and technologies emerge every day. How can knowledge of yesterday still be applicable to problems of today? That is what we keep telling ourselves. We wallow in our perceived vigor and speed of innovation, neglecting that we keep solving the same problems over and over again, just with different tools and technologies. Yes, some things change, but usually 80%+ of the problems stay the same. But we refuse to see that. We prefer considering ourselves the “masters of new”.</li>
<li>We are technology believers. We are convinced that we can solve any problem by simply applying the right tool or technology. E.g., if people have a collaboration problem, the typical reflex is to look for a tool that solves the problem, neglecting that it almost certainly is not a tool problem. The same is true for all other kinds of problems. Whenever we face a non-trivial problem, we try to solve it by applying a tool or technology to it instead of solving the actual problem. This has become such a natural pattern that we do not realize it anymore. And as past tools and technologies did not solve the problem, we look for new ones.</li>
<li>Insights grow slower than knowledge. Our knowledge continuously grows, the longer we work in IT. Of course, not everything we learn is valuable. Quite often we learn that some of our knowledge is plain crap. If I, e.g., think back to SOA: Wow, what a crap! Would never do it again this way! But not everything was bad. I also took some great insights from the SOA times. It takes times to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the beginning of our careers we basically learn new stuff all the time. It takes some years until we start to see the recurring patterns, to separate real insights from plain knowledge.</li>
<li>We face a continuous stream of new developers. I feel as if I face a new generation of developers every 5 years <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Maybe that is a very subjective experience. But for me, people just coming from their IT education, being 5 years in business, 10 years or 15 years and more feel very different, like different generations. All those new people in IT have to build their own insights from scratch. They have nothing to build on as in IT we created a cult(ure) of new, celebrating the new and despising the old.</li>
<li>If you combine the “cult of new” with what I call “the arrogance of the youth”, you get an explosive mixture. Before you think that I want to talk bad about younger people: I just talk from personal experience. I was a graduate myself years ago and believe me: I was arrogant! I knew better! I had to learn humbleness the hard way, and I am still not sure if I arrived (it is a lot easier to judge an old self than to judge the current self). So, I do not want to reproach any young person for being somewhat arrogant. I guess that is natural and also healthy to a certain degree because it helps against persisting in outdated ideas as an industry. But in a culture of new, this habit works as an unhealthy accelerant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put these factors together, we end up with an environment where we only value new things and despise old things. If we face a problem, we never look if someone solved the same problem before <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We only look for a shiny new solution, ideally a new tool or technology. If we learn a good solution for a problem, we forget it after a few years and start again from scratch.</p>
<p>It is not that individuals do not learn and do not grow insights. They do.</p>
<p>But as a community, we do not.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering disciplines, we do not create our body of knowledge, foster our timeless insights, work to extract the essence from the solutions we found yesterday and make it available to the community of today. We do not only not create a body of knowledge, we despise it. We always look to the horizon hoping to spot a silver bullet (which does not exist as we know) instead of looking back once in a while and trying to learn from the wisdom of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>This is what I observe all the time. Again, this does not mean that I do not meet individuals who act differently. But in general, I see the same discussions recurring again and again about every 5 years.</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have an actual idea how to change this. This cult of new is so deeply embedded in our culture and self-perception that it would take a long time and effort to change it.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to share some of the old wisdom, e.g., with my talk <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ufried/excavating-the-knowledge-of-our-ancestors">“Excavating the knowledge of the ancestors”</a>. There is also the <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">“Papers We Love”</a> movement that tries to share such knowledge.</p>
<p>But overall this is just a drop in the ocean. It would require a radical rethinking to stop our continuous collective amnesia. We would need to accept that most of our problems are not new, but that most of the times we solve the same problems again and again, just with different technology.</p>
<p>But until we learn this, I am afraid we are not yet an engineering discipline, but rather a bunch of people obsessed with “new”, not learning.</p>
<p>As so often, there would be a lot more to write. But I leave it here. I hope I gave you something to …</p></div></div>

The basic configuration block is IAM policies, which contain statements that grant/deny permissions.</p> <p>The first step IAM does is it <strong>constructs a request context</strong> which contains all the details, such as who is making the request (the Principal), what is the action (Action), and on which resource (Resource), along with a bunch of others metadata, such as the IP address, whether the identity is authenticated with MFA, and several other things. The exact parameters are unfortunately not visible, and the only available resource is the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html#context_keys_table">reference documentation</a>. This makes it more of a trial-and-error to get some insight into the values for a request.</p> <p>Thinking of requests as lists of name-value pairs helps understanding how policy statements match them.</p> <p>In the next step, IAM <strong>collects all the statements that match the request context</strong>. Each statement has a set of <strong>filters</strong>, in the form of the <code>Action</code>, <code>Principal</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and <code>Condition</code> properties. The statements that match the request context will be included in the <em>policy evaluation logic</em>.</p> <p>Whether the request is allowed or denied depends on the <em>type</em> of matching statements and their <code>Effect</code>s. The two most important policy types are resource- and identity-based policies, as all the others (SCP, permissions boundary, session policy) are for specific use-cases and they are <em>optional</em> in the evaluation flow.</p> <p>The decision for most resources follow this process:</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:466px;height:514px" viewBox="0 0

Access Control, or ABAC for short) can use tags defined for the principal. This makes a highly scalable permission scheme, as adding and removing tags from resources and identities grants and removes the permissions instead of having to modify the policies attached to them.</p> <p>Let’s see an example where the user has an <code>access=restricted</code> tag attached, and a policy that allows reading objects with the same tag!</p> <p><svg

It’s easy to see how it doesn’t when the two values are different.</p> <h2 id="restricted-resources">Restricted resources</h2> <p>In the S3 bucket example, either the identity- or the resource-based policy is enough to give access. This is the case for most resource types, but there are exceptions. An <strong>IAM role’s trust policy</strong> needs to allow the action explicitly, it’s not enough that the identity policy allows it.</p> <p>The resource policy can allow in two ways. It can allow the user explicitly, such as <code>"Principal": "&lt;iam&gt;/user"</code>. In this case, the operation is allowed and there is no need for an identity policy. This is how it works for less strict resources.</p> <p>The other way is to allow <em>the account</em> in the form of <code>"Principal": "arn:aws:iam::&lt;accountid&gt;:root"</code>. This delegates access control to the identity policies to decide. If a trust policy does not allow either the requesting identity or the account then the request is denied.</p> <p>This is how the policy evaluation flow looks like for these resources:</p> <p><svg

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

<p>Any database schema is likely to have plenty of text fields. In this article, I divide text fields into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small texts</strong>: names, slugs, usernames, emails, etc. These are text fields that usually have some low size limit, maybe even using <code>varchar(n)</code> and not <code>text</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large texts</strong>: blog post content, articles, HTML content etc. These are large pieces of free, unrestricted text that is stored in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium texts</strong>: descriptions, comments, product reviews, stack traces etc. These are any text field that is between the small and the large. These type of texts would normally be unrestricted, but naturally smaller than the large texts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In this article I demonstrate the surprising impact of medium-size texts on query performance in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-toast"><a href="#understanding-toast">Understanding TOAST</a></h2>
<p>When talking about large chunks of text, or any other field that may contain large amounts of data, we first need to understand how the database handles the data. Intuitively, you might think that the database is storing large pieces of data inline like it does smaller pieces of data, but in fact, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html" rel="noopener">it does not</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store very large field values directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the documentation explains, PostgreSQL can't store rows (tuples) in multiple pages. So how does the database store large chunks of data?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] large field values are compressed and/or broken up into multiple physical rows. [...] The technique is affectionately known as TOAST (or “the best thing since sliced bread”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so how is this TOAST working exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any of the columns of a table are TOAST-able, the table will have an associated TOAST table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So TOAST is a separate table associated with our table. It is used to store large pieces of data of TOAST-able columns (the <code>text</code> datatype for example, is TOAST-able).</p>
<p>What constitutes a large value?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TOAST management code is triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than TOAST_TUPLE_THRESHOLD bytes (normally 2 kB). The TOAST code will compress and/or move field values out-of-line until the row value is shorter than TOAST_TUPLE_TARGET bytes (also normally 2 kB, adjustable) or no more gains can be had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL will try to compress a the large values in the row, and if the row can't fit within the limit, the values will be stored out-of-line in the TOAST table.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-toast"><a href="#finding-the-toast">Finding the TOAST</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <em>some</em> understanding of what TOAST is, let's see it in action. First, create a table with a text field:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table contains an id column, and a value field of type <code>TEXT</code>. Notice that we did not change any of the default storage parameters.</p>
<p>The text field we added supports TOAST, or is TOAST-able, so PostgreSQL should create a TOAST table. Let's try to locate the TOAST table associated with the table <code>toast_test</code> in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html" rel="noopener"><code>pg_class</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span><span>,</span> <span>reltoastrelid</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'toast_test'</span><span>;</span>
<span>  relname   │ reltoastrelid</span>
<span>────────────┼───────────────</span>
<span> toast_test │        340488</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>oid</span> <span>=</span> <span>340488</span><span>;</span>
<span>     relname</span>
<span>─────────────────</span>
<span> pg_toast_340484</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As promised, PostgreSQL created a TOAST table called <code>pg_toast_340484</code>.</p>
<h3 id="toast-in-action"><a href="#toast-in-action">TOAST in Action</a></h3>
<p>Let's see what the TOAST table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\d</span> <span>pg_toast.pg_toast_340484</span>
<span>TOAST table "pg_toast.pg_toast_340484"</span>
<span>   Column   │  Type</span>
<span>────────────┼─────────</span>
<span> chunk_id   │ oid</span>
<span> chunk_seq  │ integer</span>
<span> chunk_data │ bytea</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The TOAST table contains three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk_id</code>: A reference to a toasted value.</li>
<li><code>chunk_seq</code>: A sequence within the chunk.</li>
<li><code>chunk_data</code>: The actual chunk data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to "regular" tables, the TOAST table also has the same restrictions on inline values. To overcome this restriction, large values are split into chunks that can fit within the limit.</p>
<p>At this point the table is empty:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes sense because we did not insert any data yet. So next, insert a small value into the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'small value'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After inserting the small value into the table, the TOAST table remained empty. This means the small value was small enough to be stored inline, and there was no need to move it out-of-line to the TOAST table.</p>

<p>Let's insert a large value and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'n0cfPGZOCwzbHSMRaX8 ... WVIlRkylYishNyXf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I shortened the value for brevity, but that's a random string with 4096 characters. Let's see what the TOAST table stores now:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>

<span>   995899 │         2 │ \x6c78426358574534...</span>
<span>(3 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The large value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table. Because the value was too large to fit inline in a single row, PostgreSQL split it into three chunks. The <code>\x3063...</code> notation is how psql displays binary data.</p>

<p>Finally, execute the following query to summarize the data in the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>

<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>   995899 │      3 │ 4096 bytes</span>
<span>(1 row)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As we've already seen, the text is stored in three chunks.</p>
<div>
<p>size of database objects</p>
<p>There are several ways to get the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE" rel="noopener">size of database objects in PostgreSQL</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pg_table_size</code>: Get the size of the table including TOAST, but excluding indexes</li>
<li><code>pg_relation_size</code>: Get the size of just the table</li>
<li><code>pg_total_relation_size</code>: Get the size of the table, including indexes and TOAST</li>
</ul>
<p>Another useful function is <code>pg_size_pretty</code>: used to display sizes in a friendly format.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toast-compression"><a href="#toast-compression">TOAST Compression</a></h3>
<p>So far I refrained from categorizing texts by their size. The reason for that is that the size of the text itself does not matter, what matters is its size after compression.</p>
<p>To create long strings for testing, we'll implement a function to generate random strings at a given length:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span>

<p>Generate a string made out of 10 random characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span> generate_random_string</span>
<span>────────────────────────</span>
<span> o0QsrMYRvp</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can also provide a set of characters to generate the random string from. For example, generate a string made of 10 random digits:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'1234567890'</span><span>);</span>
<span> generate_random_string</span>
<span>────────────────────────</span>
<span> 4519991669</span>
</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL TOAST uses the <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/pg__lzcompress_8c_source.html" rel="noopener">LZ family of compression</a> techniques. Compression algorithms usually work by identifying and eliminating repetition in the value. A long string containing fewer characters should compress very well compared to a string made of many different characters when encoded into bytes.</p>
<p>To illustrate how TOAST uses compression, we'll clean out the <code>toast_test</code> table, and insert a random string made of many possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>TRUNCATE</span> <span>toast_test</span><span>;</span>
<span>TRUNCATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10kb value made of random characters. Let's check the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table, and we can see it is not compressed.</p>
<p>Next, insert a value with a similar length, but made out of fewer possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10K value, but this time it only contained 3 possible digits: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. This text is more likely to contain repeating binary patterns, and should compress better than the previous value. Looking at the TOAST, we can see PostgreSQL compressed the value to ~3kB, which is a third of the size of the uncompressed value. Not a bad compression rate!</p>
<p>Finally, insert a 10K long string made of a single digit:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'0'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The string was compressed so well, that the database was able to store it in-line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Binary lambda calculus</b> (<b>BLC</b>) is a minimal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional" title="Purely functional">pure</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language" title="Functional programming language">functional programming language</a> invented by John Tromp in 2004,<sup id="cite_ref-RAC_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RAC-1">[1]</a></sup> based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_encoding" title="Binary encoding">binary encoding</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untyped_lambda_calculus" title="Untyped lambda calculus">untyped lambda calculus</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index" title="De Bruijn index">De Bruijn index</a> notation.</p>



<h2><span id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>BLC is designed to provide a very simple and elegant concrete definition of descriptional complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>).</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the complexity of an object is the length of its shortest description.</p>
<p>To make this precise, we take descriptions to be bitstrings, and identify a description method with some computational device, or machine, that transforms descriptions into objects. Objects are usually also just bitstrings, but can have additional structure as well, e.g., pairs of strings.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="Turing machine">Turing machines</a>, the most well known formalism for computation, were used for this purpose. But they are somewhat lacking in ease of construction and composability. Another classical computational formalism, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" title="Lambda calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, offers distinct advantages in ease of use. The lambda calculus doesn't incorporate any notion of I/O though, so one needs to be designed.</p>
<h2><span id="Binary_I.2FO">Binary I/O</span></h2>
<p>Adding a readbit primitive function to lambda calculus, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin" title="Chaitin">Chaitin</a> did for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP" title="LISP">LISP</a>, would destroy its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)" title="Referential transparency (computer science)">referential transparency</a>, unless one distinguishes between an I/O action and its result, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" title="Haskell (programming language)">Haskell</a> does with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)" title="Monad (functional programming)">monadic</a> I/O. But that requires a type system, an unnecessary complication.</p>
<p>Instead, BLC requires translating bitstrings into lambda terms, to which the machine (itself a lambda term) can be readily applied.</p>
<p>Bits 0 and 1 are translated into the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates" title="Lambda calculus">lambda booleans</a> <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= True and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= False:</p>

<p>The <i>z</i> works as a list continuation, that could be a nil list (to end the string) or another string (that would be appended to the original string).</p>
<h2><span id="Delimited_versus_undelimited">Delimited versus undelimited</span></h2>
<p>Descriptional complexity actually comes in two distinct flavors, depending on whether the input is considered to be delimited.</p>
<p>Knowing the end of your input makes it easier to describe objects. For instance, you can just copy the whole input to output. This flavor is called <i>plain</i> or <i>simple</i> complexity.</p>
<p>But in a sense it is additional information. A file system for instance needs to separately store the length of files. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character" title="Null character">null character</a> to denote the end of a string, but this comes at the cost of not having that character available within strings.</p>
<p>The other flavor is called <i>prefix</i> complexity, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code" title="Prefix code">prefix codes</a>, where the machine needs to figure out, from the input read so far, whether it needs to read more bits. We say that the input is self-delimiting. This works better for communication channels, since one can send multiple descriptions, one after the other, and still tell them apart.</p>
<p>In the I/O model of BLC, the flavor is dictated by the choice of <i>z</i>. If we keep it as a free variable, and demand that it appears as part of the output, then the machine must be working in a self-delimiting manner. If on the other hand we use a lambda term specifically designed to be easy to distinguish from any pairing, then the input becomes delimited. BLC chooses <i>False</i> for this purpose but gives it the more descriptive alternative name of <i>Nil</i>. Dealing with lists that may be Nil is straightforward: since</p>

</dl>
<p>one can write functions <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> to deal with the two cases, the only caveat being that <i>N</i> will be passed to <i>M</i> as its third argument.</p>
<h2><span id="Universality">Universality</span></h2>
<p>We can find a description method <i>U</i> such that for any other description method <i>D</i>, there is a constant <i>c</i> (depending only on <i>D</i>) such that no object takes more than <i>c</i> extra bits to describe with method <i>U</i> than with method <i>D</i>. And BLC is designed to make these constants relatively small. In fact the constant will be the length of a binary encoding of a <i>D</i>-interpreter written in BLC, and <i>U</i> will be a lambda term that parses this encoding and runs this decoded interpreter on the rest of the input. <i>U</i> won't even have to know whether the description is delimited or not; it works the same either way.</p>
<p>Having already solved the problem of translating bitstrings into lambda calculus, we now face the opposite problem: how to encode lambda terms into bitstrings?</p>
<h2><span id="Lambda_encoding">Lambda encoding</span></h2>
<p>First we need to write our lambda terms in a particular notation using what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_indices" title="De Bruijn indices">De Bruijn indices</a>. Our encoding is then defined recursively as follows</p>

<p>A <b>closed</b> lambda term is one in which all variables are bound, i.e. without any free variables. In De Bruijn format, this means that an index <i>i</i> can only appear within at least <i>i</i> nested lambdas. The number of closed terms of size <i>n</i> bits is given by sequence <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences" title="OEIS"><img alt="OEIS" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/11px-OEISicon_light.svg.png" width="11" height="15" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/17px-OEISicon_light.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/22px-OEISicon_light.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="409" data-file-height="556"></a>â€Š<a href="https://oeis.org/A114852" title="oeis:A114852">A114852</a></span> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences" title="On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>

<p>In March, as Covid-19 began sending office workers home across the globe, Facebook realized it had a serious problem. The company relies on a vast army of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">content moderators</a><strong> </strong>— often low-paid contractors — who are responsible for removing everything from nudity to hate speech and terrorism content. Their work is often sensitive and, therefore, can’t be done outside a formal office. As the world went into lockdown, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf">said</a> during a press call that the social network would lean more on full-time staffers and artificial intelligence to police its platforms.</p>



<p>But, he noted, some of this work would “still be done by teams in person.” One of those teams is located thousands of miles away from the company’s California headquarters in Hyderabad, India, where, as of last year, <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-facebook-contractor-genpact-doubles-minimum-salaries-for-content-moderators-in-india-report/">1,600 Facebook moderators</a> were employed by a third-party contractor called Genpact. This summer, even as Covid-19 cases were surging in India, Genpact moderators said they felt pressured by their employer to come back to the office. While most of Facebook’s full-time employees remain safe at home, these workers have been forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods: stemming the tide of the most unsavory and disturbing posts on the internet.</p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>spoke with four current and former Genpact employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the company. They said moderators were asked — in some cases as early as July — to return to the office to tackle sensitive content, including posts involving child exploitation, suicide, and other matter that could lead to real-world harm. Two moderators said that Genpact pressured workers to show up at Facebook’s office in HITEC City, a corporate district home to some of India’s biggest tech companies. Two moderators also reported that Genpact is continuing to shift more employees to work on Facebook content.</p>



<p>In a statement, Genpact said it couldn’t comment on specific relationships with clients, but it asserted that moderators are being asked to come into the office on only a volunteer basis. “To make this manageable, safe, and clear, employees need to sign a weekly form that asks them to voluntarily agree to this,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook also asserted that moderators are working in person only if they choose the option and that most are still doing their jobs from home. “Our focus for reopening any office is on how it can be done in a way that keeps our reviewers safe,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in a statement. “To do this we are putting strict health and safety measures in place, making sure they’re followed, and addressing and disclosing any confirmed cases of illness.”</p>



<p>With few opportunities for other work, the moderators who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> said they still felt like they had no choice but to show up in person. A senior moderator said that Genpact employees were also informed they could lose their jobs if they didn’t come to the office. “The operations team told them these are important orders,” said the moderator. “There’s a threatening factor behind [it].”</p>



<p>“People are forced to go to work, even if they are not happy to,” they added. Genpact denied that it incentivizes anyone to work in person. The company emphasized that coming into the office “is voluntary, and we remind each employee that their decision has no impact on benefits, pay, or status.” </p>



<p>In the middle of a pandemic and subsequent recession, it’s not clear where the Genpact moderators would go if they lost their jobs. “During Covid times, many companies are holding off on new recruitments,” said R. Chandra Sekharam, a commissioner with the Labour Department of Telangana, the Indian state where Hyderabad is located.</p>



<p>In March, an IT company that shares an office building with Facebook made a grim announcement: one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Fears of contracting Covid-19 soon swept the city. Hostel owners and other landlords in Hyderabad, afraid that tenants working in large offices would bring the virus home with them, began evicting people who work in business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to two Genpact moderators, that included some of their colleagues working for Facebook. When they reached out to Genpact asking for help finding a new place to live, one employee said the plea fell on deaf ears. “There’s no help being given by the company,” they told <em>Rest of World</em>. Genpact denied the claim and said it worked with authorities to stop evictions and offered some people alternative housing.</p>





<p>Just two days after that first case of Covid-19 was announced, Genpact employees were asked to return to work in Facebook’s office, according to one moderator who was called back. In May, the<em> </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/18/facebook-google-work-from-home/"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em> </em>reported that Facebook had offered extra pay to moderators in the U.S. who voluntarily agreed to return to work. The Genpact workers told <em>Rest of World</em> that no such bonus was extended to them in India.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the moderators said that their salaries, which amount to less than $2 an hour, were supplemented by food benefits, received either in the form of in-office meals or through a prepaid meal card. One moderator described the perk as coming directly from Facebook. But when Genpact employees were sent home during India’s Covid-19 lockdown, the benefit disappeared. During an internal Facebook meeting leaked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"><em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>in September, Zuckerberg fielded a question from a staffer at the company’s California headquarters, who complained about the lack of free snacks available while they worked from home. But for reviewers in India, meal benefits were more than just a cushy perk: They were a crucial supplement to their low incomes. (Genpact says that it is continuing to provide packed meals and snacks for on-site workers.)</p>

<p>Moderators who have returned to Facebook’s office in Hyderabad say they are unhappy but also afraid of losing their jobs. “Calling people in [to work] in such situations is completely unprofessional,” one former moderator told <em>Rest of World</em>. That person left Genpact after being sent home in March but remains in contact with former coworkers. “Genpact is doing it because there aren’t any jobs, and people are getting laid off. So people are too scared to actually say anything. And I think that’s what Genpact is taking advantage of.”</p>



<p>Contractors, unlike Facebook’s full-time employees, have almost no leverage to demand changes to their working conditions, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Despite accounting for a core part of Facebook’s business, contract moderators “are viewed as replaceable cogs in a machine,” he says.</p>



<p>Facebook has also been criticized for its treatment of domestic content moderators. In May, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/854998616/in-settlement-facebook-to-pay-52-million-to-content-moderators-with-ptsd">$52 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit filed by reviewers in the U.S., who alleged the traumatic nature of their work led to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Facebook admitted no wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the company vowed to improve labor conditions. Yet contractors have continued to report problems, particularly during the pandemic. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported that Facebook moderators at the third-party firm Accenture said they were ordered to report to their offices in Austin, Texas, without any explanation or extra pay. (Facebook said the work done by the Austin team can’t be done from home.)</p>



<p>Mithun Roy, a managing consultant at the outsourcing firm Avaya, says that companies like Genpact can charge more for employees who work directly from a client’s office than from an outsourcing site. When clients like Facebook request a firm’s services, Roy says they have to be as detailed as possible, including disclosing where the work will be performed. According to Roy, a yearlong contract from a client like Facebook can be worth millions of dollars.</p>



<p>“Management doesn’t want to miss this opportunity,” the senior Genpact moderator told<em> Rest of World</em>. That person said the company has been pushing moderators to work on-site at Facebook’s Hyderabad office even as Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed in the city, in order to gain an advantage over competitors less comfortable sending workers in person. “Even after the pandemic ends, this could [mean] new workstreams for us,” the senior moderator said.</p>



<p>Genpact and Facebook aren’t the only entities pushing contractors in Hyderabad to return to normal. The city’s economy is increasingly reliant on business from multinational tech companies. It’s been home to Microsoft’s regional headquarters since 1998, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/amazon-hyderabad-india.html">the largest Amazon office</a> in the world opened there last year. As the pandemic progressed, and many workers left the city for their hometowns, officials began fearing that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/lay-offs-loom-over-it-sector-in-hyderabad-telangana-govt-urges-centre-to-act-11588317514170.html">Hyderabad’s tech industry would soon experience massive layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Hyderabad went into lockdown on March 22. Officials began allowing <a href="https://qz.com/india/1834746/some-tcs-infosys-wipro-staff-go-to-work-amid-coronavirus/">IT workers to return to the office less than two months later on May 1</a>, and some even sooner. During India’s lockdown and subsequent reopening, IT companies were considered “essential” by the government, allowing them to skirt certain coronavirus regulations placed on other businesses. According to a state minister in Hyderabad, this designation predates the pandemic: It’s meant as a guarantee to multinational companies that their outsourced workforces won’t be disrupted.</p>



<p>Activists and health care workers <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/COVID-19-Telangana-Govt-Grossly-Under-Reporting-Cases-Activists">have warned</a> that the state of Telangana “vastly” underreported cases of Covid-19 and deaths related to the virus.

Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself.

Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write. If she was paying thousands of pounds every week, it heightened her awareness time passing. She was paying for every minute, so she'd better produce something worth it.</p><p>Now, this grand gesture is not available to all of us, but another is:&nbsp;<strong>a trip.</strong></p><p>To help himself decide whether to start his online training program AltMBA, Seth Godin went into the desert for a few days with his friends.</p><p>He had one objective for himself: decide.</p><p>He thought about the project, wrote about it, and ultimately decided to commit and do it.</p><p>Could you take a trip somewhere as an opportunity to make a decision you’ve been putting off?</p><p>If you don't want to make yourself work using the above, the other choice is creating a routine in your life to take on non-urgent work without pressure.</p><h2>2. Choosing to work now</h2><h3>Make time for Q2 or it won't happen</h3><p>The anti-dote to reactive site and app checking is&nbsp;<strong>consciously blocking out big uninterrupted chunks of time.</strong></p><p>Our mind works best when we focus on 1 task for an extended period of time, without interruptions.</p><p>If you have email or social media open at all times, you'll get interrupted.</p><h3>Decide to set specific times aside</h3><p>When was the last time you had 2+ hours to work on non-urgent tasks? A time when you didn’t check any distractions and had no one interrupt you?</p><p>If you have to starch your memory extensively to find an answer, then it may be time for a change.</p><p>Uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity, particularly when it comes to dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.</p><p>It’s also crucial to specify what you’re going to work on. Without a clear intention, the urgent work and unproductive habits will take over.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is to put a big block on the calendar and put what you need to do as the title. You can also add any links or notes to the description.</p><p>When in your week can you do this? When can you make time for futures oriented, important work?</p><h3>Choose to work because you can</h3><p>The last point may well be the most important one. Much of our time, we don’t choose to work. We’re forced to do so by our circumstances. That puts us in a defensive position.</p><p>But we can actively&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to do work. Choose to write that email. Choose to reach out to someone. Choose to start working on the next project. Go on offense.</p><p>Fear is the default motivator for many of us. If I don't do this, I will [insert unpleasant consequences here].</p><p>There are other ways, other internal narratives that we can use.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I have the time and I'm alert and able.""I'll do this because the sooner I do it, the better.""I'll get this done now because it would be awesome if it existed."</p><p>Instead of focusing on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;do something, focus on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>do</em>.</p><p>Switch from the fear of consequences to desire for a specific awesome version of the future.</p><p><strong>When you do block out a 2 hour block of time and find yourself with nothing urgent to do, choose to work.</strong>&nbsp;Because you can. Because you want to create something awesome. Because it will make you happy at the end of the day, week, month, and year.</p><p>Don't wait until circumstances force you, go on offense now!</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>There are 2 main ways to get non-urgent work done:</p><ol start=""><li>Make it feel urgent.</li><li>Choose to do it.</li></ol><p>To make work feel more urgent, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Create consequences for your inaction.</p><ul><li>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</li><li>Promise publicly you'll do something.</li><li>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</li><li>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Make yourself hyper-aware of not taking action.</p><ul><li>Work alongside others with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></li><li>Make not taking action feel wasteful to yourself (scrolling social media in a 5 star hotel).</li></ul></li></ul><p>To choose to do non-urgent work:</p><ul><li>Block out big uninterrupted chunks of time for non-urgent work.</li><li>Assign specific times to specific tasks.</li><li>When you have the opportunity, choose to work because you can.</li></ul><p>Pick 1 strategy out of this article and apply it today!</p></article></div>]]>

 <p>In the past (and occasionally in the present in some companies), we used to do lots of manual grunt work setting up our infrastructure. A typical approach to launching an infrastructure involved raising tickets to your data center provider and waiting for them to execute your request. A system administrator grabs the ticket and generally uses a management portal of some sort, and starts clicking away at different configuration menus until your infrastructure is deployed and provisioned.</p>

<p>This approach has worked fine for many data centers that didn’t frequently change for a long time. These companies would have virtual machines that stayed up for months or even years that didn’t scale as often.</p>

<p>Since then, infrastructure has transitioned into the cloud with companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, and many others, giving us a complete infrastructure as a service platform. Instead of having someone else provision the infrastructure for us, we have all the necessary tools required to deploy our infrastructure in the cloud. Despite having the tools provided by these companies, we still have to rely on manual infrastructure provisioning, which creates room for mistakes and more things to forget.</p>

It allows you to define your data center’s desired state and overall topology in a definition file, then uses your definition files to feed into software to provision and deploy your infrastructure, giving you very consistent and predictable environments. The benefits of infrastructure as code are many, and there is very little reason not to use it. Here are just a few of the ways Iac can help you.</span></p>

<p>Iac will ensure consistency and make your environments the same every time you deploy a new environment. It also protects you from forgetting things, such as setting up a Security Group or DNS configuration, which is a drawback of manual human work.</p>

<p>Since everything is in a definition file for each infrastructure piece, Iac gives you a repeatable process with reusable components. Repeatable in the sense that you can now deploy that exact infrastructure on different platforms and environments. Reusability gives you the ability to deploy and reuse the same definition files across multiple project infrastructures. For example, if you have a web server with a specific configuration, you can use that configuration combined with other infrastructure pieces to make your task much more straightforward.</p>

<p>Finally, Since your infrastructure is code, you can commit the changes to source control software like Git, giving you the ability to track and version the change history and the evolution of your infrastructure over time. Source control also allows multiple team members to work together on the same infrastructure in a distributed way, and it keeps track of who changed what to the infrastructure.</p>

<p>Now that we understand what Iac is and why it’s important let’s talk about the two types of Iac configurations. As we’ve mentioned before, Iac uses configuration languages like YAML, JSON, HCL, and others. There are two main types of Iac configuration styles. Declarative and Imperative.</p>

<p>Imperative style is a way of writing configurations for an Iac software using a detailed and procedural set of instructions to provision your infrastructure. It needs to know the steps and the order in which it should create the infrastructure. That’s probably a bit hard to understand, so let me explain it with a pizza example.</p>

<p>Software that uses declarative configuration comes preconfigured to perform routine tasks. All you have to do is declare your desired state, and the software will take care of the rest. You don’t have to give it step by step instructions on what it should do since the software already understands how to perform your task and in which order.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terraform is an open-source declarative style infrastructure as code software created by HashiCorp. It uses a declarative style syntax known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform uses a push-based model to make changes to your infrastructure, which means that Terraform does not require you to install an agent software running on the infrastructure to use it. All you need is the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform CLI tool installed</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on your machine, with the credentials or token of your cloud provider, and you’re good to go. Terraform is not limited to cloud providers only and can also provision on-premises infrastructures like OpenStack and VMware. It can work with Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda functions. Finally, Terraform works equally well with Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms like DataDog, CDNs such as Fastly, and even Github.</span></p>

<p>Terraform is idempotent, meaning when you run a command using Terraform to deploy a piece of infrastructure, it remembers the state. If you try to run the same configuration, it will not make any changes keeping everything in-tact and preventing accidental modifications of your infrastructure. If we reuse our pizza example, suppose you asked for Terraform to make you a pizza, and it does, then you ask it again, it will tell you, “I already gave you a pizza” unless you specify you want a new pizza Terraform won’t make it.</p>

<p>These are the configuration files that you will create and feed to Terraform. When you make an infrastructure setup, you typically have one or more terraform files inside a directory, which terraform uses to combine and create an infrastructure for you based on those files’ contents.</p>

<p>Finally, once Terraform has provisioned your resources, it creates a state file that contains your current infrastructure’s state. Terraform can then keep track of the changes that happen over time. For example, if you have updates to your infrastructure Terraform will compare those changes and apply only the essential differences between your new changes and your current infrastructure state.</p>

<p>Terraform has two fundamental pieces that make it work, the core and providers. The core is the part of Terraform that understands your configuration and manages your infrastructure’s state definition files. It handles all lifecycle related management, such as planning creating, updating, as well as destroying your infrastructure. The second part is the providers. Providers are how Terraform connects to the outside world, such as AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and Azure.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="67c077d4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>The vision behind Activechat is to make the most advanced AI technology easily available for customer care applications even if your team has zero technical background. This vision empowers our <a href="https://docs.activechat.ai/docs/natural-language-chatbots/">natural-language integrations</a>, <a href="https://activechat.ai/conversational-ai/">sentiment detection</a>, and other advanced features packed into our <a href="https://activechat.ai/chatbots/">visual chatbot builder</a>. But there’s more to it, and we’re happy to introduce our recent integration with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenAI's (opens in a new tab)" href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI’s</a> beta of their GPT-3 model – GPT-3 for live chat.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-3 is a mega machine learning model, created by&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, and it can write it’s own op-eds, poems, articles, and even working code. As a result of its humongous size (over 175 billion parameters), GPT-3 can do what no other model can do (well): perform&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;tasks without any special tuning. You can ask GPT-3 to be a translator, a programmer, a poet, or a famous author, and it can do it with its user (you) providing fewer than 10 training examples.&nbsp;<em>Damn</em>.</p><cite><a href="https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dale Markowitz (opens in a new tab)">Dale Markowitz</a></cite></blockquote><p>Activechat has partnered with OpenAI team to build something that looks like real magic. Once you describe the context of your business in a plain natural language and provide a couple of example questions and answers that your human live chat agents may encounter in their day-to-day conversations with customers, we can use the power of GPT-3 to provide instant hints to your agents to help them answer almost any question that a customer may have.</p><p>Let’s look at some real-life examples of this amazing tech.</p><h2>Bike shop – default settings</h2><p>Imagine that you’re the owner of a bike shop selling hundreds of bikes from various manufacturers. Your website has a lot of traffic and you introduce <a href="https://activechat.ai/live-chat/">live chat</a> to help your customers make their choice and grow your revenue. After a week of accepting incoming chat requests, you suddenly realize that training your agents so that they can really answer this crazy amount of questions from customers-to-be takes tons of time and is quite costly. You have your knowledge base, but most of your agents feel lost when it comes to answering specific questions, and looking for the correct answer often takes quite a lot of time.</p><p>Luckily enough, your live chat solution is powered by Activechat, so you can go to “Settings – Integrations – OpenAI” and describe your business case in plain natural language:</p><blockquote><p>This is a conversation between a website visitor and a smart virtual assistant. The conversations are happening across various pages of the website that is selling bicycles, and virtual assistant can answer all kinds of questions about various bike brands and models and help choose the right one according to description made by the visitor.</p><cite>That’s all you need to seed the OpenAI’s GPT-3 for live chat</cite></blockquote><p>Next, you provide answers to three questions that your customers ask most often:</p><p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong><em> What’s the difference between a carbon and regular bike?<br></em><strong><em>A:</em></strong><em> The primary difference between carbon and aluminum comes down to weight and ride quality. Carbon frames are usually a bit lighter than aluminum — up to a pound for mountain frames and up to a half-pound on road frames.</em></p><p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong><em> How much does a good bike cost?<br></em><strong><em>A:</em></strong><em> Road bikes range between $350 and $700, Mountain bikes around $1000, Single-speed bike – $400, Beach cruiser $200-300, Recumbent bike $1000-2000, and Kids’ bike (3-8 yrs) will be $140-200.</em></p><p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong><em> How do I service my bike?<br></em><strong><em>A:</em></strong><em> You should regularly service your bike to ensure it is running efficiently and that there are no worn or damaged components. The more you ride the bike the more frequent you should be servicing it, especially after riding in dirt, sand, mud and in the rain.</em></p><p>Guess what? Your training is complete!</p><p>Now your agents can pull the “Show AI hints” tab in their live chat interface, and on every new message from a website visitor, there will be 2-3 ready-made answers suggested by the GPT-3 engine.</p><div><figure><img src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440.png" data-src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440.png 860w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440-300x123.png 300w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440-768x316.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440.png 860w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440-300x123.png 300w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598458150440-768x316.png 768w"><figcaption>GPT-3 for live chat provides instant answer suggestions</figcaption></figure></div><p>Clicking any of these hints will copy the answer to the message window, and your agents can send it immediately or edit it, adding specific links to your product pages or other resources. Based on our research, this can reduce the time needed to find and type the answer by 70-80%!</p><p>If you’re not satisfied with what you see, just hit the “Refresh” icon and a new set of hints will appear. These hints are powered by all knowledge that the Internet has (GPT-3 model is trained on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Common Crawl (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl" target="_blank">Common Crawl</a> data, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, and multiple other data sources, including a huge amount of books). This makes suggested answers sound human-like and in most cases, they will be relevant, useful, and valuable to your customers.</p><h2>AI-powered live chat for mobile phones outlet</h2><p>Another use case from one of our customers – an online shop selling mobile phones. Again, the problem is quite similar to the bike shop above – customers repeatedly ask questions that require a solid chunk of knowledge from customer service agents. Novice agents keep forwarding these questions to more experienced team members, and instead of taking care of really complex queries, these team members keep wasting their time responding to the same questions again and again.</p><p>After they introduced GPT-3 for live chat, their seeding settings would look like this:</p><div><figure><a href="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-1024x651.png" data-src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-1024x651.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-1024x651.png 1024w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-300x191.png 300w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-768x489.png 768w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936.png 1200w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-1024x651.png 1024w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-300x191.png 300w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936-768x489.png 768w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460388936.png 1200w"></a><figcaption>GPT-3 settings for mobile phones retailer</figcaption></figure></div><p> And here is an example conversation that was made completely by sending GPT-3 answer suggestions, with zero time required from the human agent:</p><div><figure><a href="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749.png" data-src="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749.png 806w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749-255x300.png 255w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749-768x905.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" srcset="https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749.png 806w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749-255x300.png 255w, https://mk0activechat51ch1bq.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598460362749-768x905.png 768w"></a><figcaption>GPT-3-powered live chat conversation</figcaption></figure></div><h2>How to use GPT-3 for live chat?</h2><p>Currently, OpenAI’s GPT-3 is in a public beta.

Balancing games is difficult, but difficult problems are fun. In this post, I’ll dig into some of the maths behind <a href="https://www.glasstomegames.co.uk/home/the-long-road">The Long Road</a>.</p>

<p>The Long Road (TLR) blends elements of roguelike games and classic text-adventure. You play as a group of scavengers wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland; collecting food, weapons, and more scavengers in a bid to survive. As you explore your world, you are presented with choices that shape the world around you and ultimately determine how long you will last. But, how long <em>should</em> that be?</p>







<p>There is tension in TLR. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uE6-vIi1rQ">A cursed problem</a> arising due to conflicting promises that we make players. We want players to make meaningful decisions, think strategically, and try to survive as long as possible. However, enabling the player to survive forever through skill alone renders the game boring. One popular way to solve this problem, is by injecting some randomness. Now players are a dice-roll away from thriving (or failing).</p>

<p>But how do we maintain this knife-edge? Give the player too much and their dice rolls become meaningless. Be too harsh and every run feels horribly unfair. To better understand how to successfully design TLR, we will need to dig into the numbers.</p>



<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/3/LongRoadJumpHD.gif"></p>

<p>There are three resources in The Long Road: food, weapons, and scavengers. Scavengers eat your food to survive: more scavengers need more food and without it, they die. Weapons enable combat options in conflicts — outcomes are better with them than without… The game ends only when you run out of scavengers.</p>

<p>TLR is turn-based, allowing the player to choose one of four directions to move in during each turn. Each new tile you explore may give you either some resources, a conflict, or nothing at all. At the end of the turn, your scavengers consume some of your food (or starve and die). The Long Road includes a healthy serving of randomness, but we want to know how long the player should <em>expect</em> a game to last. Let’s start with some simple first steps.</p>

<h2 id="wanderers-not-yet-scavengers">Wanderers, not yet scavengers</h2>

<p>For now, forget about the randomness and look at a simplified problem. If scavengers found no resources, how long would they last on the long road?</p>

<p>Let \(X_t\) be our food at the start of turn \(t\), and \(Y_t\) be our scavenger count. Each scavenger consumes \(\alpha &gt; 0\) food per turn. Remember, the game runs out when the last scavenger dies (\(Y_t &lt; 1\)). In this simplified version of TLR, the food changes each turn using the following rule,</p>

\[X_{t+1} = \max(X_{t} - \alpha Y_{t}, 0).\]

<p>Additionally, each excess unit of food that is consumed leads to a scavenger’s death:</p>

\[Y_{t+1} = Y_{t} + \min(0, X_{t} - \alpha Y_{t}).\]

<p>This is already looking pretty complicated, but we can make better sense of this by picking some specific values. If we take \(\alpha = 0.5\) for example, then in each turn we consume food equal to half of our scavengers. And if we have zero food left, then half of our scavengers die each turn.</p>

<p>The quantity we care about here is how many turns we can last before we hit game over, i.e., the smallest \(t\) with \(Y_{t} &lt; 1\). First, how many turns before we run out of food? This is given by \(X_{0} / (\alpha Y_{0})\). After this point, the scavenger count evolves like,</p>

\[Y_{t} = (1 - \alpha) Y_{t-1} = (1 - \alpha)^{t} Y_0.\]

<p>Now notice that if \(\alpha \geq 1\), then it takes only one turn for all of the scavengers to starve to death once the food has run out. If the scavengers ration better (\(\alpha &lt; 1\)), then we need,</p>

\[t &gt; \frac{- \log(Y_0)}{\log (1 - \alpha)},\]

<p>turns for all of the scavengers to starve (\(Y_t &lt; 1\)). So the total number of turns is roughly,</p>

\[\frac{X_{0}}{\alpha Y_0} + \frac{- \log(Y_0)}{\log (1 - \alpha)}.\]

<details>
<summary>Why <i>roughly</i>?</summary>
Remember that the food and scavenger counts are integers but we're ignoring rounding effects here for simplicity.
</details>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/wanderer_sim.gif"></p>

<p>Looking at this quantity, we see that adding more scavengers decreases the total number of turns. While adding more food increases it. On the other hand, as scavengers get more greedy (\(\alpha\) increases) then they last fewer turns.</p>

<p>The animation on the left simulates our boring survival game. Food decreases at a fixed rate until it runs out and the scavenger dies. The red vertical line indicates our predicted stopping point (the first time when the scavenger count is &lt;1).</p>

<h2 id="scavengers">Scavengers</h2>

<p>Let’s make things slightly more interesting. Now our scavengers have learned that to survive they need to find more food, and friends. In each turn, scavengers find \(C &gt; 0\) more food, and \(K &gt; 0\) new scavengers join the group. The group then consumes the food at rate \(\alpha &lt; 1\) per scavenger. Our new food dynamics are given by,</p>

\[X_{t+1} = \max(X_{t} - \alpha (Y_{t} + K) + C, 0).\]

<p>Each turn, scavengers consume food — including the \(K\) new friends we found — but we also gain \(C\) new food. Similarly, the scavenger dynamics become,</p>

\[Y_{t+1} = Y_{t} + K + \min(0, X_{t} - \alpha (Y_{t} + K) + C).\]

<p>We gain the \(K\) new scavengers, but we may also lose some scavengers to starvation. How many turns can the scavengers last now?</p>

<p>First, notice that if \(C &gt; \alpha (Y_t + K)\) then the scavengers gain food on each turn. But the number of scavengers is always increasing by \(K\). The scavengers will stabilize when \(X_{t} - \alpha (Y_t + K) + C = -K\). When this condition holds, we also have \(X_t = 0\). Solving these together, we get the equilibrium point,</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/scavenger_sim.gif"></p>

\[X^* = 0,\:\:\: Y^* = \frac{C + K}{\alpha} - K.\]

<p>On the right, we see a simulation of these dynamics. The red horizontal line indicates the stable point for the scavengers, which is reached before 10 steps.</p>

<p>So long as \(\alpha &lt; (C + K) / K\) (this is always true when \(\alpha &lt; 1\)), each turn some scavengers die and are replaced anew. But sadism aside, this isn’t very exciting for the player — they can never lose! How can we fix this?</p>

<h2 id="scavengers-scavenge-sometimes">Scavengers scavenge, sometimes</h2>

<p>Instead of giving a constant amount of food and scavengers to the player, let’s make each of them random. With probability \(p &lt; 1\) the player gains \(C\) food, with probability \(q &lt; 1 - p\) the player gains \(K\) scavengers, and otherwise nothing.</p>

<p>Our dynamics are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic">stochastic</a>, meaning sometimes things go up and sometimes they go down. They also form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>; the present state tells us everything that we need to know about predicting the future.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/stoch_scavenger_sim.gif"><br>
This leads to much more interesting dynamics.</p>

<p>The stochastic dynamics are significantly more complicated than the deterministic cases before. We now care about a random variable: the stopping time of the process (when the number of scavengers goes below 1). We need to reason about this random variable in terms of its distribution or moments, e.g. the expected value. <strong>I’d love to say more about this, but I haven’t figured it out yet… Let me know if you have any ideas or a reference that might help!</strong></p>

<p>Regardless, being able to simulate these systems lets us estimate the stopping time and figure out how tweaking parameters under the hood of our game will affect the average run time and variance within. This is powerful when it comes to balancing — we can instantly simulate a simplified run of the game and get an idea of how long things should last.</p>



<p>In this post, we explored only a simplified version of the game. However, the dynamics that we explored are close to the ones we utilize in TLR. [There are a few differences and maybe I’ll explore these in a future post…] On the other hand, we completely ignored several important components that make up our game.</p>

<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>

<p>Instead of gaining a random amount of resources, players might find themselves faced with a conflict in which they must decide what to do. The outcome from their choice is random, and can range from wonderful to catastrophic. Weapons become useful during conflicts, where they unlock additional choices that are more likely to have favourable outcomes.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/TLR_Cultist_Conflict.png"></p>

<p>Conflicts are an additional layer of complexity in TLR’s dynamics, and also provide the player with greater agency — something that good balance should take into account. We want the player to feel that they are making meaningful decisions that impact their fate while maintaining that knife-edge balance.</p>

<h2 id="biomes">Biomes</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/biomes.png"></p>

<p>In addition to our three resources, TLR has three different biomes to explore. Each has its own set of rules governing how the player’s resources change. Forests provide the player with more food but fewer weapons. The wastelands provide very few resources but are generally low-risk. And the cities provide plentiful resources, but have a high chance of dangerous conflicts.</p>

<p>Balancing around the biomes is also tricky. We want to encourage the player to move strategically between biomes. One way in which we do this is by restricting conflicts to occur only in specific biomes, meaning the player will need to explore to uncover more of the story. Additionally, explored tiles don’t give any new resources/conflicts so that the player must keep moving. We are thinking hard about how the different dynamics in each biome can be combined to give well-balanced, meaningful gameplay.</p>



<p>This post only scratches the surface on balancing TLR. We showed, quantitatively, that randomness is needed to make the game interesting. Without it, the survival dynamics become predictable and unexciting. However, we will need to revisit these ideas and build out more complex models to make meaningful balance decisions.</p>

    <p>A retail investor would be forgiven for assuming that there are really
only two assets classes one should consider for personal investments:
equities (stocks) and fixed income (bonds). Wherever you look, these two
asset classes dominate the financial landscape. All robo-advisors and
most personal advisors implement a mix of bonds and equities for the
portfolios of their clients. The idea behind this mix is simple: bonds
are low risk and will earn you a marginal return, while equities are
riskier and will be the real engine of returns in good times. In bad
times, bonds will rise, mitigating some of the losses of your equity
portfolio: it's been long known and accepted that stocks and bonds have
a negative correlation. Tying this strategy together is periodic
rebalancing, taking money off the table during bull markets (and moving
them to the safer bonds), and deploying money to the equity portion
during bear markets. This in effect overlays a mean-reversion strategy
onto the portfolio, boosting the returns of an otherwise static
portfolio. The archetypal allocation is 60% equities, and 40% bonds,
though each investor's allocation is going to differ based on his risk
tolerance, age, and personal goals.</p>

<p>Though there's nothing wrong with this two asset class mix, the
historically negative correlation between stocks and bonds means that in
most market environments, bonds are going to drag down the portfolio.
Ideally, we would want to mix in uncorrelated assets and investments
instead of negatively correlated ones, in order to reduce the volatility
of our portfolio without dragging down our returns. Alternative
investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, metals, or real estate
all serve this purpose. These alternative investments are not only
popular for their occasionally spectacular returns, but also for their
low correlation to the broader equity market. For this post, we'll use
the oldest and possibly most maligned investment, gold, and explore ways
to mix it into a pure equity, S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</p>

<h2 id="gold">Gold</h2>

<p>Gold and other metals are an interesting and, unfortunately,
underappreciated asset class. The much derided "gold-bug" is made out
to be paranoid, crazy, and irrational. Despite being so rare and
valuable, the percentage of the world's gold supply that is used for
industrial uses is comparatively small, creating a phenomenon that
untethers the price of gold from other asset classes. Let's look at the
returns of gold versus the S&amp;P 500 between 2010-01-01 and 2020-07-08:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/gold.png" alt="S&amp;P 500 vs Gold"></p>

<p>It's evident that the returns of gold are unspectacular, to say the
least. It doesn't seem to consistently lose or gain value as much as it
meanders around, seemingly uncorrelated to the S&amp;P 500. And indeed, it
is almost entirely uncorrelated, with a correlation to the S&amp;P 500 of
only 1% over this time period. Is it even worth including in our
portfolio? And if it is, how would we determine the allocation size?</p>

<h2 id="monte-carlo">Monte-Carlo</h2>

<p>To clarify, we're trying to determine the weights for the S&amp;P 500 and
gold parts of our portfolio, taking on no leverage:</p><p>

\[|x_a| + |x_b| = 1\]

</p><p>And maximizing the risk-adjusted return. For every unit of risk we take,
we would like to maximize the amount of return we receive. We'll first
start off by doing the most straightforward thing, and randomly choosing
different weights for our two asset portfolio and then graphing them:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/ef.png" alt="Return vs Volatility"></p>

<p>This hyperbola formed is called the <em>Markowitz Bullet</em>, after Harry
Markowitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on
<em>Modern Portfolio Theory</em>. The portfolio with the best return vs
volatility profile is called the <em>frontier</em> or <em>efficient</em> portfolio.
There exists only one such portfolio and it is the portfolio every
rational investor should prefer, ignoring borrowings costs and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax">volatility drag</a> (for
more information about volatility drag, check out my other post
<a href="https://cryptm.org/posts/2019/11/28/div.html">here</a>, or the beginning
of my three part series
<a href="https://cryptm.org/posts/2019/10/04/vol.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>While it's relatively easy to find what would have been the frontier
portfolio looking backwards, it is much more difficult to estimate the
frontier portfolio over some future time period. We can forecast and
then reduce future volatility with modest accuracy, but forecasting
expected return is a notoriously difficult problem. So difficult, in
fact, that few quantitative investors even try, instead resigning
themselves to solely minimize volatility. Likewise, we'll resign
ourselves to the same fate.</p>

<p>In the general case of a many asset portfolio, no closed form solution
can be found for the minimization of volatility, we must instead use an
optimizer or do a Monte-Carlo simulation; but in the two asset case, we
can find a symbolic solution. So that's what we'll do next!</p>

<h2 id="symbolic-solution">Symbolic Solution</h2>

<p>Recall that our portfolio return is going to be a function of our two
assets and their weights:</p><p>

\[P = x_a X_a+ x_b X_b\]

</p><p>Likewise, our expected portfolio mean would look like:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   E[P] &amp;= \mu_P\\
   &amp;= x_a E[X_a] + x_b E[X_b]\\
   &amp;= x_a \mu_a + x_b \mu_b\\
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>And the equation for variance:</p><p>

\[\text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 = E[(X-\mu)^2]\]

</p><p>Covariance is similar, except instead of squaring, we multiply each
variable after demeaning:</p><p>

\[\text{Cov}[X,Y] = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]\]

</p><p>Now we just need to derive the portfolio variance:</p><p>

\[\text{Var}[P] = \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b]\]

</p><p>First we substitute for variance and rearrange:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; E[(x_aX_a + x_b X_b - E[x_a X_a + x_b X_b])^2]\\
   =&amp; E[(x_a X_a - E[x_a X_a] + x_b X_b - E[x_b X_b])^2]
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Now we can pull the constants out of the expectations, substitute, and
expand:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_a X_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; E[(x_a (X_a - \mu_a) + x_b (X_b - \mu_b))^2] \\
   =&amp; E[x_a^2(X_a - \mu_a)^2 + x_b^2(X_b - \mu_b)^2 + 2 x_a x_b (X_a - \mu_a)(X_b - \mu_b)]
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Finally, we break up the expectations, and replace:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_a X_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; x^2_a E[(X_a - \mu_a)^2] + x^2_b E[X_b - \mu_b] + 2x_a x_b E[(X_a-\mu_a)(X_b-\mu_b)]\\
   =&amp; x^2_a \sigma_a^2 + x^2_b \sigma_b^2 + 2 x_a x_b \text{Cov}[X_a,X_b]\\
   =&amp; x^2_a \sigma_a^2 + x^2_b \sigma_b^2 + 2 x_a x_b \rho_{ab} \sigma_a \sigma_b
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Where $\rho_{ab}$ is the correlation between $X_a$ and $X_b$:</p><p>

\[\rho_{ab} = \frac{\text{Cov}[X_a,X_b]}{\sigma_a\sigma_b}\]

</p><p>Now that we have an equation for variance in terms of the weights, mean,
volatility, and correlation between the two assets, we can formulate our
objective:</p><p>

\[\min\left( \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b]\right)\]

</p><p>Where:</p><p>

\[x_a + x_b = 1\]

</p><p>We perform the substitution $x_b = 1 - x_a$ and then take the derivative
with respect to $x_a$:</p><p>

\[\frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma_P}{\mathrm{d}x_a}=2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - 2 \, \sigma_{b}^{2} - 2 \, {\left(2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{a}^{2} - \sigma_{b}^{2}\right)} x_{a}\]

</p><p>Now we set to 0 and solve for $x_a$:</p><p>

\[x_{a} = \frac{\rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{b}^{2}}{2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{a}^{2} - \sigma_{b}^{2}}\]

</p><p>And $x_b$:</p><p>

\[x_b = 1 - x_a\]

</p><p>Note that sometimes this equation will give us values for $x_a$ and
$x_b$ that imply leverage, i.e:</p><p>

\[|x_a| + |x_b| &gt; 1\]

</p><p>But we can always rescale them by dividing each one by $|x_a| + |x_b|$.
In the next section, we'll put this formula to work.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-weights">Portfolio Weights</h2>

<p>We're going to use a one year or 252 day rolling window to generate the
weights. Everyday, we slide our window over one and generate the new
weights for that day. Below is the generated graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/gw.png" alt="S&amp;P 500 Weight vs Gold weight"></p>

<p>Well that's interesting, the weights change considerably over time. In
a real portfolio, not only would we be using an optimizer and a
multitude of risk factors to determine the weights, but we would also
have constraints on position size, turnover, and the magnitude of
deviation from the "ideal" portfolio, and etc. But even in this simple
and contrived example, we see that our formula is doing its job: as the
volatility of the S&amp;P 500 increases, like at the end of 2018 and during
Coronavirus, we start cutting back our equity exposure.</p>

<p>Let's now look at the returns of our portfolio compared to both gold
and the S&amp;P 500:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/altr.png" alt="Portfolio vs S&amp;P 500 vs Gold"></p>

<p>A lot of gains from the market are given up, as we might have expected,
but the return stream becomes a lot less volatile. Just looking at a
graph of cumulative returns isn't super informative, so here's a table
of various metrics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Gold</th>
      <th>S&amp;P 500</th>
      <th>Portfolio</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Vol</td>
      <td>15.8%</td>
      <td>17.4%</td>
      <td>10.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Ret</td>
      <td>4.3%</td>
      <td>12.4%</td>
      <td>8.4%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta</td>
      <td>0.01</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0.41</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Sharpe</td>
      <td>0.27</td>
      <td>0.71</td>
      <td>0.77</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Wow! Our volatility is lower than either gold or the S&amp;P 500 alone, our
beta has been cut more than in half compared to the S&amp;P 500, and our
Sharpe ratio is even higher than both! Even with mixing in an asset that
had poor returns and high volatility, we've managed to construct a
portfolio that, on a risk-adjusted basis, is superior to the S&amp;P 500.
And, if we so desired, could be levered up in order to beat the return
of the S&amp;P 500, while maintaining comparatively low volatility.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even with a bad Sharpe ratio and less than stellar returns, gold
enhanced our pure equity portfolio. The same also can be said about
other, more popular, alternative investments. Hedge funds specifically
are often derided for their low returns and frequent meltdowns (such as
Long-Term Capital Management); but like with gold, looks can be
deceiving. Returns and volatility aren't the whole story. When
designing a portfolio, each individual investment is irrelevant, and
instead the return stream of the portfolio as a whole is what matters.
Considered in isolation, a lot of alternative investments look
sub-optimal and irrational. It is only when you zoom out and think about
the needs of the investor (their existing allocations, investment goals,
monetary needs, etc) does everything come into perspective. When it
comes to investing, the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its
parts!</p>

<p><span>iOS devices became widely used in an enterprise level daily-work now a days, due to this we&nbsp;need to have guaranteed secure communications between device and associated enterprise services.</span></p>
<p>So question raise about enterprise environment security which can be covered with the help of&nbsp;<strong>VPN</strong>&nbsp;or any other third party tool. Actually what VPN does is creating&nbsp;<strong>secure tunnel</strong>&nbsp;between&nbsp;<strong>identity</strong>&nbsp;device and service which is hosted on&nbsp;cloud or on partner networks.</p>
<p>Thats one part of accessing enterprise service but what if we don’t want to use any VPN client and still wants to access enterprise service from any device in our case we are taking&nbsp;<strong>iOS device</strong>.<span>One way of doing that is using&nbsp;<strong>digital certificates</strong>&nbsp;to encrypt/decrypt, sign and authenticate communications and data.So how we can use certificate on iOS device at&nbsp;<strong>system leve</strong>l so that iOS can use that certificate while consuming services.&nbsp;<strong>Advantage</strong>&nbsp;of this over VPN is,&nbsp;User has login every time on VPN Client to consume services where as deploying certificate on iOS device is one time activity and it will work all along till User removed certificate.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amitdhadse.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/ssl-certificate.png?w=224&amp;h=186" alt="ssl-certificate" width="224" height="186"></p>
<p><span>I have been asked to create an iOS app to request and deploy digital certificates in device system keychain so that, it will be recognised by all system apps of iOS while accessing enterprise services. After doing my research I concluded that in iOS devices there are two types of certificate keychain stores:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>App certificates keychain store:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><span>This keychain store embedded<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in app space and can be used by that app only.(Not exposed at system level)</span></li>
<li>Apple offer APIs to Insert/Delete/Update certificate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>System certificate keychain store:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This keychain is exposed at system level. This store located in Setting -&gt; General -&gt; Profiles used for VPN and wifi networks</li>
<li>Apple does not offer any API to&nbsp;<span>deploy/retrieve certificates from the system certificate keychain store (Profiles)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>So there are four ways to deploy certificates to system certificate keychain store (not programmatically):</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong><em>Configuration Profiles</em></strong>: Pre-configured profiles that used to distribute settings.(These can be created on MAC and deploy in iOS device)</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Using Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP)</em>:</strong>&nbsp;this protocol enables Over-the-Air Enrolment of digital certificates, mainly used for routers and switches.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Email Attachment</em>:</strong>&nbsp;send the certificate from a desktop or mac to iOS device as an email attachment. Open this attachment(certificate) in iOS mail client ( having system privileges ). It will automatically ask you for installation.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Using Safari</em>:</strong>&nbsp;browse the certificate using Safari. Safari has system privileges over normal UIWebView.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After I did my research I found a workaround that worked for me to deploy a certificate to the System Certificate Store from Xcode directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you will need to do, first, to create a web-server inside your App, then save the certificate in this web-server and open it’s URL.</span></p>
<p><span>When the page launches, Safari will recognize that it’s a certificate, then the System Profiles will pop up and ask the user to install the certificate. After the user install the certificate it will be saved to the Profiles and the certificate can be used in the System level.</span></p>
<p><span>To create web server inside iOS app, there are 2-3 libraries are available on Git. I recommend “<strong>GCDWebserver</strong>” library to create web server due to its easy implementation, background support and most important it is stable.</span></p>
<p><span>How to use&nbsp;<strong>GCDWebserver</strong>&nbsp;:-</span></p>
<pre><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><b>let</b></span> localServer = <span>GCDWebDAVServer</span>(uploadDirectory: path)
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>localServer?.start(withPort: <span>8080</span>, bonjourName: <span><b>nil</b></span>)
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><b>let</b></span> url = localServer?.serverURL
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>UIApplication.shared.open(url)</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Here “path” is your certificate path(in my case it was document directory path as my certificate was store in document directory(NSDocumentDirectory) folder).</li>
<li>“serverURL”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>will return URL of certificate which is hosted on local server.</li>
<li>Open this URL on safari, Safari recognise that it is certificate and pops an installation alert automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note :-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now in this scenario here is one problem, as soon as user open URL in safari, user were no longer in app all control is shift to safari and to comeback in app, user has to do manually.</em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Solution :- import “</span><strong><span>SafariServices</span></strong><span>”&nbsp;</span>framework which already have a safari view in it which opens safari inside your app.</p>
<p><span>I spent a lot of time and research efforts to reach upto this solution, I hope someone surly will get benefit from my results. Please contact me for any question.</span></p>

<p>One of the most underappreciated features introduced since Go version 1.8 is the Go plugin package. Plugins are one of the many software architectural designs that allow you to build loosely coupled and modular programs. In Go, plugins are written and compiled separately as shared objects (.so) or libraries and can be loaded dynamically during runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incorporating extensibility into your programs is always considered a good practice, and there are many approaches to this. However, the current plugin package in Go does come with its fair share of headaches. Below is a side-by-side table listing the Go plugins’ pros and cons in its current state.</p>

<p>The basic shipping calculator will give you rates based on which shipping method and parcel weight you provide. You can support different shipping methods by adding new plugins, and the calculator will produce the rates and currency based on your preferred shipping method. The interface for a shipping method contains three functions, GetCurrency,&nbsp; CalculateRate, and Name.</p>

<p>Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to extract information from it or enhance it. Digital image processing has a broad range of applications such as image restoration, medical imaging, remote sensing, image segmentation, etc. Every process requires a different technique.</p>



<p>In this article, we will be covering the <strong>top 6 image processing techniques</strong> for machine learning.</p>



<ol><li>Image Restoration</li><li>Linear Filtering</li><li>Independent Component Analysis</li><li>Pixelation</li><li>Template Matching</li><li>Image Generation Technique (GAN)</li></ol>

<p><em><a href="https://www.postproductie.cinemeta.nl/en/restoration-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>An image deteriorates for many reasons, for example, an old image of your grandparents which was taken with the old tech camera could become hazy or may lose its original form.</p>



<p>This could happen if the image goes under some physical stress or if it’s in digital form it could deteriorate by motion blur or additive noise.</p>



<p>So how are you going to restore it? Maybe it wasn’t possible 50 years back but now – it is.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~elec539/Projects99/BACH/proj2/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Researchers came up with a Degradation model</strong></a><strong> that can undo the deterioration effects on the input image. The degradation model works as a convolution with a linear shift-invariant.</strong></p>



<p>So we take an Image before the degradation which is called “True Image” and an Image after degradation which is called “Observed Image” with the degradation filter which <em>estimates</em> the “True Image”.</p>

<h3><strong>An example of image restoration using image inpainting with OpenCV</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Image impainting</a> also known as <strong>“Compensation of paint loss ”. </strong>This technique is often used to remove unwanted objects from an image to restore damaged parts of a deteriorated image.</p>



<pre><span>import</span> cv2
  
img = cv2.imread(<span>'damaged_image.png'</span>)
mask = cv2.imread(<span>'mask.png'</span>, <span>0</span>)
dst = cv2.inpaint(img, mask, <span>3</span>, cv2.INPAINT_NS)

cv2.imwrite(<span>'restored.png'</span>, dst)</pre>



<p>In the above code, we have two types of images</p>



<ol><li>Damaged</li><li>Masked</li></ol>



<p>A masked image has the same spatial dimensions of the noise which exists in the noisy image.</p>



<p>So if we input the image below with the above code:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27719" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/image-impainting-1" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-impainting-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=384%2C384&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 1" width="384" height="384" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With the mask:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27720" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/image-impainting-2" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-impainting-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 2" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Then we will get the following image:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>The biggest problem with OpenCV’s image inpainting is that we need to manually input a mask for the specific image we want to fix. So how can we automate this process?</p>



<p>The answer is <strong>GAN (General Adversarial Network)</strong>. This <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8686914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper</a> proposes that, by using a GAN network, image inpainting can be done using <strong>neighborhood loss function and gradient loss</strong> with a better quality restored image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Linear filtering is a process in which the value of the output pixel is linear combinations of the neighboring input pixels. This process is done by a technique called <strong>Convolution.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel.</strong></p>

<p>We have an input image and a kernel with an anchor point. In the above diagram, it’s H(1, 1).</p>



<p><strong>This filter works as a sliding window to convolve over the image.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We multiply each pixel by the corresponding kernel and then take the sum. That sum becomes a new pixel in the output image.</p>

<p>Independent Component Analysis or short for ICA is a <strong>technique for separating a multivariate signal into its underlying component. </strong>ICA helps in the extraction of the desired component from the mixture of multiple components or signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me explain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In ICA, we <em>“Whiten”</em> our signal. This means that a given will be transformed in a way that potential correlations between its component are removed and the variance of each component is equal to 1.&nbsp;</p>

s2 = np.sign(np.sin(<span>3</span> * time))  
s3 = signal.sawtooth(<span>2</span> * np.pi * time)  

S = np.c_[s1, s2, s3]
S += <span>0.2</span> * np.random.normal(size=S.shape)

<p>Template matching is a method for searching and finding the location of a <em>template </em>in a <em>larger</em> image. You can think of it as a very simple approach to object detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In template matching, we slide the <em>template </em>image over the <em>larger</em> image as we do in the convolution process and find the matching part</p>



<h3><strong>Template matching using OpenCV</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04302.pdf"><em>Source</em></a></p>



<p>With the help of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we can train a deep learning model on the image data to generate the same type of image data.</p>



<p>GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 which he described in the paper of <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Generative Adversarial Nets</a>.</p>



<p><strong>GANs are made of two distinct models&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>Generator</strong></li><li><strong>Discriminator</strong></li></ol>



<p>The job of the <strong>generator</strong> is to generate the <em>fake</em> images and <strong>discriminator</strong> try to classify between the <strong>fake image and real image</strong>. During the training, the <strong>generator</strong> tries to outsmart the discriminator by generating better fake images and the discriminator tries to improve itself for differentiating between the real image and a fake image. You can read more about <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/6-gan-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GAN architectures and training in this article.&nbsp;</a></p>





<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>So in this&nbsp; article, I briefly explained the most used image processing techniques in any machine learning project:</p>



<ul><li>Linear Filtering</li><li>Image Restoration</li><li>Template Matching</li><li>Image Generation Technique (GAN)</li><li>Pixelation</li><li>Independent Component Analysis</li></ul>



<p>But choosing the right technique requires experience and experience comes from practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So keep learning.</p>

<p>The prompt for this talk was to describe “what you learned building Zapier”. The most obvious thing I could share is tactical advice or early anecdotes. Things like how we got our first dozen customers to pay us before we really had a product or how we almost missed our acceptance call into <a href="https://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I'm still leaning <em>a ton</em> through today. Startups are very much “trial-by-fire” as a first-time founder.</p>

<p>But the more I thought about that talk prompt, I realized the biggest thing I learned actually began way, way earlier. It's a lesson that applies equally to launching Zapier as to endeavors which lie beyond.</p>



<p>Growing up I've was always into tech and I loved building things (I originally wanted to be an architect when I thought that's what they did).</p>

<p>I learned how to build websites after borrowing a friend's “Learn HTML in 24 Hours” book. My goal was to build an AOL Instant Messenger profile for myself, which conveniently, could render actual HTML.</p>

<p>Later I learned how to code “hardcore” by picking up assembly language. I did this so I could write TI-83+ calculator games and play them during class (much to the dismay to my teachers growing up).</p>

<p>Towards the end of high school though, it was time to pick a major. Computer Science was the obvious shoe-in. But I didn't want to do it! I feared that I would burn out and not have time/energy for side projects.</p>

<p>So I decided instead to do Mechanical Engineering instead – also maybe not the best choice considering my goal outlined above but at least I wouldn't be coding 24/7 for school.</p>



<p>Facebook was just taking off during my freshman year of college. They launched their original developer platform that fall and I was instantly hooked.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of free time building apps. Like this one that you could use to request phone numbers from your fiends.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5f24a618be311e3ae7628cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or this one which was a developer toolkit, making it easy to embed Facebook-style form elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e45bf5828be311e3b0bb28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or even my last solo Facebook endeavor, a monitoring tool for the Facebook Platform, which peaked at a grand total of 1 paying user.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e35826a88be311e3982b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can probably guess: my ROI wasn't too great. But I was very active in the Facebook developer community and made a name for myself. Facebook reached out and asked if I'd like to become a community moderator. I have to imagine this was because of my community participation and not because they looked at any of my app analytics. </p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5897b478be311e3a69228cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This moderator gig led me to write developer columns for Inside Facebook and in combination, these two things generally kept my around the platform much longer than I otherwise should have.</p>

<p>It did turn out to be useful though.</p>



<p>I was applying for summer engineering internships after my Junior year of college. I applied about two dozen engineering firms in Missouri as well as a few web development gigs.</p>

<p>Of all resume's I sent out I only heard back from one place, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>, a VA loan lender based in Columbia Mo. I learned they wanted to build an app for military personnel to reconnect inside of Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e4ebb0e88be311e3864128cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I worked on Military Basebook for about a year. It peaked around 20,000 monthly active users but ultimately wasn't sticky enough. Around this time I learned a few things:</p>

<p><em>1. Facebook apps that aren't games just don't work well</em></p>

<p>Even today the most successful apps on Facebook are games. Users on Facebook just aren't in mindset to seek out utilities.</p>

<p><em>2. I didn't want to do the traditional engineering career</em></p>

<p>Although the sentiment had been brewing for a while, that summer was a turning point where I actively decided I would focus on side projects post college instead of seeking a full time job. I was going to keep throwing stuff at the wall and see if something stuck.</p>

<p>I began my mechanical engineering masters program (which I ended up dropping out of) as part of this strategy. I was able to secure a 2-year grant which paid for school living expenses. This left me with a lot of free time for my side projects.</p>



<p>Around the middle of my junior year I discovered <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. If you're unfamiliar, it is a lot like Reddit (HN actually came first) where stories and articles are upvoted to the frontpage. Usually people post about programming and startups.</p>

<p>One convention on Hacker News is called “Show HN” which is a way for people to show off their side projects and solicit feedback.</p>

<p>One “Show HN” caught my eye by a user called <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/?user=phpnode">phpnode</a> (thank you phpnode!). He launched a side project called <a href="http://zpr.io/6dM7.png">Hackernewsers</a> which was a map of users who used Hacker News.</p>

<p>The idea was simple. You submit your username, real name, and location and you get access to a map where you can see others who've done the same. I checked out Columbia Mo. and I saw something interesting – there was someone else in the area! It turns out that other person was this guy:</p>

<p>[Bryan Helmig]</p>

<p>I remember clicking through all the information I could find online about him. I found his <a href="http://bryanhelmig.com/">personal blog</a>, some of his <a href="http://rankiac.com/">side projects</a>, and even <a href="http://youtube.com/">his YouTube channel</a>. But the most important thing I learned was that he worked at same company I did, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>.</p>

<p>That was enough of a connection for me so I got in touch over Facebook. We met up several times that year for beers and wanted to work on something together.</p>



<p>Mizzou, the university I attended in Columbia, sent out a weekly email with things happening on campus and in the area. I usually auto-archived these. I must have been pretty bored the day I <a href="http://google.com/">opened this one</a>, but I'm glad I did. I found an enticing headline “Startup Weekend is Coming to Columbia”.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Startup Weekend but I knew I liked building things, I knew I liked startups, so maybe this is something I wanted to be a part of. I then discovered tickets cost $50 and was a bit turned off.</p>

<p>Maybe if I could find someone else going, it would be worth the money. So I messaged Bryan and he said he was going! I bought tickets later that night, and that's how I wound up at Columbia Missouri's first ever Startup Weekend.</p>

<p>At Startup Weekend I formally met <a href="http://wadefoster.net/">Wade Foster</a> who also happened to work at Veterans United. We got together and worked on the project that Bryan originally pitched as “API Mixer”. The idea was simple: make a tool that enables anyone (marketers, sales, HR, developers) to connect together two web services they use.</p>

<p>In true startup fashion we took to the back garage and got to work. The <a href="https://zapier.com/blog">story of Zapier</a> is still being written today.</p>



<p>When I look back on the decisions that lead me to Startup Weekend I am amazed how many times the proverbial train of life could have been derailed.</p>

<p>What if I hadn't opened that email? What if I never got into Facebook development? What if I hadn't worked at Veterans United?</p>

<p>In reminds me a lot of the game Plinko on The Price is Right. The one where the contestant drops the puck down a pegged board and it randomly makes it's way down to one of the buckets at the bottom with the winning bucket in the middle.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9ed525578be311e39e8a28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plinko"></p>

<p>The funny thing about plinko is, if you run sufficiently many trials, the middle bucket is actually the easiest to hit! The outcome follows a normal distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9dfcebde8be311e3ae7b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plink Distrobution"></p>

<p>The take away here is if you go through life making random decisions, statistically, you'll wind up in the middle. While in Plinko the middle is the best, in reality, the really exciting stuff happens at the edges of the board. That's where Zapier happened. And to get there you've got to purposely push yourself towards the outsides.</p>

<p>Although I didn't realize it at the time, there was a guiding principle for all my decisions. I was always putting myself out there, in uncomfortable, new situations that challenged my own status quo.</p>

<p>That's the road to the outside of the Plinko board. And that's the biggest thing I learned by creating Zapier.</p>

<p>The Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that instructs us, how to organize data and function into objects. Those objects are structures that should be designed to reflect the real-world object. Fortunately, we have four principles defined: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation, that will lead us towards good code quality. Unfortunately, for years I understood them improperly, even if I was really convinced that I know them well. This article has to shorten your way to an understatement of OOP paradigm.</p>



<p>During this article, we will focus mostly on practice with a little theoretical background. Even if all code samples are included, you can clone <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/oop-kata" target="_blank">GIT repository with sources</a> and follow each change. At the end of the article, you can continue learning by doing kata. To simplify work, we will skip unit testing. Let’s check, what are we going to work on.</p>





<h2><span id="The_Washing_Machine">The Washing&nbsp;Machine</span></h2>



<p>Application, that we are working, is a representation of a washing machine. Seems like it is nothing special, just put clothes inside and start it, so the laundry is being done. On the other hand, when we start to gather requirements that ordinary washing machine has to do, it grows into at least a few point list.</p>



<ul><li>It must wash any laundry that we have</li><li>Must provide dedicated programs for a different type of fabric</li><li>Programs for fabrics must be adjustable in the matter of temperature and spin speed</li><li>It should not be possible to insert too many laundry into the washer</li></ul><p>We could add more and more requirements to the list, but let’s stop for now, and make those four a little bit more precise.</p>



<ul><li>Supported fabrics are wool, cotton and silk</li><li>Wool can be washed only in temperature up to 40°C, with spin speed between 100 and 400 rounds per minute</li><li>Cotton can be washed in temperature between 30 and 95°C, with spin speed up to 1200 RPM</li><li>The maximum temperature for silk is 30°C and up to 300 RPM</li><li>The default value for temperature and spin speed will be its maximum value</li><li>The washer should have protection for putting over 7 kilograms of laundries</li></ul><h3><span id="Development_of_the_first_version_of_the_application">Development of the first version of the application</span></h3>



<p>We are going to code the application in a way that some controller will provide laundry to the core of the application — the Washing Service. Washing Service will use the Washing Machine to perform wash. This version of the code will be a base for applying OOP principles. On purpose, we are going to design and implement it in a way that I have seen in multiple projects and companies. Writing Object-Oriented code is not only about using classes, but we also need to model it in a very precise way. For now, we will start with the following diagram.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="316" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1024x316.png" alt="Application desing might already say, that there is high probability of violating OOP principles." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1024x316.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-300x93.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-768x237.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1536x475.png 1536w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1.png 1563w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Simplified diagram for our application that violates OOP. It is composed of few classes.</figcaption></figure><p>We will start with defining two, the most valuable elements of the whole application: <code>Laundry</code> and <code>WashingMachine</code>. They are mentioned multiple times in the requirements, so let’s take a look at code that we are going, to begin with. You can also clone the GitHub repo and follow all the changes in your favourite IDE.</p>






<p>Base class that will keep laundry.</p>



<p>Supported fabric types are defined in the requirements, so we decided to keep them as an enum and hope it will not change pretty often.</p>






<p>Currently, our application will support three types of fabric.</p>



<p>The last thing from model classes is the washing machine itself. From the description, we may conclude that it will spin with different speeds and will do laundry at different temperatures. Also, it will, of course, perform wash and clean up the laundry.</p>






<p>Main, currently agnostic, Washing Machine class.</p>



<p>Model classes are fairly simple and represent object attributes pretty well. What we do not have here is the logic described in requirements for the application. We are going to implement it as a <code>WashingService</code>. The logic that will manage the washing process is represented by three <code>wash</code> methods.</p>



<p>We will focus on one of the methods, let’s say, <code>washWool</code> and later will duplicate the solution of all of the programs. Wool should be by default wash at a temperature of 40 degrees and with the spin speed set up to 400 RPM. Before we set up our laundry, we also have to sort it by fabric type and get only the ones that we are currently interested in. We need to remember also required check for each of the parameters, so we will not exceed values defined for a program.</p>






<p>The whole logic is currently in Service class, together with value checks.</p>



<p>Having washing logic in place, we need the last piece of the puzzle — something that will invoke the washing process. The controller here is responsible for obtaining all laundry and providing it to the <code>WashingService</code> so it will do the laundry. This part of the application can be changed, depending on the presentation layer, so we are not going to keep here any logic. Keeping logic apart from this class ensures us that all possible controllers will use the same process.</p>






<h2><span id="How_hard_we_broke_OOP">How hard we broke&nbsp;OOP?</span></h2>



<p>Even if you do not see it yet, we already violated Object-Oriented Principles pretty hard. A lot of logic is now in the service, that is very specific to washer programmes. In the matter of encapsulation, we are taking out the internals of the washing machine and perform some operations on it. It is equivalent to pouring water with a bucket into the washer, instead of letting washing machine to take up the right amount — it is clearly violating OOP’s principles. What would happen, if new requirements would appear, like no drain function or double rinse? Adding such features to the service will quickly make it hard to maintain. Pretty easily we will reach a dead-end when code becomes unmaintainable.</p>



<h3><span id="Problems_with_lack_of_Object-Oriented_approach">Problems with lack of Object-Oriented approach</span></h3>



<p>Till now, we have implemented an application that does not follow OOP principles, even if it might look to do. Our <code>WashingService</code> is on a good way to become a big class that handles all washing-related logic. It is visible, that we are facing some problems:</p>



<ul><li>Moving value checks from Washing Machine to Service may lead to inconsistency. All services using Washing Machine needs to know, what are its limitations. What will happen, if we will have another, smaller Washing Machine, that may operate only on a maximum of 5 kg of laundry? We would have to update all services that are using it.</li><li>Adding new service will require to implement exactly the same checks. If we would need to add a <code>DryingService</code>, then it is needed to duplicate the code. Logic centralized in service instead of the object makes it hard to be reused.</li><li>Extensive code is not easy to test. A lot of possible ways of execution for every method makes automated tests heavy (a lot of preparation) and overlapping (a common part of methods is tested by multiple tests)</li></ul><p>Without following OOP, classes and tests may become heavy. Right now, to fully test all paths within <code>washWool</code> method, we will need up to 32 unit test — just for this one method. I find it one of the core reasons for developers not writing unit tests — they are too big and require a lot of data preparation. Now we know, what is the problem with our code, and we do know how it should work. Time to make this code Object-Oriented!</p>



<h2><span id="Inheritance_of_clothes">Inheritance of&nbsp;clothes</span></h2>



<p>While going into a clothing store, you can choose from multiple fabrics that clothes are made, yet all clothes have the same abilities — they can be put on, worn, stained and cleaned. Depending on the way you are looking at clothes, they can be categorized by different characteristics. You can distinguish them by type of clothes (shirts, jackets, trousers), but they are still clothes.</p>



<p>Inheritance in OOP is something, that allows for generalisation of specific things. Depending on that with who you are talking to, you might need to be more specific, or perform conversation on a general level. For example, imagine a situation when you are walking into a store, and shop assistant approaches you. It would be more valuable to say that you need a pair of trousers than saying you need some clothes. On the other hand, while talking to a friend that you meet on a street, it is perfectly fine to say that you are going to buy some clothes. Inheritance allows you to refer to jackets and trousers as clothes.</p>



<h3><span id="Inheritance_vs_polymorphism">Inheritance vs polymorphism</span></h3>



<p>While inheritance is about copying behaviours and attributes, polymorphism is about changing behaviour in subclasses. In Java, they are strictly connected — if <code>Clothes</code> has a <code>cleanUp()</code> method, to change its behaviour we have to extend <code>Clothes</code> in <code>Jacket</code> class. So, in Java, the OOP polymorphism is fulfilled by extension.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-1024x614.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-1024x614.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-300x180.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-768x461.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>In Java, to realize OOP Polymorphism, we need to use inheritance</figcaption></figure><h3><span id="Applying_inheritance_to_washing_elements">Applying inheritance to washing&nbsp;elements</span></h3>



<p>Inheritance is clear <code>is-a</code> relation. If <code>Jacket</code> extends <code>Clothes</code>, then <code>Jacket is-a Clothes</code>. While thinking of laundry, we usually do not care if we are washing jackets or anything else. More important is the type of fabric – in our case they were distinguished by enum property. It works, but it is promoting direct access to the internals of the object. This may lead to breaking the encapsulation and gives the possibility to put the object into an invalid state. Having it in a property inside class requires you to search for this information inside the object – it is like looking for a clothes tag and reading it every time you want to wash this piece of clothes.</p>

To make <code>LaundryElement</code> class more OOP focused, we will have to do multiple things. Let’s start with making it an abstract class, so it will become the base for inheritance. Another small, but important step is making fields immutable where possible. This will prevent instances of this class being vulnerable to direct field changes. The only field that is mutating is the <code>dirty</code> flag.</p>



<p>To modify <code>dirty</code> flag, we will not use <code>set</code> method. Instead of that, we will hide it behind a …</p></div></div>

					<p>Deze week hebben we een stap gezet waarvan we dachten dat we hem nooit zouden moeten zetten: we hebben de NOS-logo`s laten verwijderen van de auto`s waarmee we elke dag op pad zijn om verslaggevers een werkplek te bieden en om radio- en televisieverbindingen met Hilversum te leggen. Voortaan zijn deze auto`s, kleine vrachtwagens eigenlijk, niet meer herkenbaar als auto`s van de NOS.</p>										<p>Helaas, het is nodig voor de veiligheid van de mensen die elke dag voor de NOS op pad zijn. We hebben er maanden over getwijfeld, we wilden het per se niet, want we willen als publieke journalistieke organisatie juist zichtbaar en aanspreekbaar zijn, maar het kan zo niet verder.</p>
<p>Vrijwel dagelijks worden collega`s die onderweg zijn, geconfronteerd met opgestoken middelvingers, er wordt afval naar ze gegooid, ze worden afgesneden op de snelweg en een enkeling remt zelfs hard vlak voor onze auto`s. Als zo`n NOS-auto stil staat om in te werken, wordt dat onmogelijk gemaakt door erop te bonzen. Als we worden uitgescholden en of in meer of mindere mate bedreigd, valt dat al bijna niet meer op.</p>
<p>En het gaat niet alleen om wat er feitelijk gebeurt, maar zeker ook om de angst dat je wat overkomt of wordt aangedaan.</p>
<p>Eerder namen we het besluit standaard bewaking meesturen als we verslag doen van publieksmanifestaties en nu dan de logo`s eraf. Zo diep zijn we gezonken en het verbijsterende is: het is allemaal in korte tijd snel anders geworden. Deze discussie kwam in het voorjaar op, maar toen nog zeiden de technici dat ze logo`s zeker niet kwijt wilden. Herkenbaarheid en trots op het bedrijf waar ze voor werken, gaven toen nog de doorslag.</p>
<p>De journalistiek ligt onder vuur van mensen en groeperingen, die alleen hun eigen wereld willen terugzien, elk ander perspectief onmogelijk proberen te maken en daarmee de persvrijheid aantasten. Dit besluit is een nederlaag voor de NOS, maar vooral voor de journalistiek. Bij <a href="https://www.persveilig.nl/">Persveilig</a> zijn binnen een jaar meer dan 100 meldingen van agressie tegen journalisten binnengekomen. De journalistiek is een fundament voor onze democratie, moet onbelemmerd kunnen functioneren en daarin gesteund worden. Juist nu en veel meer dan gebeurt.</p>

</p>
<br>

<div>
  <p>By <b>Julius Choudhury</b></p>
  
  <p>
    Businesses that need to raise funds in a hurry often have two options –
    borrow money from a lender or raise capital from investors. Both options
    have their benefits and drawbacks. By understanding the pros and cons of
    each, you can work out which is the best option for your business. Below are
    the two options weighed up.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Borrowing money</h3>
  <p>
    Many people find borrowing money to be a lot more straightforward than
    seeking investment. Nowadays, you can borrow money with the click of a
    button or the swipe of a card. You don’t even need to have a good credit
    score.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of course, when it comes to borrowing large amounts, the application process
    can be a little more complicated – you may need to present a business plan
    to someone in person. If you want access to low interest rates, a good
    credit score can also help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you take out a loan, you have to pay back the full amount regardless of
    whether your business succeeds or not. There are means of wiping debt, but
    often have to be on the verge of bankruptcy to consider these options. The
    flipside is that once your loan is paid off with interest, it’s gone
    forever, resulting in one less outgoing cost.
  </p>
  
  <div><p>
    You should always shop around before borrowing money to find the best
    interest rates and repayment schedule. This guide
    </p><u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2020/03/06/the-best-small-business-loans/" target="_blank">at Forbes</a></u><p>
    offers tips on finding the best business loan.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>Some different ways of borrowing money include:</p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Bank loans:</b> These loans tend to come with lower interest rates,
        but higher eligibility requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Private lenders:</b> These loans tend to come with lower eligibility
        requirements, but higher interest rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lines of credit:</b> These allow you to borrow money continuously up
        to a certain limit.
        <u><a href="https://edition.dearjulius.com/2019/02/4-reasons-to-use-credit-card-when.html" target="_blank">Credit cards</a></u>
        are reliant on a line of credit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Peer-to-peer lending:</b> This involves borrowing money from
        individual lenders.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Seeking investment</h3>
  <div><p>
    Seeking out investment involves offering shares in future profits in
    exchange for funding. It can be a little more complicated than applying to a
    loan – because investors are only certain to make a return if your business
    succeeds, you must prove to these investors that you are a successful
    business. This could mean having to present a detailed
    </p><u><a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-write-a-business-plan/" target="_blank">business plan</a></u><p>
    and make a pitch in some cases.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>
    Unlike a loan in which you owe a specific amount of money, the amount of
    money you owe to investors is completely dependent on how successful your
    business is. For many people, this can make it preferential to a loan. The
    one drawback is that you may pay investors more in the long run than you
    would pay a lender.
  </p>
  
  <div><p>
    Some investors and advisors may be able to offer expertise as well as
    helping you to achieve funding. When seeking investment and advice, it’s
    worth always looking up credentials of individuals and organizations such as
    these credentials of Adam Blumenthal
    </p><u><a href="https://www.businessnews.com.au/Person/Adam-Blumenthal" target="_blank">on Business News</a></u><p>. It could also be worth researching into past clients that they’ve worked
    with to get an idea of the businesses they invest in.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>A few different ways of seeking investment include:</p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Angel investors:</b> This generally involves seeking investment from
        a wealthy individual.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Venture capitalists:</b> These are organizations that tend to invest
        money into new rapidly growing businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Investment banks/advisors:</b> Investment banks help to connect
        companies with multiple individual investors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Crowdfunding:</b> Crowdfunding involves independently seeking
        investment from lots of different investors. Each investor usually only
        invests a small amount.
      </li>
    </ul>

					<div>
						<p>Ever since the development of the atomic bomb, humanity has possessed the means for its own destruction. There have, of course, always been natural risks of human extinction: an asteroid impact or a supervolcano eruption could make the planet uninhabitable. But since that fateful first nuclear test in the New Mexico desert, the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334769066_An_upper_bound_for_the_background_rate_of_human_extinction/fulltext/5d4043744585153e592e48be/An-upper-bound-for-the-background-rate-of-human-extinction.pdf?origin=publication_detail">primary threat</a> to the survival of human civilization has come from man himself.</p>
<p>In the decades since, the risks from human activity have multiplied. While the median climate change scenario would merely be unpleasant, there is the possibility of <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/fattaileduncertaintyeconomics.pdf">tail-end scenarios</a> that could end civilization as we know it. Advances in biotechnology might allow us to engineer a new pathogen that silently spreads before killing not just millions, but all of humanity. Some, like Elon Musk, fear that we might soon develop artificial intelligence that could go rogue.</p>
<p>Philosophers like <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html">Nick Bostrom</a>, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5506078de4b02d88372eee4e/t/5f36b015d9a3691ba8e1096b/1597419543571/Are+we+living+at+the+hinge+of+history.pdf">Derek Parfit</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911/ref=nodl_">Toby Ord</a> have become increasingly concerned about such so-called “existential risks.” An unrecoverable collapse of civilization wouldn’t just be tragic for the billions who would suffer and die. Perhaps the greatest tragedy would be the foreclosing of all of humanity’s potential. Humanity could flourish for billions of years and enable trillions of happy human lives—if only we do not destroy ourselves beforehand.</p>
<p>This line of thinking has led some to question whether “progress”—in particular, technological progress—is as straightforwardly beneficial as commonly assumed. Nick Bostrom imagines the process of technological development as “<a href="https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf">pulling balls out of a giant urn</a>.” So far, we’ve been lucky, pulling out a great many “white” balls that are broadly beneficial. But someday, we might pull out a “black” ball: a new technology that destroys humanity. Before that first nuclear test, some of the physicists worried that the nuclear bomb would ignite the atmosphere and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2015/07/23/the-man-who-feared-rationally-that-hed-just-destroyed-the-world/">end the world</a>. Their calculations ultimately deemed it “extremely unlikely,” and so they proceeded with the test—which, as it turns out, did not end the world. Perhaps the next time, we don’t get so lucky.</p>
<p>The same technological progress that creates these risks is also what drives economic growth. Does that mean economic growth is inherently risky? Economic growth has brought about extraordinary prosperity. But for the sake of posterity, must we choose safe stagnation instead? This view is arguably becoming ever-more popular, particularly amongst those concerned about climate change; Greta Thunberg recently denounced “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit?t=1602781084356">fairy tales of eternal economic growth</a>” at the United Nations.</p>
<p>I argue that the opposite is the case. <i>It is not safe stagnation and risky growth that we must choose between; rather, it is stagnation that is risky and it is growth that leads to safety.</i></p>
<p>We might indeed be in “time of perils”: we might be advanced enough to have developed the means for our destruction, but not advanced enough to care sufficiently about safety. But stagnation does not solve the problem: we would simply stagnate at this high level of risk. Eventually, a nuclear war or environmental catastrophe would doom humanity regardless.</p>
<p>Faster economic growth could initially increase risk, as feared. But it will also help us get past this time of perils more quickly. When people are poor, they can’t focus on much beyond ensuring their own livelihoods. But as people grow richer, they start caring more about things like the environment and protecting against risks to life. And so, as economic growth makes people richer, they will invest more in safety, protecting against existential catastrophes. As technological innovation and our growing wealth has allowed us to conquer past threats to human life like smallpox, so can faster economic growth, in the long run, increase the overall chances&nbsp; of humanity’s survival.</p>
<p>This argument is based on a <a href="http://leopoldaschenbrenner.com/xriskandgrowth">recent paper</a> of mine, in which I use the tools of economic theory—in particular, the standard models economists use to analyze economic growth—to examine the interaction between economic growth and the risks engendered by human activity.</p>
<p>In this model, society must choose how much of its resources to allocate to consumption and how much to safety efforts. Consumption makes us happy, but also creates risks of catastrophe. Investing in safety can in turn help mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>For example, consuming fossil fuels can engender great prosperity, but also increases the risk of tail-end climate change. We can spend money on carbon abatement to reduce this risk. Or consider air travel. It’s very useful as well, but also facilitates the spread of infectious diseases, including potentially a pandemic that could wipe out the human race. We can spend money on pandemic preparedness to mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>Crucially, society is impatient; it discounts the future. People generally care most about their more immediate well-being. Although they may care about their kids and grandkids, they are certainly not particularly concerned about the trillions of potential lives billions of years in the future that the aforementioned philosophers appeal to.</p>
<p>However, an impatient society <i>does</i> care about not getting wiped out. Therefore, what fraction of its resources this impatient society will allocate to safety depends on how much the people in this society value their own lives.</p>
<p>As it turns out, under the standard preferences used in economic theory, people value life more and more as they grow richer. This is because of the diminishing marginal returns of consumption. As you grow richer, using an extra dollar to purchase more consumption goods gives you less and less additional utility; meanwhile, as your life becomes better and better, you stand to lose more and more if you die. As a result, the richer people are, the greater the fraction of their income they are willing to sacrifice to protect their lives.</p>
<p>Comparing the current pandemic to the 1918 pandemic illustrates this phenomenon. Today, we are putting much of life on hold to minimize deaths. By contrast, in 1918, nonpharmaceutical interventions were milder and went on only <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27049#fromrss">for a month on average</a> in the U.S., even though the Spanish Flu was arguably deadlier and claimed younger victims. We are willing to sacrifice much more today than a hundred years ago to prevent deaths because we are richer and thus value life much more.</p>
<p>What does this mean for our model? Initially, a poor society will start out by allocating nearly all of its resources to consumption. And so as the economy grows, so does risk.</p>
<p>However, as people grow richer, they start valuing life more. They start investing in safety to mitigate risk, shifting more and more resources from consumption to safety. At this point, as the economy grows, risk begins to fall.</p>
<p>The risk of a existential catastrophe then looks like an inverted U-shape over time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53-300x191.png" alt="" width="666" height="424" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53-300x191.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53.png 628w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>The dot represents where we might be right now. Over the past centuries, as we have grown out of poverty, we have overwhelmingly focused on consumption. As a result, risk is growing.</p>
<p>But as we are growing richer, we are beginning to value life more, and are slowly investing more in safety. Eventually, we will have shifted enough resources to safety such that risk begins to fall—fall exponentially to zero, in fact, such that there is a positive probability of humanity surviving to reach a grand future. And all of this occurs despite our society’s impatience.</p>
<p>There is an analog to this in environmental economics, called the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve#Environmental_Kuznets_curve">environmental Kuznets curve</a>.” It was theorized that pollution initially rises as countries develop, but, as people grow richer and begin to value a clean environment more, they will work to reduce pollution again. That theory has arguably been vindicated by the path that Western countries have taken with regard to water and air pollution, for example, over the past century.</p>
<p>The idea that we are in a unique time in history in which we are facing an elevated risk of existential catastrophe is not new either. Carl Sagan was the one who coined the term “time of perils.” Derek Parfit called it the “hinge of history.” They <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5506078de4b02d88372eee4e/t/5f36b015d9a3691ba8e1096b/1597419543571/Are+we+living+at+the+hinge+of+history.pdf">argue</a> that the discoveries of the last centuries have granted humanity immense power, and so we are in a most “dangerous and decisive” period. But if we manage to survive, our descendants will be able to spread throughout the galaxy, making us much less vulnerable. They will have mastered new technologies that make us immune to bioengineered pathogens, neutralize the threat from atomic bombs, provide plentiful energy without destroying the environment, and keep artificial intelligence in check so it faithfully serves human needs. With their technology and wisdom, our descendants will be able to secure a long and safe future. Our challenge, then, is to make it through this unique perilous period.</p>
<p>Seeing the rising levels of existential risk over the past centuries, some might call for an end to economic growth. They might argue, rightfully so, that economic growth has only led to rising risk in the past.</p>
<p>Indeed, a period of accelerated economic growth would initially also accelerate the rise in risk. The level of risk might look something like this, where the lighter line is the path with accelerated growth:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42-300x201.png" alt="" width="666" height="446" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42-300x201.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>Even a few hundred years later, the critics of growth would seem to be vindicated! Faster growth just increased the risk!</p>
<p>Except that they are missing the whole picture:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29-300x187.png" alt="" width="666" height="415" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29-300x187.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>The accelerated economic growth also accelerated our path along the inverted-U shape of risk. Faster growth means people are richer sooner, so they value life more sooner, so society shifts resources to safety sooner—and ultimately we will begin the decline in risk sooner. As a result, the overall probability of an existential catastrophe—the area under the risk curve—declines!</p>
<p>Faster growth means we get through the “time of perils” more quickly. Indeed, stagnation would be the most dangerous choice of all: we would be stuck at an elevated level of risk, …</p></div></div></div>

<span>[Updated on 2019-04-18: this post is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08994">arXiv</a>.]</span></p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">Generative adversarial network</a> (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music. It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time. However, it is rather challenging to train a GAN model, as people are facing issues like training instability or failure to converge.</p>

<p>Here I would like to explain the maths behind the generative adversarial network framework,  why it is hard to be trained, and finally introduce a modified version of GAN intended to solve the training difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">Kullback–Leibler and Jensen–Shannon Divergence</h2>

<p>Before we start examining GANs closely, let us first review two metrics for quantifying the similarity between two probability distributions.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">KL (Kullback–Leibler) divergence</a> measures how one probability distribution \(p\) diverges from a second expected probability distribution \(q\).</p><p>

\[D_{KL}(p \| q) = \int_x p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx\]

</p><p>\(D_{KL}\) achieves the minimum zero when \(p(x)\) == \(q(x)\) everywhere.</p>

<p>It is noticeable according to the formula that KL divergence is asymmetric. In cases where \(p(x)\) is close to zero, but \(q(x)\) is significantly non-zero, the \(q\)’s effect is disregarded. It could cause buggy results when we just want to measure the similarity between two equally important distributions.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen–Shannon Divergence</a> is another measure of similarity between two probability distributions, bounded by \([0, 1]\). JS divergence is symmetric (yay!) and more smooth. Check this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Jensen-Shannon-divergence-used-more-often-than-the-Kullback-Leibler-since-JS-is-symmetric-thus-possibly-a-better-indicator-of-distance">Quora post</a> if you are interested in reading more about the comparison between KL divergence and JS divergence.</p><p>

\[D_{JS}(p \| q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p \| \frac{p + q}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(q \| \frac{p + q}{2})\]

</p><p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/KL_JS_divergence.png" alt="KL and JS divergence"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1. Given two Gaussian distribution, \(p\) with mean=0 and std=1 and \(q\) with mean=1 and std=1. The average of two distributions is labelled as \(m=(p+q)/2\). KL divergence \(D_{KL}\) is asymmetric but JS divergence \(D_{JS}\) is symmetric.</em></p>

<p>Some believe (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05101.pdf">Huszar, 2015</a>) that one reason behind GANs’ big success is switching the loss function from asymmetric KL divergence in traditional maximum-likelihood approach to symmetric JS divergence. We will discuss more on this point in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="generative-adversarial-network-gan">Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</h2>

<p>GAN consists of two models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A discriminator \(D\) estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It works as a critic and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones.</li>
  <li>A generator \(G\) outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input \(z\) (\(z\) brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution so that its generative samples can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/GAN.png" alt="Generative adversarial network"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. Architecture of a generative adversarial network. (Image source: <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-adversarial-networks-hot-topic-machine-learning.html">www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-…-learning.html</a>)</em></p>

<p>These two models compete against each other during the training process: the generator \(G\) is trying hard to trick the discriminator, while the critic model \(D\) is trying hard not to be cheated. This interesting zero-sum game between two models motivates both to improve their functionalities.</p>

<p>Given,</p>

      <td>Data distribution over real sample \(x\)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On one hand, we want to make sure the discriminator \(D\)’s decisions over real data are accurate by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\). Meanwhile, given a fake sample \(G(z), z \sim p_z(z)\), the discriminator is expected to output a probability, \(D(G(z))\), close to zero by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the generator is trained to increase the chances of \(D\) producing a high probability for a fake example, thus to minimize \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>When combining both aspects together, \(D\) and \(G\) are playing a <strong>minimax game</strong> in which we should optimize the following loss function:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\min_G \max_D L(D, G) 
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \\
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g(x)} [\log(1 - D(x)]
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>(\(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\) has no impact on \(G\) during gradient descent updates.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-value-for-d">What is the optimal value for D?</h3>

<p>Now we have a well-defined loss function. Let’s first examine what is the best value for \(D\).</p><p>

\[L(G, D) = \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D(x)) \bigg) dx\]

</p><p>Since we are interested in what is the best value of \(D(x)\) to maximize \(L(G, D)\), let us label</p><p>

\[\tilde{x} = D(x), 
A=p_{r}(x), 
B=p_g(x)\]

</p><p>And then what is inside the integral (we can safely ignore the integral because \(x\) is sampled over all the possible values) is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
f(\tilde{x}) 
&amp; = A log\tilde{x} + B log(1-\tilde{x}) \\

\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}}
&amp; = A \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{\tilde{x}} - B \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{1 - \tilde{x}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} (\frac{A}{\tilde{x}} - \frac{B}{1-\tilde{x}}) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{A - (A + B)\tilde{x}}{\tilde{x} (1 - \tilde{x})} \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus, set \(\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}} = 0\), we get the best value of the discriminator: \(D^*(x) = \tilde{x}^* = \frac{A}{A + B} = \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r}(x) + p_g(x)} \in [0, 1]\).</p>

<p>Once the generator is trained to its optimal, \(p_g\) gets very close to \(p_{r}\). When \(p_g = p_{r}\), \(D^*(x)\) becomes \(1/2\).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-global-optimal">What is the global optimal?</h3>

<p>When both \(G\) and \(D\) are at their optimal values, we have \(p_g = p_{r}\) and \(D^*(x) = 1/2\) and the loss function becomes:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
L(G, D^*) 
&amp;= \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D^*(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D^*(x)) \bigg) dx \\
&amp;= \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_{r}(x) dx + \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_g(x) dx \\
&amp;= -2\log2
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="what-does-the-loss-function-represent">What does the loss function represent?</h3>

<p>According to the formula listed in the <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/08/20/from-GAN-to-WGAN.html#kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">previous section</a>, JS divergence between \(p_{r}\) and \(p_g\) can be computed as:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) 
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{r} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{g} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_{r}(x) \log \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) + \\&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_g(x) \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log4 + L(G, D^*) \bigg)
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus,</p><p>

\[L(G, D^*) = 2D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) - 2\log2\]

</p><p>Essentially the loss function of GAN quantifies the similarity between the generative data distribution \(p_g\) and the real sample distribution \(p_{r}\) by JS divergence when the discriminator is optimal. The best \(G^*\) that replicates the real data distribution leads to the minimum \(L(G^*, D^*) = -2\log2\) which is aligned with equations above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Other Variations of GAN</strong>: There are many variations of GANs in different contexts or designed for different tasks. For example, for semi-supervised learning, one idea is to update the discriminator to output real class labels, \(1, \dots, K-1\), as well as one fake class label \(K\). The generator model aims to trick the discriminator to output a classification label smaller than \(K\).</p>

<h2 id="problems-in-gans">Problems in GANs</h2>

<p>Although GAN has shown great success in the realistic image generation, the training is not easy; The process is known to be slow and unstable.</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-achieve-nash-equilibrium">Hard to achieve Nash equilibrium</h3>

<p><a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6125-improved-techniques-for-training-gans.pdf">Salimans et al. (2016)</a> discussed the problem with GAN’s gradient-descent-based training procedure. Two models are trained simultaneously to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> to a two-player non-cooperative game. However, each model updates its cost independently with no respect to another player in the game. Updating the gradient of both models concurrently cannot guarantee a convergence.</p>

<p>Let’s check out a simple example to better understand why it is difficult to find a Nash equilibrium in an non-cooperative game. Suppose one player takes control of \(x\) to minimize \(f_1(x) = xy\), while at the same time the other player constantly updates \(y\) to minimize \(f_2(y) = -xy\).</p>

<p>Because \(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} = y\) and \(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} = -x\), we update \(x\) with \(x-\eta \cdot y\) and \(y\) with \(y+ \eta \cdot x\) simulitanously in one iteration, where \(\eta\) is the learning rate. Once \(x\) and \(y\) have different signs, every following gradient update causes huge oscillation and the instability gets worse in time, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/nash_equilibrium.png" alt="Nash equilibrium example"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 3. A simulation of our example for updating \(x\) to minimize \(xy\) and updating \(y\) to minimize \(-xy\). The learning rate \(\eta = 0.1\). With more iterations, the oscillation grows more and more unstable.</em></p>

        <p><span>I</span>n the mid-2020â€™s, NASA will launch a helicopter-like lander the size of a small car toward Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon. Nearly a decade later, after crossing about a billion miles of empty darkness, this spacecraft, dubbed Dragonfly, will gently settle onto Titanâ€™s sand dunes.&nbsp;There&nbsp;the sun will merely appear as a very bright star in the heavens and the Earth will barely be visible, like a floating mote of dust. The frigid temperatures will be colder than anywhere on Earth. But scientists believe this enigmatic world might harbor alien life.<br></p>

<p>Of all the planets, moons and asteroids in our solar system, Titan is a rarity. Along with Enceladus, another of Saturnâ€™s moons, and Europa, which orbits Jupiter, it is an ocean world, possessing flowing water and other liquids, organic materials, and an energy source that could provide just the right conditions for microbes to arise. Mars might be synonymous with pop-culture conceptions of aliens, but the Red Planet likely lacks those features and has been bone-dry and mostly atmosphere-less for some three billion years. These ocean worlds could be inhabited right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discovery of any kind of alien microbes on any of these worlds would be transformative, changing our prevailing views of life, its origins, and ultimately, ourselves. But if searches for life continue to turn up nothing, it may turn out that Earthlings have to explore much, much further to find fellow organisms in our galaxy.</p>
<p>â€œThese three moons in particular can help us test the hypothesis of whether life can naturally evolve in a place if you have all the ingredients it needs to survive,â€� says Morgan Cable, an astrochemist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and part of a cadre of astronomers who want to send robotic explorers to these moons. â€œOr is life super unique and weâ€™re horribly alone?â€�</p>
<p>Along with Dragonfly, NASA is also building the Europa Clipper, a lander slated to sail toward Jupiter's moon in the near future. And though a return to Enceladus is not high on the agencyâ€™s priorities, a collaboration with the Breakthrough Starshot Foundation could eventually get a mission off the ground. Titan will come first, though, making it the first ocean world—other than Earth, of course—to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>Titan will be the first ocean world<strong>—</strong>other than Earth<strong>—</strong>to be explored.</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes visible to the naked eye with its faint yellowish hue, Saturn has fascinated Persian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek and other stargazers for millennia. But it was Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan orbiting the sixth planet in 1655 using a telescope he built himself. Soon afterward, he discerned Saturnâ€™s rings and also spotted a clutch of its smaller moons, of which there are now known to be more than fifty. Huygens referred to the largest moon as Luna Saturni, and English astronomer John Herschel later gave it and other known moons names from Greek mythology. Those monikers stuck.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, data collected by the first Voyager probe during its brief, 37,000 mile-per-hour flyby revealed how surprisingly thick and opaque Titanâ€™s atmosphere is. Later came NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft, laden with sensitive instrumentation, which surveyed the ocean worlds and other moons until spectacularly ending its mission in 2017 by diving into Saturnâ€™s gaseous body. Before Cassini burned up, the data it sent back to Earth finally penetrated Titanâ€™s haze to map out its undulating plains, dunes, lakes, and craters.</p>
<p>Larger than our moon and even Mercury, which is roughly two-fifths the size of Earth, Titan hosts plenty of intriguingly unique environments. Nascent lifeforms might benefit from its bubbling ice volcanoes, with the heat and pressure from below thrusting up liquified, briny ice like flowing, molten rock on Earth. And Titan is occasionally bombarded by asteroids whose impacts could melt the ice frozen on its surface. But after a time the water they produce—and anything possibly living there—would inevitably freeze again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_32ad92099390210393fe7b2b51e82e8a.jpg" alt="Titan surface - artist rendering"><figcaption><span>Artistâ€™s visualization of hydrocarbon pools on Titan's rocky surface. </span><br><span>Steven Hobbs</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Titanâ€™s dense, calm, orange-tinted atmosphere stands out, too, as an uncommon feature of worlds in our solar system. â€œThe reason weâ€™re interested in life on Titan is because of its atmosphere,â€� says Catherine Neish, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. Nitrogen and other molecules undergo reactions with ultraviolet light from the sun and cosmic rays, which turns them into more complex molecules. â€œAt the end of the day,â€� says Neish, â€œyou have these hugely complicated organic molecules that slowly trickle down to the surface, meaning that the Titan surface is covered in them.â€�<br></p>
<p>The chemical conditions on the surface could pose an obstacle to possible fledgling microbes—provided theyâ€™re like anything scientists know on Earth. But scientists have also speculated about life as we <em>donâ€™t</em> know it. Clouds of methane and ethane drift over Titan; they rain onto its surface, forming rivers and streams that ooze into polar seas comparable in size to the Great Lakes on Earth. Itâ€™s the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to have vast quantities of liquid on its surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquids are a superb medium for bringing molecules together, forming new ones, and sweeping away waste. Eventually, somewhere, molecules can become more complex and make new copies of themselves, crossing the blurry boundary that some scientists and philosophers would call â€œlife.â€� The methane lakes of Titan would offer very different building blocks than do Earthâ€™s pools; microbes would have to eat acetylene and breathe hydrogen rather than oxygen, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alien life forms would also need to cope with temperatures down to âˆ’180 degrees Celsius—roughly twice as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth—and with methane being a poor medium for carbon-based organic molecules to dissolve in. That would limit the chemical possibilities, making it harder to break most chemical bonds, and crucially, it would result in slower chemical reactions. If microbes defied the odds and arose on the surface, then, their life cycle and ecological interactions would move very slowly compared to the processes thought to be involved in the beginnings of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists are keeping an open mind about lifeâ€™s myriad forms, including a chemistry alien to us, so they equip their probes with a variety of instruments and make their explorations as thorough as possible. But it's hard to look for something you've never seen before. â€œIt may be that life in a lake like that is very, very different and potentially unrecognizable compared to life as we know,â€� says Cable. â€œWe donâ€™t want to miss it by accident because weâ€™re biased by Earth life.â€�</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_13df004fcabca482b041f97e46687a81.jpg" alt="High-Temperature-Beebe-Vents-Black-Smokers"><figcaption><span>A hydrothermal vent in the Cayman Trough, three miles below sea level, may be similar to vents on Enceladus. </span><br><span>Chris German/WHOI/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>M</span>ethane lakes are not the only potential cradle for Titanian life. Titan, as well as Europa and Enceladus, have relatively warm oceans underground. Titanâ€™s salty waters are hidden beneath an icy crust 100 kilometers thick, blocking already-feeble light from the distant sun, so photosynthesis would be impossible. But it is possible that on some of the ocean worlds, alien microbes could instead glean energy from hydrothermal—hot water—vents found near volcanoes rising from the bottom of these vast oceans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Earth, the movement of tectonic plates cracks the planetâ€™s rocky crust and creates such fissures. On the ocean worlds, the necessary force is provided by the constant gravitational pull of close orbits around the colossi of Saturn and Jupiter. Water percolating into cracking rock can then release energy.</p>
<p>â€œThe great thing about hydrothermal vents is that they provide a lot of energy sources for microbial life that doesnâ€™t include sunlight,â€� says Julie Huber, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Organisms living at hydrothermal vents on Earthâ€™s seafloors, she explains, â€œcan use chemical energy, so that means things like sulphur, iron, hydrogen and methane and they create a base of the food chain.â€�</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, oceanographers towing cameras on miles-long cables through the GalÃ¡pagos Rift in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, near the islands of the same name, collected the first clear evidence of hydrothermal vents. Theyâ€™ve subsequently been found scattered in seafloor volcanic areas near the edges of tectonic plates throughout the worldâ€™s ocean, spewing superheated, mineral-rich fluids that generate chemical reactions as they burble into the cold seawater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem challenging for anything to subsist in these harsh, bleak places. In fact, such environments typically offer wide ranges of temperature, pressure, acidity and energy, meaning that a diversity of microbial life is actually possible. Itâ€™s been theorized that life on Earth actually originated around hydrothermal vents rather than in primordial soup at the planet's surface, and some hardy organisms thrive there: mainly specially adapted bacteria and single-celled creatures known as archaea. Even in the ostensibly deadest spot on Earth, the nutrient-starved South Pacific Gyre east of Australia, scientists recently found microbes that apparently survived for millions of years in a form of stasis while embedded in the seafloor.</p>
<p>Vent fields off Costa Rica and in the Caribbeanâ€™s deep Cayman Trough are thought to be similar an undersea spot on Enceladus, and the connection between hydrothermal vents on Earth and potentially similar spots on ocean worlds has spurred collaborations between astrobiologists and oceanographers like Huber. The nascent deep-sea mining industry is interested, too, though for different reasons: the mineral-rich sulfide deposits include some valuable metals in dwindling supply on land, like manganese, copper, nickel and …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Previously I’ve decided to implement a rather basic <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/">raycasting engine in ClojureScript</a>.
It was a lot of fun, an interesting experience, and ClojureScript was awesome.
I’ve implemented small <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/#labyrinth-game">labyrinth game</a>, and thought about adding more features to the engine, such as camera shake, and wall height change.
But when I’ve started working on these, I quickly understood, that I’d like to move on to something more interesting, like real 3D rendering engine, that also uses rays.</p>
<p>Obviously, my first though was about writing a ray-tracer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This technique is wide known, and gained a lot of traction recently.
With native hardware support for ray tracing, a lot of games are using it, and there are a lot of tutorials teaching how to implement one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
In short, we cast a bunch of rays in 3D space, and calculate their trajectories, looking for what ray will hit and bounce off.
Different materials have different bounce properties, and by tracing rays from camera to the source of light, we can imitate illumination.
There are also a lot of different approaches how to calculate bouncing, e.g. for global illumination, and ambient light, but I’ve felt that it is a rather complicated task, for a weekend post.
And unlike raycasting, most ray-tracers require polygonal information in order to work, where raycasting only need to know wall start and end points.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted a similar approach for 3D rendering, where we specify an object in terms of it’s mathematical representation.
Like for sphere, we’ll just specify coordinate of a center, and a radius, and our rays will find intersection points with it, providing us a sufficient data to draw this sphere on screen.
And recently, I’ve read about a similar technique, that uses rays for drawing on screen, but instead of casting infinite rays as in raycasting, it marches a ray in terms of steps.
And it also uses a special trick, to make this process very optimized, therefore we can use it for rendering real 3D objects.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to structure this post similarly to the one about raycasting, so this will be another long-read, often more about Fennel rather than raymarching, but at the end I promise that we’ll get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/end-result.png"> 
</figure>

<p>So, just as in raycasting, first we need to do is to understand how raymarching engine works <em>on paper</em>.</p>
<h2 id="raymarching-basics">Raymarching basics</h2>
<p>Raymarching can be illustrated similarly to raycaster, except it requires more steps until we could render our image.
First, we need a camera, and an object to look at:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Our first step would to cast a ray, however, unlike with raycasting, we’ll cast a portion of a ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-short-ray.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We then check, if the ray intersects with the sphere.
It’s not, so we do one more step:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-two-steps.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>It’s not intersecting yet, so we repeat again:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-ray-overshoot.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Oops, ray overshoot, and is now inside the sphere.
This is not really good option for us, as we want for our rays to end directly at the object’s surface, without calculating intersection point with the object itself.
We can fix this by casting shorter ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-small-rays.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>However, this is very inefficient!
And besides, if we’ll change the angle a bit or move the camera, we will overshoot again.
Which means that we’ll either have incorrect result, or require a very small step size, which will blow up computation process.
How we can fix this?</p>
<h3 id="distance-estimation">Distance estimation</h3>
<p>The solution to this is a signed distance function, or a so called Distance Estimator.
Imagine if we knew how far we are from the object at any point of time?
This would mean that we can shoot a ray of this length in any direction and still don’t hit anything.
Let’s add another object to the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/scene-with-two-objects.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s draw two circles, which will represent distances from the objects, to the point from where we’ll cast rays:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/distances.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that there are two circles, and one is bigger than another.
This means, that if we choose the shortest safe distance, we can safely cast ray in any direction and not overshoot anything.
For example, let’s cast a ray towards the square:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/ray-in-safe-zone.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that we haven’t reached the square, but more importantly we did not overshoot it.
Now we need to march the ray again, but what distance should it cover?
To answer this question, we need to take another distance estimation from ray end to the objects in the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/second-safe-march.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Once again we choose shorter distance, and march towards the square, then get the distance again, and repeat the whole process:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/another-safe-match.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that with each step the distance to the object becomes smaller, and thus we will never overshoot the object.
However this also means, that we will take a lot of really small steps, until we finally fully hit the object, if we ever do.
This is not a good idea, because it is even more inefficient than using fixed distance, and produces too accurate results, which we don’t really need.
So instead of marching up until we exactly hit the object, we will march <em>enough</em> times.
E.g. until the distance to the object is small enough, then there’s no real point to continue marching, as it is clear that we will hit the object soon.
But this also means, that if the ray goes near the edge of an object, we do a lot of expensive steps of computing distance estimations.</p>
<p>Here’s a ray that is parallel to the side of the square, and marches towards the circle:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/expensive-marching.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We do a lot of seemingly pointless measurements, and if a ray was closer to the square’s side, we would do even more steps.
However this also means, that we can use this data (since we’re already computed it) to render such things as glow, or ambient occlusion.
But more on this later.</p>
<p>Once ray hit an object we have all the data we need.
Ray represents a point on the screen, and the more rays we cast the higher resolution of our image will be.
And since we’re not using triangles to represent objects, our spheres will always be smooth, no matter how close we are to it, because there’s no polygons involved.</p>
<p>This is basically it.
Ray marching is quite simple concept, just like raycaster, although it’s a bit more complicated, as we do have to compute things in 3D space now.
So let’s begin implementing it by installing required tools, and setting up the project.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>As you know from the title we will use two main tools to create ray-marcher, which are <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>, a free game engine, and <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a> the programming language.
I’ve chosen Fennel, because it is a Lisp like language, that compiles to Lua, and I’m quite a fan of Lisps.
But we also needed to draw somewhere, and I know no GUI toolkit for Lua.
But there is LÖVE - a game engine that runs Lua code, which is capable on running on all systems, thus a perfect candidate for our task.</p>
<p>Installation steps may differ per operating system, so please refer to manuals<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
At the time of writing this post I’m using Fedora GNU/Linux, so for me it means:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ sudo dnf install love luarocks readline-devel
$ luarocks install --local fennel
$ luarocks install --local readline <span># requires readline-devel</span>
$ <span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.luarocks/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It’s better to permanently add <code>$HOME/luarocks/bin</code> (or another path, if your installation differs) to the <code>PATH</code> variable in your shell, in order to be able to use installed utilities without specifying full path every time.
You can test if everything is installed correctly, by running <code>fennel</code> in you command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ fennel
Welcome to Fennel 0.5.0 on Lua 5.3!
Use (doc something) to view documentation.
&gt;&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>For other distributions installation steps may vary, and for Windows, I think it’s safe to skip the <code>readline</code> part, which is fully optional, but makes editing in a REPL a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, let’s create the project directory, and the <code>main.fnl</code> file, where we will write our code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ mkdir love_raymarching
$ <span>cd</span> love_raymarching
$ touch main.fnl
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!
We can test if everything works by adding this code to <code>main.fnl</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>fn </span><span>love.draw</span> []
  (<span>love.graphics.print</span> <span>"It works!"</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can compile it with <code>fennel --compile main.fnl &gt; main.lua</code>, thus producing the <code>main.lua</code> file, and run <code>love .</code> (dot is intentional, it indicates current directory).</p>
<p>A window should appear, with white text <code>It works!</code> in upper left corner:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/love-works.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Now we can begin implementing our raymarcher.</p>
<h2 id="scene-setup">Scene setup</h2>
<p>Just as in raycaster, we need a camera that will shoot rays, and some objects to look at.
Let’s begin by creating a camera object, that will store coordinates and rotation information.
We can do so, by using <code>var</code> to declare a variable that is local to our file, and that we can later change with <code>set</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>var </span><span>camera</span> {<span>:pos</span> [0.0 0.0 0.0]
             <span>:x-rotate</span> 0.0
             <span>:z-rotate</span> 0.0})
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Lisps, and especially Clojure, let me quickly explain what this syntax is.
If you know this stuff, feel free to <a href="#org6f2d291">skip this part</a>.</p>
<p>We start by using a <code>var</code> special form, that binds a value to a name like this: <code>(var name value)</code>.
So if we start the REPL, using <code>fennel</code> command in the shell, and write <code>(var a 40)</code>, a new variable <code>a</code> will be created.
We then can check, that it has the desired value by typing <code>a</code>, and pressing return:</p>
<p>We can then alter the contents of this variable by using <code>set</code> special form, which works like this <code>(set name new-value)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>set </span><span>a</span> (<span>+ </span><span>a</span> 2))
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
42
</code></pre></div><p>Now to curly and square brackets.
Everything enclosed in curly braces is a hashmap.
We can use any Lua value as our key, and the most common choice is a string, but Fennel has additional syntax for defining keys - a colon followed by a word: <code>:a</code>.
This is called a keyword, and in Fennel it is essentially the same as <code>"a"</code>, but we don’t need to write a pair of quotes.
However keywords can’t contain spaces, and some other symbols.</p>
<p>So writing this <code>{:a 0 :b 2 :c :hello}</code> in the REPL will make a new table, that holds three key value pairs, which we can later get with another syntax - the dot <code>.</code>.
Combining it with <code>var</code>, we can see that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>var </span><span>m</span> {<span>:a</span> 1 <span>:b</span> 2 <span>:c</span> <span>:hello</span>})
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>. </span><span>m</span> <span>:b</span>)
2
</code></pre></div><p>There’s also a shorthand for this …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p><em>This article is based on a book chapter from my upcoming book <strong>“From One to Zero: A Minimalistic Approach to Programming”</strong>. </em></p>



<p>My <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/" title="Subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programming students</a> often write in with their struggles and failures. Many students ultimately overcome their struggles—but a large percentage of them <strong><em>give up their programming ambitions</em></strong> after realizing how hard creating software can be. These students started with the goal of becoming professional coders, but, ultimately, they missed that target. </p>



<p>After thousands of personal conversations with these students, it became apparent that many new coders don’t fail because they don’t know one or the other Python feature or because they lack technical skills, intelligence, or even talent. </p>



<p>These are not the underlying reasons <strong><em>why </em></strong>they fail. </p>



<p>Instead, they fail because they are<strong> overwhelmed by the complexity lurking everywhere in programming</strong>. The complexity causes them to throw in the towel. This is unfortunate because there are many ways to mitigate the harmful effects of complexity in programming. In the previous chapter, you’ve already learned some strategies about the <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/the-80-20-principle-in-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="The 80/20 Principle in Programming"><strong>80/20 principle</strong></a> (Focus on the vital few and sacrifice the trivial many!).</p>



<p>In this chapter, we’re going to have a comprehensive look at this important and highly underexplored topic. <strong>What exactly is complexity?</strong> Where does it occur? How does it look like?</p>



<p>Let’s start with a quick overview—there’s significant complexity in selecting the right</p>



<ul><li>programming language among dozens of popular languages,</li><li>coding project to work on—from thousands of open-source projects and myriads of problems,</li><li>libraries within a language (<a href="https://blog.finxter.com/why-does-the-scikit-learn-library-use-a-trailing-underscore-convention-for-attribute-names/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Why Does the Scikit-learn Library use a Trailing Underscore Convention for Attribute Names?">scikit-learn</a> vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/numpy-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="NumPy Tutorial – Everything You Need to Know to Get Started">NumPy </a>vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/2-min-computer-science-papers-tensorflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[2-min CS Papers] A Short Introduction to the TensorFlow System">TensorFlow</a>),</li><li>emerging technologies to “bet on”—Alexa apps, smartphone apps, browser-based web apps, integrated Facebook or WeChat apps, virtual reality apps—and</li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">coding editor</a> such as PyCharm, IDLE, and Atom.</li></ul>



<p>Given the great confusion caused by these sources of complexity, it’s no surprise that<strong><em> “How to start?”</em></strong> is one of the most common questions from programming beginners. </p>



<p>To answer the question right away, the best way to start is <strong><em>not </em></strong>by choosing a programming book and reading over all <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/python-crash-course/" title="Python Programming Tutorial [+Cheat Sheets]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syntactical features</a> of the programming language. Surprisingly, these coding books sell well—even I am a<a href="https://coffeebreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://coffeebreakpython.com/"> seller of such books</a>. However, interacting with thousands of programming students personally I realized that many ambitious students buy programming books as a commitment device to put the learning task on their ToDo lists—if they’ve spent money on the book, they better read it or the investment will be lost. But as so many other tasks on their ToDo lists, reading a programming book is seldomly one to be completed. </p>



<p><strong>Many students buy these programming tutorial books but very few actually read them.</strong></p>



<p>So, what is the <strong><em>best way to start to learn to program</em></strong>? In my opinion, the best way to start is to choose a practical code project—a simple one if you’re a beginner—and push it to completion. </p>



<ul><li>Don’t read coding books before you do this. </li><li>Don’t read random tutorials on the web. </li><li>Don’t scroll through endless feeds on StackOverflow. </li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Just set up the project and start coding with the limited skills you have</em></strong> and your common sense. </p>



<p>It’s okay if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you will gradually increase your understanding. You read books and articles only to make progress on the project in front of you. By diving into the process of finishing your first project, you need to solve a number of highly relevant problems: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">Which code editor should you use? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/install-python-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Install Python on Windows? [7 Easy Steps]">How to install Python? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-read-all-lines-of-a-file-in-a-python-one-liner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Read All Lines of a File in a Python One-Liner?">How to read input from a file? </a></li><li>How to store the input in your program for later use? </li><li>How to manipulate the input to obtain the desired output?</li></ul>



<p>By answering these questions, you gradually build a well-rounded skill set of a practitioner. Over time, you’ll answer these questions better and better. Your speed and skill to solve these problems will grow. You’ll be able to solve similar problems much bigger and you’ll create your internal database of programming patterns and conceptual insights. Even advanced coders learn and improve with the exact same process—only the coding projects have become much larger and more complicated.</p>



<p>Let’s assume you adopt this <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-start-your-freelancing-business-on-the-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[7 Steps] How to Start Your Freelancing Business on the Side?">project-based learning approach</a>. You focus on a single project and work on it for a considerable amount of time. What is your biggest enemy now? You guessed it: <strong><em>complexity</em></strong>.</p>



<p>You’ll struggle with complexity in:</p>



<ul><li>finding bugs in ever-growing codebases,</li><li>understanding code components and how they interact,</li><li>choosing the right feature to be implemented next,</li><li>understanding the mathematical and conceptual basics of the code.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Complexity is everywhere</strong>, at every stage of a project that comes to life. And the hidden costs of this complexity are very tangible: coders who are just starting out throw in the towel and the projects never see the light of day. The beginner argues: <em>“coding is too difficult for me”</em> and he truly believes it—even though nothing can be further from the truth.</p>



<p>The root of the problem is overwhelming complexity and a lack of focus. So, the question arises: </p>



<p><strong><em>How to solve complexity and a lack of focus?</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Minimalism" width="844" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>The answer is straightforward, and I’ve already stressed it a few times in this book: <strong>minimalism</strong>. Seek simplicity and focus – in every stage of the coding cycle. I want you to take this one concept out of the book: Take a radically minimalistic position in every area you’ll encounter in the programming space. If this book can convince you to take more extreme measures to increase your focus, it has accomplished its mission!</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper into the concept of complexity to develop an understanding of one of the great enemies of your coding productivity.</p>




<h2><span id="What_is_Complexity"></span>What is Complexity?<span></span></h2>



<p>In different fields, the term complexity comes with different meanings. Sometimes, it’s strictly defined, such as in computational complexity of a computer program that provides a means to analyze a given code function for varying inputs. Other times, it’s loosely defined as the amount or structure of interactions between system components. But in this book, we’re going to use it in a more generic way.</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster dictionary defines complexity as <em>“something complex”</em>. The term complex is defined as <em>“a whole made up of complicated […] parts”</em>. If you resolve the term complicated—<em>“difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>—you end up with the following rough definition:</p>



<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: <em>“a whole, made up of parts, that is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>.</p>



<p>This is how we use the term complexity in this book. Complexity describes a whole system or entity. It is difficult to explain or describe. Because of its difficulty, complexity causes struggle and confusion. When confronted with complexity, people find themselves cognitively unable to comprehend the deeper meaning, implications, or effects of “the whole”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Complexity" width="450" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>They cannot see the big picture—complexity is the enemy of clarity, closure, and predictability, because a complex system behaves in highly unpredictable ways. Where do you find complexity? You’ll find it everywhere, because real-world systems are messy: A highly interrelated web of causes and effects that obfuscates the behavior of a real system, and that is impossible to decode for individuals who are themselves caught in this complex web. Like a differential equation, the output of one system feeds into another system’s input which, in turn, feeds back into the first system as an input. Examples of highly complex systems are the stock market, social trends, emerging political viewpoints, and big computer programs with hundreds of thousands of lines of code—such as the Windows operating system.</p>



<p>If you are a coder, you are especially prone to overwhelming complexity. Let’s dive into different sources of complexity in the field of programming:</p>



<ul><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li><li>Complexity in Software and Algorithmic Theory</li><li>Complexity in Learning</li><li>Complexity in Processes</li><li>Complexity in Social Networks</li><li>Complexity in Your Daily Life</li><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li></ul>



<p>The best way to learn and create lasting value is through your participation or initiation of a real-world project. But how does it look like when a real-world project comes to life? Let’s dive into the different stages of the project lifecycle: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment (see Figure 1).</p>



<p><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: A software project comes to life – the project lifecycle consists of six conceptual phases: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, Deployment.</em></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="340" src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" data-src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w"></figure></div>



<p>Figure 1 shows the software development life cycle consisting of six phases. Even if you’re working on a very small software project, you’re likely going through all six phases of the software development lifecycle. Next, you’ll quickly dive into all six phases—and how complexity has a significant impact on every one of them.</p>



<h3><span id="Planning"></span>Planning<span></span></h3>



<p>The first stage of the software development life cycle is the planning phase. From software engineering literature, you may know this as <strong><em>requirement analysis</em></strong>. The purpose of this phase is to determine how the end product will look like. A successful planning phase leads to a strictly defined set of required features to deliver to the customer or the end user.</p>



<p>The planning phase solves a multi-dimensional problem where different departments and functions must collaborate to determine the optimal set of features of the software. A number of factors must be taken into consideration: the costs of building a feature, the risk of not being able to successfully implement the feature, the expected value for the end user, marketing and sales implications, maintainability, scalability, legal restrictions and many more.</p>



<p>This phase is crucial because it can save you from massive wastages of downstream energy in the following phases. Business owners know that <strong><em>capital allocation</em></strong> (or …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Pursuing a non-conventional path</h3><p>Between 2015 and 2020 I have participated in <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> tournaments. Being involved in these tournaments has led me to a <strong>very profitable journey</strong>: I made around $350k during these years.</p><p>Many people have reached out to me and asked how I did it. I decided to write this post to inspire others with this <strong>non-conventional path</strong>.</p><h4>Selling a Trading Algorithm</h4><p>In 2015 <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> was one of my interests. This is how I came across <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, a platform that provides data and tools so anyone can develop and test trading algorithms. After learning the basics and playing around with the platform I decided to submit an algorithm to their recently created tournament.</p><p>The algorithm was pretty basic but surprisingly it remained in the <strong>top 10 for a few weeks</strong>. I received many messages: companies suggesting to join them as a Financial Quant, people interested in my approach, and a few offers from people interested in buying the algorithm.</p><p>One of those potential buyers was particularly interested, shockingly enough, even after I explained him how simple my algorithm was. I eventually shared the code with him for free. Still, he expressed his desire to send me the amount he offered in the first instance. And that's how I made <strong>the first $2k out of participating in ML/financial tournaments.</strong></p><h4>Getting The Dream Job</h4><p>During these weeks I exchanged many emails with Apple employees, financial quants, people from Europe, Asia, or America. But the best interaction came from a guy from my town. He was building his own trading algorithm and was interested in my approach. I meet him a couple of times. Obviously, his knowledge was years ahead of where I was at that time.</p><p>Those meetings were very productive, especially for me. After discussing with him about our personal and professional interests, and how difficult it was to find good jobs in our city, he introduced me to my next employer. Of course, I was not aware of it at that time. He introduced me to the CEO of an ad-tech company, and at first glance I saw many things in common between this sector and <strong>high-frequency trading</strong>. The offered position (not publicly opened at that time) would also allow me to face and try to solve many machine learning, big data and architectural challenges.</p><p>After a few weeks and a couple of meetings, I decided that the company was a really good fit, a place where I would continue professionally growing and developing as a <strong>data scientist and engineer</strong>.</p><p>During years we worked on building a solid <strong>platform that led us to be acquired in 2018</strong>. The experience was great and the outcome even better. Including the exit bonus I made a big sum during this period.</p><h4>The Altcoins Trading Madness</h4><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c9snCN/Cf-DCZLm-WEAACt-ZS.jpg" alt="Numerai Tournament Leaderboard"></figure><p>In 2016, I discovered the <a href="https://numer.ai/tournament">Numerai Tournament</a>, "the hardest data science tournament on the planet" as they claim. Numerai is a weekly global <strong>data science tournament</strong> to solve the stock market. Data scientists work with clean, regularized, and obfuscated datasets provided by Numerai to create machine-learning models to predict the stock market. <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> builds a meta model of the most unique and contributive predictions, and uses this to command the capital in its global equity hedge fund.</p><p>In early 2016 I had finished a <strong>few rounds in good spots</strong>, as you can see in the image. After a few months of actively participating, I ended 2016 with around 0.5 BTC. It was cool but it required too much of my time. I had other priorities, so I withdrew the earnings and left the tournament.</p><p>Almost a year later a post about a Numerai airdrop came across my timeline. After login back to my account I discovered I received 1800 NMR.</p><p>At that time, the amount was valued around $30k, so I initially decided to withdraw almost everything, but something changed my mind and I started <strong>buying and selling altcoins</strong>. After some back and forth, and some lucky movements, I ended accumulating a wallet valued around $100k.</p><p>2017 was arriving at his end and I took <strong>the last lucky movement</strong>, I withdrew half of that sum a few weeks before the bitcoin crash. I still hold the other half but it wasn't easy to stick to that decision during 2018, while cryptos prices continued decreasing.</p><h4>The Compound Effect</h4><p>In July 2018, I came back to Numerai Tournament. I made some submissions but I didn't take it seriously again until mid-2019.</p><p>Since then I have a <strong>cumulative return of +141%</strong>. I have built an algorithm with an average weekly return of +2%, which taking into account the compounding effect it translates to <strong>+180% annualized total return</strong>.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>I'm going to continue participating in the Numerai Tournament, if everything continues as it is now, it would provide a good income without requiring much effort. I will also continue taking <strong>small bets</strong>, experimenting with other projects, continue doing things I like, and <strong>learning in the process</strong>.</p><p>I share similar histories in Twitter, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/jrdi">follow me there</a> as I continue to document my journey.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Too many open source projects die because developers burn out to deliver fantastic software in their free time. That’s not how it should be, so what’s the alternative? We researched the topic and concluded there is not that one answer to the question.</p>
<p>What works for you depends on your project’s type, what you want to do, who you develop the software for, and many more things. Here is a list of ideas you can try or even combine to make money with your open source projects. Hopefully, that helps you to free more time for the things you love to work on.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>People are kind, so why not adding a donate button to your README? That’s an easy way to get a little money for your work. Unfortunately, that didn’t work for us. We asked for donations for our work on tiptap, a popular package that took us a few hundred hours to develop.</p>
<p>Hundreds of developers, companies, and even a few big corporations use it, but we earned less than $300 through PayPal donations over the last three years. Don’t get me wrong, we are very thankful for every dollar, but this makes an hourly rate of less than $1. That’s not sustainable, and not enough to work less on client projects and more on the bespoken project.</p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>Your source code can stay open source, but add a license that requires people to pay for permission to use it in their projects. And to keep it fair, you can exclude non-commercial projects, non-profit organizations, students, and other open source projects.</p>
<p>Note, it might be hard to enforce the license for publicly accessible source code.</p>
<h2 id="goodwill-licenses">Goodwill licenses</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time enforcing a license, you could sell a goodwill license. It’s in between donations and regular licenses, where you kindly ask the users of your project to pay. But inside companies, it’s easier to argue for paying for a license than for a donation.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Some developers or companies need support to use your software. You can offer them support contracts, e. g. to promise a short response time for bug reports or availability for calls. Some companies require this level of support, some will use it extensively, and some won’t ever use it.</p>
<p>Offering support can work well for teams but can be a distraction from the work they are good at for single developers.</p>
<h2 id="contracting">Contracting</h2>
<p>If you open sourced something like a complex library, companies might want to hire you to implement your solution in their system. They know that you are the expert for the software you’ve written and happily pay you, even if it’s more than an average freelancer rate.</p>
<p>If you enjoy open source because you didn’t want to work with clients, that’s probably not for you. On the other hand, you’ll always use your code, which will help better understand the needs to implement your software.</p>
<h2 id="dual-licensing">Dual licensing</h2>
<p>Your software can have multiple licenses. For example, a basic version can be free for everyone, while another version, probably more tailored to what companies need, can be licensed differently.</p>
<p>Your publicly accessible software still allows collaboration. You would probably want to keep the advanced version closed to enforce the license. Keep in mind that maintaining different versions of software in parallel is more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="freemium">Freemium</h2>
<p>Also, consider offering a free version for everyone and add a few benefits for professional use that are only available for paying users.</p>
<p>Those extra benefits can be access to more features/plugins or other things like a community with restricted access.</p>
<h2 id="managed-hosting">Managed hosting</h2>
<p>If your software needs hosting and can be self-hosted, consider offering a managed hosting solution. Many people don’t want to operate their instance and happily pay you to do that for them.</p>
<p>You need to develop something to sell it, provision new instances, and maintain them. It’s a very fair approach and can work well, as you’ll always have people paying for convenience.</p>

<p>There are so many platforms tailored to easily offer sponsorship subscriptions to your users that you should think about adding this. But be aware that it’s the same as with donations. You won’t get many sponsors, but it’s recurring revenue that can help you feel safe.</p>
<h2 id="day-job">Day job</h2>
<p>Some companies make open source part of your day job. If you don’t need to work on an own project, but love a regular job’s safety, consider looking for such an employer.</p>
<p>By the way, we’re looking for a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/frontend-engineer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">frontend engineer</a> and a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/php-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PHP developer</a>, both roles include working on existing and new open source projects.</p>

<p>People always request features. Try turning feature requests into sponsored work, and offer to add those features in exchange for money. If multiple users or companies ask for the same functionality, you can even offer to share the development costs. Don’t forget to mention your sponsors in the release notes!</p>
<h2 id="bounties">Bounties</h2>
<p>Bounties enable users to attach money to a bug report. In most cases, that’s only a few dollars, but it doesn’t have to be you working on it. It can also motivate contributors to help you with the maintenance, which is cool too.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sponsorware</a> is a way to offer sponsors early-access to private repositories. When you reach a certain number of sponsors, you can open source the project and make it available to everyone.</p>
<p>It will help if you start new projects regularly and have an audience that can’t wait to test them.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>You can use your open source work as marketing for yourself and build up an audience. It takes time and doesn’t make you money from that alone, but it’s a chance to sell something additional. You probably know what your followers want, so it can be great to build something for them and make money with that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra work on top of your open source projects. You should consider this if you are very active on social media anyway.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>You are the expert for your software, so I’d want to learn more about your software. I prefer to get that educational content from you. Consider publishing an ebook or a video course that explains your software in all details and helps people use it.</p>
<h2 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>With an existing audience interested in your software, there is a good chance people are willing to pay you upfront to work on your project. It’s an excellent approach for something tangible, like a significant rewrite, a big shift in the development, or any other effort the community is willing to support.</p>
<h2 id="ads">Ads</h2>
<p>If you’ve got widespread documentation with thousands of page views every month, you’ll be able to put ads on it and earn money with that.</p>
<p>It’s not what we like to do because it’s little money to sell people’s privacy using your software. That said, some companies try to take an ethical approach to ads.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>If your software has a brand and people identify with it, a shop might work well for you. You can sell stickers, shirts, caps, posters, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Those products still cost you money, so you’ll only earn a part of what the customer pays for the product.</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>Maybe you have a software that can be the foundation for a whole ecosystem. Then you have the chance to add commercial products to the universe of your software.</p>
<p>People will buy your products because you’ll tailor them precisely for the software you built in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="paid-certifications">Paid certifications</h2>
<p>If companies are looking for developers with knowledge of your software, you can certify developers’ abilities. But if you already reached that level of popularity, you probably don’t need that post here anyway.</p>
<p>That said, we’ll hope that your open source project gains popularity and the list of things you can do somehow helps you make the maintenance and development sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s face it—nobody profits from abandoned open source projects.</p>
<p>That should give you a rough idea of what directions you could take.

Over the years, I explored quite a few ideas about neural search: from its core algorithms to the high-level system design, from a very academic-oriented prototype to a production-ready system. Readers can find those traces in my previous posts.<a id="more"></a> These exploration and lessons-learned are incredibly valuable as <strong>they make what Jina is today</strong>.</p><p>In this post, I collect the most featured soundbites from my earlier posts and group them into different categories. If you are new to neural search, or want to understand the design principle behind Jina, this curated list would be a perfect starting point.</p><div><p><strong>Jina</strong> is an easier way for enterprises and developers to build cross- &amp; multi-modal neural search systems on the cloud.

Problems such as adapting an algorithm from one domain to multiple domains; serving a model to billions of users; improving existing user experience with AI algorithms; piping a set of algorithms to automize the workflow; all of them belong to the one-to-N innovation.</li></ul><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2019/07/29/Generic-Neural-Elastic-Search-From-bert-as-service-and-Go-Way-Beyond/6d1778ad.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="forget-about-training">Forget about Training</span></h4><blockquote><p>Forget about training! It is not (economically) feasible anymore.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="the-new-ai-supply-chain">The New AI Supply-Chain</span></h4><blockquote><p>â€¦ the emerging AI supply-chain: only a very small number of people in the world will work on training new models from scratch, they deliver a â€œpretrained modelâ€� to the rest of the AI community. Most of AI engineers will then try to make sense of this pretrained model by adapting it to their applications, fine-tuning based on their data, incorporating domain knowledge to it and scaling it to serve millions of customers.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2019/07/29/Generic-Neural-Elastic-Search-From-bert-as-service-and-Go-Way-Beyond/3d69a409.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="the-three-layer-pyramid-of-ai-engineering">The Three-Layer Pyramid of AI Engineering</span></h4><blockquote><p>Letâ€™s look at the pyramid below which partitions the AI development landscape into three layers:</p><p>On the bottom, we have computing infrastructures, including CPU, GPU, FPGA, edge device, cloud computing, etc.</p><p>The middle layer is AI frameworks. For most of AI developers/engineers, frameworks are their primary interface to the low-level hardware.</p><p>Finally, the top layer is the vast end-to-end AI applications.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="having-a-b2d-mindset">Having a B2D Mindset</span></h4><blockquote><p>B2D is the shorthand for business to developer, as the products and services we are building are marketed to other developers. Having a B2D thoughtship means always keeping the developer experience in mind and thinking in switched positions.</p></blockquote><h4></h4><blockquote><p>The community often wants to get things done as quickly as possible. While the framework developers share the same ultimate goal, they have to take steps by first building lower layers steadily and robustly. When developing the framework as an open-source project, aligning the community expectation and being transparent on the roadmap is crucial.</p></blockquote><h2><span id="system-design">System Design</span></h2><h4><span id="what-is-symbolic-search-system">What is Symbolic Search System?</span></h4><blockquote><p>â€¦ at the core, Solr/Elasticsearch is a symbolic IR system that relies on the effective string representation of the query and product. â€¦</p><p>Formally, given a query $q\in \mathcal{Q}$ and a product $p\in\mathcal{P}$, one can think the NLP pipeline as a predefined function that maps from $\mathcal{Q}$ or $\mathcal{P}$ to a common string space $\mathcal{S}$, i.e. $f: \mathcal{Q}\mapsto \mathcal{S}$ or $g: \mathcal{P}\mapsto \mathcal{S}$, respectively. For the matching task, we just need a metric $m: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \mapsto [0, +\infty)$ and then evaluate $m\left(f(q),g(p)\right)$, â€¦</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2018/01/10/Build-Cross-Lingual-End-to-End-Product-Search-using-Tensorflow/399488d3.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="what-is-neural-ir-system">What is Neural IR System?</span></h4><blockquote><p>The next figure illustrates a neural information retrieval framework, which looks pretty much the same as its symbolic counterpart, except that the NLP pipeline is replaced by a deep neural network and the matching job is done in a learned common space. Now $f$ serves as a query encoder, $g$ serves as a product encoder.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2018/01/10/Build-Cross-Lingual-End-to-End-Product-Search-using-Tensorflow/dd4c4faa.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="symbolic-vs-neural-search-system">Symbolic vs. Neural Search System</span></h4><blockquote><p>Neural IR is a new concept emerging just recently. There are not so many off-the-shelf packages available. Plus, training a neural IR system requires quite some data. The next table summarizes the pros and cons of two systems.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Symbolic IR system</strong></th><th><strong>Neural IR system</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Efficient in query-time;<br>straightforward to implement;<br>results are interpretable;<br>many off-the-shelf packages.</td><td>Automatic;<br>resilient to noise;<br>scale-out easily;<br>requires little domain knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>Fragile;<br>Hard-coded knowledge;<br>high maintenance costs.</td><td>Less efficient in query-time;<br>hard to add business rules;<br>requires a lot of data.</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><blockquote><p>From the market perspective, there are two pain points of the current token/symbolic-based search:</p><ul><li>Increasing unsearchable content in enterprise IT &amp; consumer markets that are not handled by the token/symbolic-based search. This includes images, videos, animations, audios, 3D model renderings, and meta data.</li><li>Evolving needs have been shifted from count-based statistics to the cognitive/AI-driven insights, e.g. QA on enterprise wiki, media resources search, and meta-data intelligence.</li></ul></blockquote><h4><span id="reading-comprehension-in-search-system">Reading Comprehension in Search System</span></h4><blockquote><p>Having a search system with the reading comprehension ability can make the user experience smoother and more efficient, as all time-consuming tasks such as retrieving, inferring and summarizing are left to the computers. For impatient users who donâ€™t have time to read text carefully, such system can be very useful</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2018/04/21/Teach-Machine-to-Comprehend-Text-and-Answer-Question-with-Tensorflow/16ffb5e7.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="the-duality-in-question-answering-system">The Duality in Question Answering System</span></h4><blockquote><p>three modalities in the reading comprehension setting: question, answer and context. There are three modalities in the reading comprehension setting: question, answer and context. One can define two problems from different directions:</p><ul><li><strong>Question Answering</strong> (QA): infer an answer given a question and the context;</li><li><strong>Question Generation</strong> (QG): infer a question given an answer and the context.</li></ul><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2018/09/09/Dual-Ask-Answer-Network-for-Machine-Reading-Comprehension/d20488e5.png"></p><p>Careful readers may notice that there is some sort of cycle consistency between QA and QG: they are both defined as inferring one modality given the counterpart based on context.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="sequence-encoding-as-a-service">Sequence Encoding as a Service</span></h4><blockquote><p>So if many NLP applications rely on semantic features, then why donâ€™t we build a sentence encoding infrastructure that can serve multiple teams? This idea, despite how simple and straightforward, is not really practical until recently. Because many deep learning algorithms tailor the vector representation to a specific task or domain. Consequently, the representation from one application/team is not really reusable to other applications/teams. On contrary, BERT (as well as <a href="https://allennlp.org/elmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ELMo</a> and <a href="http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ULMFit</a>) decomposes an NLP task into <em>task-independent</em> pretraining and <em>task-specific</em> fine-tuning stages, where pretraining learns a model that is general enough and can be reused in many downstream tasks.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="bert-as-service-architecture">Bert-as-service Architecture</span></h4><blockquote><p>Decoupling also clarifies the C/S role. When the feature extraction becomes the bottleneck, then scale up the GPU server. When the downstream network is the bottleneck, then optimize the client by adding more CPU machines or doing quantization. When training data is too old or concept-drifted, then retrain the BERT and version-control the server, all downstream networks immediately enjoy the updated feature vectors. Finally, as all requests come to one place, your GPU server has less idle cycles and every penny is spent worthily.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2019/01/02/Serving-Google-BERT-in-Production-using-Tensorflow-and-ZeroMQ/d5ff2731.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="training-indexing-and-querying-in-a-neural-search-system">Training, Indexing, and Querying in a Neural Search System</span></h4><blockquote><p>The first concept Iâ€™d like to introduce is the <strong>runtime</strong>. In a typical search system, there are two fundamental tasks: <strong>indexing</strong> and <strong>querying</strong>. Indexing is storing the documents, querying is searching the documents on a given query, pretty straightforward. In a neural search system, one may also face another task: <strong>training</strong>, where one fine-tunes the model according to the data distribution to achieve better search relevance.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="jina-is-tensorflow-for-search">Jina is â€œTensorflowâ€� for Search</span></h4><blockquote><p>I often use the analogy <em>â€œTensorflowâ€� for search</em> to explain what Jina is. Jina sits one layer above the universal deep learning framework (e.g., Tensorflow, Pytorch, Mindspore); it provides the infrastructure for building AI-powered search applications. So the next time you develop a multi-/cross-modalities search app (question answering, image/video/audio search), Jina will be your go-to <em>â€œprogramming languageâ€�</em>. It helps you get the job done quickly and beautifully by providing you first-class support on AI models and rich cloud-native features.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/02/Layer-of-Abstraction-when-Building-Tensorflow-for-Search/e8b561b2.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="jina-is-not-an-one-liner">Jina is Not an One-Liner</span></h4><blockquote><p>Jina follows a progressive way when doing abstraction. Unlike one-liners, Jina is shipped with multiple layers of abstractions, each layer targets a particular developer group. As a consequence, users can choose different levels of API to interact with Jina and accomplish …</p></blockquote></div></div>

October 20, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy respecting" by the developers, or in general are considered to be so (mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation), while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing (using dns-prefetch or automatic updates etc.), using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust, or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they are perhaps a "one mans show" which cannot be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <strong>not</strong> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service etc. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point I'm trying to make is that the user needs to have the choice and that nothing happens until the user actively do something.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-clones">Third party clones</h2>
<p>Several third party clones of Firefox and Chromium exist that are branded and promoted as secure and privacy respecting alternatives that cannot fully be trusted for some reason or another. The code base for both Firefox and Chromium are huge and many skillful people work on the code every day. Having a "one mans show" or a small team of developers diverted browser clone running on your computer that are days, weeks or even months behind security updates does not improve neither your privacy nor your security in any way.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we need better insight into our opt-out rates for telemetry. We use telemetry to ensure new features improve your user experience and to guide Mozilla's business decisions. However, an unknown portion of our users do not report telemetry for a variety of reasons. This means we may not have data that is representative of our entire population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with good reason, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise they need to: Delete the DNS requests information, but at the same time somehow still keep "anonymized" logs of the total number of requests, a list of all domain names requested, a so-called "sample" of complete DNS queries along with date and time.</p>
<p>This means that even if Cloudflare could be trusted and they have the best of intentions, they will still log everything the first 24 hours. If Cloudflare is ever compromised all these logs could be copied and distributed over a period of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the actual wording of the …</p></article></div>

    <p>The compact disc—the CD—was co-developed by Philips and Sony back in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:updates-cd"><a href="#fn:updates-cd" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This format was initially developed to store and play music but was then adapted to what we know as the CD-ROM to store data as well, and other formats followed that allowed us to read and write different kinds of data.</p>
<p>In 1995, Microsoft shipped Windows 95 as a CD-ROM and also as a pack of 13 or 26 floppy disks for compatibility with older computers that didn't have a compact disc reader. The entire Windows 95 operating system was only around 22 to 24 megabytes. (More than four times smaller than Instagram for iPhone!)</p>
<p>Priced at dozens or hundreds of dollars, software used to come packed in a huge box. The lucky software, the one that could afford the development costs, would update every couple of years. Windows 95, for instance, released a few updates and patches in 1996 and 1997, while Windows 98 was cooking.</p>
<p>The transaction happened at a physical store where we were buying something tangible: a program packed in a box.</p>
<p>The Office Suite—Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—was bought in a box and installed in your machine with a CD. Every time you formatted your computer or bought a new one, you would come back to those CDs and re-install the software. Office 2003. 2009. 2013. These updates demarcated the appearance of file formats and new functionality that wouldn't work in older versions.</p>
<p>Today you buy a phone with a set of preinstalled apps and, right at your fingertips, you have an app store. With a payment method, you can make a transaction with a finger tap, your fingerprint, or a scan of your face. The app starts installing right away. Maybe free, maybe a couple of dollars. This world is cheaper but gets more and more expensive as we transition into a subscription model. And stores are not only on your phone but on your tablet, laptop, browser, and even on your photo camera or game console.</p>
<p>We get notified of new versions of the apps we use daily. And there's a culture of constant improvement in which applications like Dropbox, Spotify, or Uber release a new version weekly or bi-weekly to keep up-to-date.</p>
<p>At any stage, software bugs can be introduced, existing ones fixed, and new functionality added. We used to have a program that would continue to work the same way for years. But we now have what's called <em>liquid software</em>. Ever-changing code and hundreds of version numbers. (Dropbox is up to version 107.4.443 as I write these lines!)</p>
<p>We're in an era of constant updates, and there's no way back. If there's a bug today, we expect a fix tomorrow. A patch, an update. The problem comes when we can't say no and need to keep programs up-to-date to run on the latest operating systems that would otherwise stop functioning.</p>
<p>Software rots.</p>
<p>In the mobile world, there's a chance that you never upgrade and use a fixed set of functionality. But the web is different. When you load a website, it might have been re-deployed. A new version, updated seconds ago, runs in your browser. The red button you used yesterday to send an email might have changed its place, color, or shape overnight. A piece of functionality you liked (or the annoying bug you had yesterday) might suddenly go away.</p>
<p>An alternative might be to use custom systems or systems with slower update cycles in which backward compatibility is a priority.</p>
<p>Yet it's unlikely we'll ever go back to the once-a-year update, the diskette, or the CD.</p>

    <p>Gui­de for Emer­gen­cy Pre­pa­red­ness and Cor­rect Ac­ti­on in Emer­gen­cy Si­tua­ti­ons</p>


<p>What can you do for your sa­fe­ty in the event of a di­sas­ter?</p>

<p>In spring 2013, af­ter weeks of rain, who­le are­as of southern, eas­tern and nor­thern Ger­ma­ny we­re be­set by ca­ta­stro­phic floods. Sett­le­ments va­nis­hed in the floods up to the roofs of the hou­ses, tens of thou­sands of emer­gen­cy per­son­nel and vol­un­teers strug­gled against the wa­ter with sand­bags. Vil­la­ges and parts of towns had to be eva­cua­ted, and the ci­ti­zens we­re on­ly ab­le to ta­ke the es­sen­ti­als with them.</p>

<p>Di­sas­ters are part of li­fe. Al­most eve­ry day, we can read about di­sas­ters and lar­ges­ca­le emer­gen­cies in a va­rie­ty of me­dia and see the images of de­struc­ti­on and suf­fe­ring. The­se are not just ma­jor di­sas­ters which af­fect lar­ge are­as for a long ti­me. Lo­cal tor­ren­ti­al rain, a se­ve­re storm, an elec­tric power break­down re­sul­ting from such a storm, or a hou­se fi­re can trig­ger a ve­ry per­so­nal di­sas­ter for each in­di­vi­du­al, each fa­mi­ly, which has to be over­co­me. Ta­ke the ti­me to con­tem­pla­te your per­so­nal emer­gen­cy plan­ning.</p>

<p>This bro­chu­re aims to help you to de­ve­lop your per­so­nal pre­pa­red­ness plan.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>While HTTP/3 specification is still in the draft stage, the latest version of the Chrome browser already <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">supports it by default</a>
. With Chrome holding around 70% of browser market share, you could say HTTP/3 has gone mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/quic-logo.png" alt="QUIC logo"></p><p>The new revision of this foundational protocol aims to make the web more efficient, secure, and shorten the content-delivery latencies. In some ways, it’s a braver take of HTTP2: similar goals addressed by replacing the underlying TCP protocol with a new, purpose-built protocol QUIC. The best way to explain the benefits of QUIC is to illustrate where TCP falls short as a transport for HTTP requests. And to do that, we’ll start at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="http-the-original">HTTP. The Original.</h3><p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee formalized the design of a simple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line hyper-text-exchange protocol</a>
in 1991, TCP was already an old, reliable protocol. The original definition document of what later became known as HTTP 0.9 specifically mentions TCP as a preferred, albeit not exclusive, transport protocol:</p><blockquote><p>Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented service.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this proof-of-concept version of HTTP had very few similarities to HTTP we now know and love today. There were no headers and no status codes. The typical request was as simple as <code>GET /path</code>. The response contained only HTML and ended with the closing of the TCP connection.
Since browsers were not yet a thing, user was supposed to read HTML directly. It was possible to link to other resources, but none of the tags present in this early version of HTML requested additional resources asynchronously. A single HTTP request delivered a complete, self-sufficient page.</p><h3 id="emergence-of-http10">Emergence of HTTP/1.0</h3><p>In subsequent years the internet has exploded, and HTTP evolved to be an extendable and flexible general-purpose protocol, although transporting HTML remained its chief specialty. There are three critical updates to HTTP that enabled this evolution:</p><ul><li>introduction of methods allowed the client to identify the type of action it wants to perform. For example, POST was created to allow client sending data to the server to process and store</li><li>status codes provided a way for client to confirm that the server has processed the request successfully, and if not - to understand what kind of error has occured</li><li>headers added an ability to attach structured textual metadata to requests and responses that could modify the behavior of the client or server. Encoding and content-type headers, for example, allowed HTTP to transfer not just HTML, but any type of payload. “Compression” header allowed the client and server to negotiate supported compression formats, thus reducing the amount of data to transfer over the connection</li></ul><p>At the same time, HTML advanced to support images, styles, and other linked resources. Browsers were now forced to perfrom multiple requests to display a single web page, which the original connection-per-request architecture was not designed to handle. Establishing and ending a TCP connection involves a lot of back-and-forth packet exchange, so it is relatively expensive in terms of latency overhead. It didn’t matter much when a web-page consisted of a single text file, but as the number of requests per page increased, so did the latency.</p><p>The picture below illustrates how much overhead was involved in establishing a new TCP connection per request.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-tcp-overhead.png" alt="TCP connection requires three requests to establish connection and four to close it cleanly"></p><p>A “connection” header was created to address this problem. Client sends a request with “connection: keep-alive” header to signal intent to keep the TCP connection open for subsequent requests. If server understands this header and agrees to respect it, its response will also contain the “connection: keep-alive” header. This way, both parties maintain TCP channel open and use it for subsequent communication until either party decides to close it. This became even more important with the spread of SSL/TLS encryption, because negotianting an encryption algorithm and exchanging cryptographic keys requires an additional request/response cycle on each connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-keepalive.png" alt="A single TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests with “connection: keep-alive” header"></p><p>At the time, many of the HTTP improvements appeared spontaneously. When a popular browser or a server app saw a need for a new HTTP feature, they would simply implement it themselves and hoped that other parties would follow the suit. Ironically, a decentralized web needed a centralized governing body to avoid fragmentation into incompatible pieces. Tim Berners-Lee, the original creator of the protocol, recognized the danger and founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which together with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) worked on formalizing stack of internet technologies. As the initial step to bring more structure to the existing environment, they documented the most common features used in HTTP at the time and named the resulting protocol HTTP/1.0. However, because this “specification” described varied, often inconsistent techniques as seen “in the wild”, it never received a status of a standard. Instead, the work on the new version of the HTTP protocol has begun.</p><h3 id="standardization-of-http11">Standardization of HTTP/1.1</h3><p>HTTP/1.1 fixed inconsistencies of HTTP/1.0 and adjusted the protocol to be more performant in the new web ecosystem. Two of the most critical changes introduced were the use of persistent TCP connections (keep-alive’s) by default and HTTP pipelining.</p><p>HTTP pipelining simply means that client does not need to wait for the server to respond to a request before sending subsequent HTTP requests. This feature resulted in even more efficient use of bandwidth and reduced latencies, but it could be improved even more. HTTP pipelining still requires from server to respond in the order of requests received, so if a single request in a pipeline is slow to fulfill, all subsequent responses to a client will be delayed accordingly. This problem is known as head-of-the-line blocking.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http11-blocking.png" alt="Since large-picture.jpg was requested first, it’s blocking the delivery of the style.css"></p><p>At this point in time, the web is gaining more and more interactive capabilities. Web 2.0 is just around the corner, some webpages include dozens or even hundreds of external resources. To work around the head-of-the-line blocking, and to decrease page loading speeds, clients establish multiple TCP connections per host. Of course, the connection overhead never went anywhere. In reality, it got worse, since more and more applications encrypt HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS. So most browsers set the limit of maximal possible simultaneous connections in an attempt to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>Many of the larger web-services have recognized that existing limitations are too restricting for their exceptionally heavy interactive web-applications, so they “gamed the system” by distributing their app through multiple domain names. It all worked, somehow, but the solution has been far from elegant.</p><p>Despite a few shortcomings, the simplicity of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 has made them widely successful, and for over a decade no one has made a serious attempt to change them.</p><h3 id="spdy-and-http2">SPDY and HTTP/2</h3><p>In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser, which rapidly gained popularity for being quick and innovative. It has given Google a strong vote on matters of internet technologies. In the early 2010s, Google adds support for its web protocol SPDY to Chrome.</p><p>HTTP/2 standard was based on SPDY with some improvements. HTTP/2 solved the head-of-the-line blocking problem by multiplexing the HTTP requests over a single open TCP connection. This allowed server to answer requests in any order, client could then re-assemble the responses as it received them, making the whole exchange faster within a single connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http2-multiplexing.png" alt="style.css was returned before the large-picture.jpg, becuase of HTTP/2 multiplexing"></p><p>In fact, with HTTP/2 server can serve the resources to a client before it even asked for it! To give an example, if the server knows that client will most likely need a stylesheet to display an HTML page, it can “push” the CSS to the client without waiting for a corresponding request. While beneficial in theory, this feature rarely seen in practice, since it requires a server to understand the structure of the HTML it serves, which is rarely the case.</p><p>HTTP/2 also allows compressing request headers in addition to the request body, which further reduces the amount of data transferred over the wire.</p><p>HTTP/2 solved a lot of problems for the web, but not all of them. A similar type of head-of-the-line problem is still present on the level of TCP protocol, which remains a foundational building block of the web. When a TCP packet gets lost in transit, the receiver can’t acknowledge incoming packages until the lost package is re-sent by a server. Since TCP is by design oblivious to higher-level protocols like HTTP, a single lost packet will block the stream for all in-flight HTTP requests until the missing data is re-sent. This problem is especially prominent on an unreliable connection, which is not rare in the age of ubiquitous mobile devices.</p><h3 id="http3-revolution">HTTP/3 revolution</h3><p>Since issues with HTTP/2 can not be resolved purely on the application layer a new iteration of the protocol must update the transport layer. However, creating a new transport-layer protocol is not an easy task. Transport protocols need to be supported by hardware vendors and deployed by the majority of network operators, which are reluctant to update because of the costs and efforts involved. Take IPv6 as an example: it was introduced 24 years ago and is still far from being universally supported.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another option. UDP protocol is as widely supported as TCP but is simple enough to serve as a building block for custom protocols running on top of it. UDP packets are fire-and-forget: there are no handshakes, persistent connections, or error-correction. The primary idea behind HTTP3 is to abandon TCP in favor of a UDP-based QUIC protocol. QUIC adds the necessary features (those that were previously provided by TCP, and more) in a way that makes sense for the web environment.</p><p>Unlike HTTP2, which technically allowed an unencrypted communication, QUIC strictly requires encryption to establish a connection. Additionally, encryption is applied to all data …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<h2><span>Adolphe Sax, a Dinantais of genius</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with Joachim Patenier (1485-1524), the creator of landscape painting; with Antoine Wiertz (1806-1865), the lyrical painter; with a plethora of sculptors, painters, musicians, brassworkers and others, Dinant can legitimately pride itself on having been the birthplace on 6 November 1814 of Antoine-Joseph, or Adolphe, Sax, a prolific and inspired inventor in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>In 1860, the diarist, Oscar Comettant, wrote, "In the services that he has rendered to musical art, in the battles he has had to go through to bring his discoveries to the light of day and defend them from despoilment and in the rewards he has been the object of from all the industrial nations, [Sax's life] rises to the heights of a social event. Novelists will draw from this strange life mysterious and moving episodes (we would add: the legal world will find in the account of the "Sax trial" a vast domain for a case law study) and the moralists will find in it the features of self-denial, physical courage and perseverance, of which only a lifted soul and a great heart are capable.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Enfance"></a>
<h2><span>An Agitated Childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Antoine-Joseph Sax was born in the street that has borne his name since 1896, in a modest house, which was destroyed in 1914, and which was built on the present site of an important commercial building.</p>
<p>In its façade, there is a stained-glass window and an inscription chiselled into the stonework: "Adolphe Sax, 1814-1894, was born here". This window was solemnly inaugurated on 27 June 1954, on the initiative of the Tourist Information Centre, under the mayorship of Mr Léon Sasserath. It is the work of Mr Jean Jadin, who designed the cartoon, and Miss Maggy Arzée. Both were taught by Miss Yvonne Gérard and Mr Perot, teachers of graphic art and decoration at the Fine Arts Academy in Namur, which was then directed by Mr Lambeau. It was created under the direction of Mr Van de Capelle.</p>
<p>Son of Charles-Joseph Sax (1791-1865) and Marie-Joseph Masson (1813-1861), Antoine-Joseph was the eldest of eleven children (six boys and five girls, only four of whom survived, the others dying between the ages of 20 and 25).</p>
<p>His childhood was tragic. Hardly able to stand, Antoine-Joseph fell from a height of three floors, seriously bumping his head against a stone: he was believed dead. At the age of three, he swallowed a bowl of vitriolized water, and then a pin. Later, he was seriously burned in a gunpowder explosion; he fell onto a cast iron frying pan and burned himself on one side. Three times he escaped poisoning and asphyxiation in his bedroom, where varnished items were lying about during the night. Another time, he was hit on the head by a cobblestone; he fell into a river and was saved by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>"<em>He's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live," his mother said. In the district, they called him "little Sax, the ghost</em>".</p>
<p>These initial serious incidents were, alas, but the prelude to an eventful existence such as only a few have known. In 1858, Adolphe Sax was miraculously saved from a cancer of the lip by a black doctor who knew the properties of certain Indian plants. What would the future have been but for this intervention?</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Charles-Joseph"></a>
<h2><span>Charles-Joseph Sax</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A joiner-cabinetmaker, Charles-Joseph Sax quickly launched himself, with success, into the manufacture of musical instruments. In the "New Street" he ran a large workshop. In this trade, he acquired such a reputation that, in 1815 (his eldest son was only one year old), he also set up a workshop in Brussels (where Antoine-Joseph's brothers and sisters were to be born), where he was summoned by William I of Orange (we were then under Dutch occupation). The latter appointed him as maker to the Court and entrusted him with the task of supplying suitable instruments to Belgium regimental music corps.</p>
<p>A self-taught man, therefore, Charles-Joseph Sax made woodwind and brass instruments, even violins and pianos. He registered a dozen patents and brought his instruments to perfection. He successfully participated in numerous exhibitions, where he was awarded flattering distinctions.</p>
<p>At the time when he could have spend the day playing, laughing and having fun, Antoine-Joseph observed the work in his father's workshop, besides being given instruction by one of his uncles, a teacher in Dinant. He was intelligent and his inventive mind was already showing itself, thanks to his love for music (whilst very young, he took singing and flute lessons). Thereafter, he was given lessons by his father, who quickly appreciated his abilities and did all he could to develop them.</p>
<p>Far from disregarding his son's aspirations, Charles-Joseph Sax made him his apprentice and, from a young age, he was conscious of the importance of his work, as though he were anticipating his destiny.</p>
<p>In 1853, after the death of seven of his eleven children, and following financial worries at his Brussels business, Charles-Joseph joined his son in Paris. The master was to become the servant, and was from then on in charge of making saxophones until his death in 1865.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Jeunesse"></a>
<h2><span>A productive childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Supported and assisted by his father, the youth worked. He created, he perfected instruments and he played them. He was 16 when he went to the Industrial Exposition in Brussels to present flutes and ivory clarinets. At the age of 20, he made an entirely new clarinet, with 24 keys, a work of imagination and a masterpiece of manual work. Then, a new bass clarinet, which incited enthusiasm in Habeneck, the leader of the orchestra at the Paris Opera House, who was passing through Brussels, and who called the other clarinets "barbarian instruments".</p>
<p>Even at that early stage, this creation provoked jealousy in the soloist at the "Great Royal Harmony" in Brussels, who refused to use it because, he said, it had come from "that weedy little pupil, Sax". "Play your clarinet, then" Sax answered, " and I shall play mine." The challenge accepted, Sax triumphed in front of four thousand people. He became a soloist. Works were written for him that, after his departure, were no longer played because they were so difficult!</p>
<p>The young genius pursued his work. He invented a sound reflector, a new double-bass clarinet, a piano-tuning process that remained the inventor's secret and who probably was unable to exploit it for want of money, a steam organ "capable of being heard throughout the province": now that just shows Sax's tendency to think big!</p>
<p>Sax's beginnings throw a very curious light on his character (we shall call him Adolphe from now on): energy, courage, dynamism, total self-confidence. He refused to go and set up a business in St Petersburg, rejected an offer to set up in London. That means that his reputation exceeded frontiers. Sax was conscious of all his possibilities and his talent; he conceived the work that he felt the call to achieve; he was full of hope and he believed he had every chance of success; he had great visions, he believed in what he saw. He suffocated in his little country.</p>
<p>In 1840, he presented nine inventions at the Belgian Exhibition. He was denied the first medal on the plea of his young age; there would be nothing left to offer him the year after. He was thwarted in his true-love, if not in his pride. He refused the vermeil medal he was awarded, replying with pride, "<em>If they think me too young to deserve the gold medal, I myself think me too old to accept this vermeil one</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<h2><span>The Call to Paris</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe's centre of attraction, Paris haunted him, Paris called him.</p>
<p>The composer Halévy wrote to him of the hope that composers had in his inventions: "<em>Hurry and finish your new family of instruments (saxophones) and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.</em>"</p>
<p>Let us add to this call and the snub in Brussels the fact of his family trials, and the decision was made: Adolphe Sax left for Paris "rich in ideas and light in cash": he had thirty francs in his pocket!</p>
<p>The year 1842 formed the turning point in Sax's life, possessing as he did his new invention: the saxophone and its family.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dinant.be/uploads/pages/286/sax_atel.jpg" alt="">Moreover, in 1841, had he not presented it anonymously in Brussels, behind a curtain, so as not to disclose it and avoid the risk of plagiarism?</p>
<p>Adolphe Sax was almost thirty, "the age at which man's creative character affirms itself, at which the human personality is drawn." At the age of 27, Napoleon won his first battle in Italy; Newton was 24 and Einstein 26 when they devised their theories. Mozart died aged 35 and Schubert at 31. Examples of precocious geniuses are manifold.</p>
<p>As one former inhabitant of Dinant once rightfully said (1) "<em>a distinction has to be drawn here between a man who draws from his own abstract thoughts the stuff that his genius will knead, him for whom symbols and signs are sufficient to bring forth a thought laden with restrained life and latent splendours; and the other man for whom a technique, slow and tenacious apprenticeship on a complicated apparatus is necessary for him to be able to physically achieve the formal idea. Count, for example, how many early-developing mathematicians there are compared with child physicists. The former exist, the latter are nowhere to be found. Sax is of the category of intellectuals that concentrated on matter and not pure form"</em>.</p>
<p>In 1842, there was Adolphe Sax living in a simple shed in Rue Saint-Georges, Paris. To set up business, he had to borrow money from a musician acquaintance.</p>

</blockquote>
<a name="Berlioz"></a>
<h2><span>Thanks to Berlioz</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><span><strong>About the saxophone, he said "<em>Its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck; there does not exist another musical instrument …</em></strong></span></p></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<audio controls="controls"><source src="https://azumbrunnen.me/audio/chatbot-is-dead" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>



<p>Personal websites are usually like old books in a shelf. They languish, accumulate dust, and their wrinkles and cracks become more apparent over time. About 3 years ago I embarked on a simple experiment that would end up prolonging the shelf-life of my website by an unusually large margin.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, it seemed like Conversational UI was poised to take over the world. We saw Quartz turning news into a conversation, WeChat being featured as the poster-child of a post application world, iMessage turning into an unnecessarily complex mess, and chatbots popping up like mushrooms in moist forests.</p>



<p>Of course, any trend gaining so much traction and interest needs to be taken seriously. As such, I decided to familiarize myself with the topic, and turned my website into a chatbot.</p>



<p>Instead of being greeted by the internationally standardized greeting every designer used at some point in their career, there was no bold, dramatically oversized, and deep black sans-serif reading: <em>Hi, I’m a designer.</em> (To be fair, I didn’t use Proxima Nova either)</p>



<p>Instead, a couple of chat bubbles exuberantly ushered onto the canvas to greet users as if we had all been long time friends.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-animated.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Conversational intro</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was witty, new, and slightly awkward. People would send messages that ranged from simple chit chat, to deep philosophical topics, to downright disturbing and ridiculous insults.</p>



<p>The experiment got featured on Hackernews, Medium, was used in psychological studies conducted by Dan Ariely’s team, and the source code was ripped and edited by various startups to fit their needs. One business in the Bay Area had an idea to use it to sell flowers in a conversational way. It looks like they went out of business.</p>



<p>The reaction and feedback was surprising to say the least. It was an idea so simple, so silly, that the outcome was in many ways unexpected. After all, the only one who really cares about your website, is usually yourself.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop me from revamping my website and kill the very thing that had turned it into a micro-celebrity before. With the death of my old chatbot, some angry emails by schools who are using it as a reference for “creative” web design, and a good amount of time that has passed ever since, I wanted to take a step back and set the record straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2>When chatbots matter</h2>



<p>So let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: <em>when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot?</em> And I’m not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you’re bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.</p>



<p>I love you Intercom, except when I don’t. 99% of time I don’t want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what’s going on. Somehow, I can’t help but think others feel the same.</p>



<p>In fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.</p>



<p>To further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot’s don’t just become awkward and unpredictable—they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png" alt="" srcset="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png 400w, https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>UX Chat.me —&nbsp;Conversational UX News</figcaption></figure>



<p>The moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with <em>your brand</em>. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity—a symbol—that represents everything you and your team stand for. That’s not a step to be taken lightly.</p>



<p>This simple conversational entity can be a fun tool to engage with people but depending on how the conversation goes, it can quickly turn into a misrepresentation of the values of your team and your company. So building a chat bot should never be the default choice, but an intentional one.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth asking yourself the following three questions before venturing into this space:</p>



<h3>1. Is your use case simple enough to be solved through chat?</h3>



<p>Conversation is incredibly complex and it’s challenging enough to keep it on track in the real world. If the use case isn’t simple, chances are, chat bots are not the right tool for the job.</p>



<h3>2. Is your NLP capable and sophisticated enough?</h3>



<p>There are two types of bots: pre-scripted bots with a range of default answers users can choose from, and Natural Language Processing based ones.</p>



<p>Choosing the right one is hard. While pre-scripted can feel too limiting, NLP can break at every corner. Often times, teams quickly fall into the trap of spending a huge amount of time focusing on personality and silly jokes, instead of solving the problem users hired you for in the first place.</p>



<p>Therefore, building on top of the first point above, within the conversational landscape, simple always wins.</p>



<h3>3. Are your users actually in chat based environments?</h3>



<p>Chat bots work best where users already are. If your users are primarily spending time in messaging platforms where bots and micro-apps can be seamlessly embedded, great. That can serve as an effective and natural way to engage with your audience because it matches the “be where users already are” principle.</p>



<p>If on the other hand, people come to your website, a medium that has made great strides to provide content in a non-linear and quick way, it often unnecessarily slows users down. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Farewell chatbot</h2>



<p>I don’t want to discredit chat bots as a paradigm. They have their use in certain industries, medium, and work well for a specific set of use cases. The important part is being deliberate, rather than jumping ship blindfolded.</p>



<p>So whereas turning my website into a chat was a fun experiment, I ultimately feel like it has slowly turned into a fad. I got fooled by the trend, and as a by-product became part of the trend itself.  Fads come and go, and as they get refined and re-interpreted, they ultimately find their true purpose. What we’re left with is the age old insight that it’s only through experimentation, that we can unlock concepts and ideas that last.</p>



<p>Rest in peace chat bot, long live chat bots.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A survey conducted by u/PM_ME__UR_CANCER</p>
        <p><img src="https://747anon.github.io/blm-survey/img/github.png" width="200px" alt="Github"></p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.
            </p></div>

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said

                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

                The above holds true when compared to the correlation between countries, and it becomes clear that countries with a

<p><strong>In the first of the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to DRM” series, we define</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>what DRM (Digital Rights Management) is,</strong></li><li><strong>and why it plays an important role in ensuring fair use of digital resources through a combination of encryption, access control technology, and business rules.</strong></li></ul>








<h2><span id="The_Tale_of_Two_Boys"></span>The Tale of Two Boys<span></span></h2>



<p>Ram and Shyam were 7th graders who loved passing notes to each other during class. An inseparable duo, their notes contained the latest school gossip, computer game cheat codes, and cricket match scores.</p>



<p>Their notes used to pass through several of their classmates’ hands in their journey because they sat far away from each other in class. But, the boys weren’t worried about others learning their secrets because they trusted their classmates.</p>



<p>However, one sad day, one of their classmates opened one of their notes and broke their trust!! Delighted by the juicy gossip in the note, he used it to take Ram and Shyam’s lunch money.</p>

<p>Having lost all of his lunch money, Ram thought long and hard about sending his notes securely to Shyam and before long, Ram had an idea.</p>



<p>“How about using a code language to write my notes?”</p>



<p>Excellent idea, he thought to himself and set about creating a substitution code (1 for A, 2 for B, and so on). The following day in class, Ram used his new code language to write a secret message and send it to Shyam.</p>



<p>The note made its way to Shyam through the hands of several curious (&amp; nosy) classmates, and none of them could crack the code.</p>



<p>But, when Shyam got the message, he looked perplexed and thought to himself –</p>



<blockquote><p>What are these numbers, squiggly lines, and alphabets? Is Ram testing his new pen, or was he hit on the head with a cricket ball?</p></blockquote>



<p>Ram stared at Shyam’s puzzled face with equal bewilderment and suddenly realized his mistake. He had forgotten to send Shyam the key to the code!</p>



<p>So, Ram wrote down the code on a piece of paper and sent it to Shyam, who used it to decode the note.</p>



<p>Job well done, Ram thought to himself.</p>



<p>They didn’t know that one of their classmates had copied down the coded message and now had the codebook. For the second day in a row, Ram and Shyam lost their secrets and their lunch money.</p>



<p>They realized that they needed to transmit the code securely each time they used code or changed it.</p>



<p><strong>But how would they do that?</strong></p>



<h2 id="what-did-ram--shyam-do"><span id="What_Did_Ram_Shyam_Do"></span>What Did Ram &amp; Shyam Do?<span></span></h2>



<p><strong><em>Narrator:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The problem faced by the boys is a classic problem in data transmission. It is easy to use a codebook, create a secret message, and send it to the recipient but, how do you send the codebook to the recipient and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?</em></p>



<p>Then one night, Shyam had a brainwave. He called Ram and said –</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – suppose we ask Hari to join us in note passing? We’ll ask him to keep the codebook safe in his schoolbag. Each time you or I need to write or read a message, we’ll ask Hari for the codebook. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – that could work! But, will Hari agree to this?</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Yea – I thought of that too. Every time we ask him for the codebook, let’s give him a chocolate.</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Ah – excellent idea!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;So, the boys decided to bring in their friend Hari into their plans and asked him to be a “trusted” third-party. And, his duties were to –</p>



<ol><li>invent a new code every day to reduce chances of someone cracking it and</li><li>provide the code’s key to only Ram and Shyam in a way that nobody else can open and read it.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And the boys had to give him a bar of chocolate each time they asked for the codebook.</strong></p>



<p>Yummy price to pay for privacy, huh?</p>



<h2 id="digital-rights-management-drm"><span id="Digital_Rights_Management_(DRM)"></span>Digital Rights Management (DRM)<span></span></h2>



<p>In reality, what our creative 7th graders invented was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that not only provided security for their content (notes) but also allowed them to set some rules.</p>



<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method of protecting your content while having the flexibility to chose who gets to consume it via business rules and a secure, protected communication protocol.</p>



<p>For example, you could set rules to,</p>



<ul><li>block people from certain countries,</li><li>allow access to the content for a certain period,</li><li>prevent a user from casting the movie onto a screen,</li><li>block free users from accessing premium content,</li><li>block playback on specific devices,</li><li>etc.</li></ul>



<p>DRM plays a vital role in reducing piracy and ensuring that content creators can monetize their efforts.</p>



<p>But, remember this –&nbsp;<strong>DRM is not the same as encryption</strong>.</p>



<p>DRM is a system or solution that</p>



<ul><li>uses encryption to protect the content</li><li>uses specialized techniques to <strong>securely store and deliver</strong> the encryption/decryption keys&nbsp;<em>(codebooks in our 7th graders’ example)</em> and use the keys to decrypt the content in a way that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. </li><li>allows the content publishers to set business rules and control who can consume their content (expiry times, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>We’ll learn more about this in future articles.</p>



<h2 id="back-to-our-7th-graders"><span id="Back_to_Our_7th_Graders"></span>Back to Our 7th Graders<span></span></h2>



<p>Now let’s go back and look at the simple solution that our 7th graders invented, which provided</p>



<ul><li>a high-security level through daily renewal and code rotation.</li><li>authentication and rights management (read, write permissions)</li><li>a well-defined pricing model.</li></ul>



<p>The truly remarkable part about this scheme is that as Ram and Shyam get more popular in school, they can allow a few other classmates to only “read” their messages and not “write” any messages.</p>



<p>All they’d need to do is go to Hari, give him the names and photos of their “newly trusted” friends, and ask Hari to allow them only to read the messages.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;the boys’ messages get super-popular, they can ask Hari to</p>



<ul><li>block or allow access to classmates based on where they sit in class:&nbsp;<em>front-benchers not allowed</em>&nbsp;<strong>(geo-blocking)</strong></li><li>Create a set of special notes and charge their classmates two chocolates to read them. All they need to do is tell Hari their subscribers’ names.&nbsp;<strong>(paid usage / subscribers / freemium model)</strong></li><li>deny access to messages that are more than 2 hours old (stale news!)&nbsp;<strong>(expiry date &amp; time of day restriction)</strong></li></ul>



<p>And so on. Amazing, right?</p>



<p>A simple technique to prevent others from reading their messages has now turned into a full-blown business with</p>



<ul><li>heavy-duty encryption and</li><li>business rules that decide access and usage rights.</li></ul>



<h2 id="commercial-drm-solutions"><span id="Commercial_DRM_Solutions"></span>Commercial DRM Solutions<span></span></h2>



<p>Commercially, there are many trusted DRM technologies such as Microsoft’s PlayReady, Google’s Widevine, and Apple’s FairPlay. And there are DRM vendors who provide additional infrastructure around these DRM solutions by adding more business rules, analytics, and tools for publishers.</p>



<p>In future articles, we’ll examine the differences between them and see where they are applicable.</p>



<p>Until then, take care, and see you soon!</p>



<p><strong>Note: DRM is seen as a contentious topic with people on both sides of the fence. This series of articles is a technology-explainer and stays clear of the other debates on DRM.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <p>Today at <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/egsr18/">EGSR 2018</a>, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced the release of two large, production quality/scale data sets for rendering research purposes.
The data sets are available on a new <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/data-sets/">data sets page on the official Disney Animation website</a>.
The first data set is the Cloud Data Set, which contains a large and highly detailed volumetric cloud data set that we used for our “<a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2017/07/spectral-and-decomposition-tracking.html">Spectral and Decomposition Tracking for Rendering Heterogeneous Volumes</a>” SIGGRAPH 2017 paper, and the second data set is the Moana Island Scene, which is a full production scene from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2016/11/moana.html">Moana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/shotCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/shotCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 1: The Moana Island Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share some personal thoughts, observations, and notes.
The release of these data sets was announced by my teammate, Ralf Habel, at EGSR today, but this release has been in the works for a very long time now, and is the product of the collective effort of an enormous number of people across the studio.
A number of people deserve to be highlighted: Rasmus Tamstorf spearheaded the entire effort and was instrumental in getting the resources and legal approval needed for the Moana Island Scene.
Heather Pritchett is the TD that did the actual difficult work of extracting the Moana Island Scene out of Disney Animation’s production pipeline and converting it from proprietary data formats into usable, industry-standard data formats.
Sean Palmer and Jonathan Garcia also helped in resurrecting the data from Moana.
Hyperion developers Ralf Habel and Peter Kutz led the effort to get the Cloud Data Set approved and released; the cloud itself was made by artists Henrik Falt and Alex Nijmeh.
On the management side of things, technology manager Rajesh Sharma and Disney Animation CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ncannon?lang=en">Nick Cannon</a>, provided crucial support and encouragement.
Matt Pharr has been crucial in collaborating with us to get these data sets released.
Matt was highly accommodating in helping us get the Moana Island Scene into a PBRT scene; I’ll talk a bit more about this later.
Intel’s Embree team also gave significant feedback.
My role was actually quite small; along with other members of the Hyperion development team, I just provided some consultation throughout the whole process.</p>

<p>Please note the licenses that the data sets come with.
The Cloud Data Set is licensed under a <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/6/asset/License_Cloud.pdf">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>; the actual cloud is based on a photograph by Kevin Udy on his <a href="https://coclouds.com/436/cumulus/%202012-07-26/">Colorado Clouds Blog</a>, which is also licensed under the same Creative Commons license.
The Moana Island Scene is licensed under a more restrictive, custom Disney Enterprises <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/4/asset/License_Moana.pdf">research license</a>.
This is because the Moana Island Scene is a true production scene; it was actually used to produce actual frames in the final film.
As such, the data set is being released only for pure research and development purposes; it’s not meant for use in artistic projects.
Please stick to and follow the licenses these data sets are released under; if people end up misusing these data sets, then it makes releasing more data sets into the community in the future much harder for us.</p>

<p>This entire effort was sparked two years ago at SIGGRAPH 2016, when Matt Pharr made an appeal to the industry to provide representative production-scale data sets to the research community.
I don’t know how many times I’ve had conversations about how well new techniques or papers or technologies will scale to production cases, only to have further discussion stymied by the lack of any true production data sets that the research community can test against.
We decided as a studio to answer Matt’s appeal, and last year at SIGGRAPH 2017, Brent Burley and Rasmus Tamstorf announced our intention to release both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets.
It’s taken nearly a year from announcement to release because the process has been complex, and it was very important to the studio to make sure the release was done properly.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges was getting all of the data out of the production pipeline and our various proprietary data formats into something that the research community can actually parse and make use of.
Matt Pharr was extremely helpful here; over the past year, Matt has added support for <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a> textures and implemented the <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/burley/s2015_pbs_disney_bsdf_notes.pdf">Disney Bsdf</a> in <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">PBRT v3</a>.
Having Ptex and the Disney Bsdf available in PBRT v3 made PBRT v3 the natural target for an initial port to a renderer other than Hyperion, since internally all of Hyperion’s shading uses the Disney Bsdf, and all of our texturing is done through Ptex.
Our texturing also relies heavily on procedural <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/seexpr.html">SeExpr</a> expressions; all of the expression-drive texturing had to be baked down into Ptex for the final release.</p>

<p>Both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets are, quite frankly, enormous.
The Cloud data set contains a single OpenVDB cloud that weighs in at 2.93 GB; the data set also provides versions of the VDB file scaled down to half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth scale resolutions.
The Moana Island data set comes in three parts: a base package containing raw geometry and texture data, an animation package containing animated stuff, and a PBRT package containing a PBRT scene generated from the base package.
These three packages combined, uncompressed, weigh in at well over 200 GB of disk space; the uncompressed PBRT package along weighs in at around 38 GB.</p>

<p>For the Moana Island Scene, the provided PBRT scene requires a minimum of around 90 GB if RAM to render.
This many seem enormous for consumer machines, because it is.
However, this is also what we mean by “production scale”; for Disney Animation, 90 GB is actually a fairly mid-range memory footprint for a production render.
On a 24-core, dual-socket Intel Xeon Gold 6136 system, the PBRT scene took me a little over an hour and 15 minutes to render from the ‘shotCam’ camera.
Hyperion renders the scene faster, but I would caution against using this data set to do performance shootouts between different renders.
I’m certain that within a short period of time, enthusiastic members of the rendering community will end up porting this scene to Renderman and Arnold and Vray and Cycles and every other production renderer out there, which will be very cool!
But keep in mind, this data set was authored very specifically around Hyperion’s various capabilities and constraints, which naturally will be very different from how one might author a complex data set for other renderers.
Every renderer works a bit differently, so the most optimal way to author a data set for every renderer will be a bit different; this data set is no exception.
So if you want to compare renderers using this data set, make sure you understand the various ways how the way this data set is structured impacts the performance of whatever renderers you are comparing.</p>

<p>For example, Hyperion subdivides/tessellates/displaces everything to as close to sub-poly-per-pixel as it can get while still fitting within computational resources.
This means our scenes are usually very heavily subdivided and tessellated.
However, the PBRT version of the scene doesn’t come with any subdivision; as a result, silhouettes in the following comparison images don’t fully match in some areas.
Similarly, PBRT’s lights and lighting model differ from Hyperion’s, and Hyperion has various artistic controls that are unique to Hyperion, meaning the renders produced by PBRT versus Hyperion differ in many ways:</p>

The sand dune in the background looks particularly different from the Hyperion render due to subdivision and displacement."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 8a: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 8b: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. The palm leaves look especially different due to differences in artistic lighting shaping and curve shading differences. Most notably, the look in Hyperion depends heavily on attributes that vary along the length of the curve, which is something PBRT doesn't support yet. Some more work is needed here to get the palm leaves to look more similar between the two renders."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 9a: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 9b: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. Again, the significant difference in appearance in the rocks is probably just due to subdivision/tesselation/displacement."></a></p>

<p>Another example of a major difference between the Hyperion renders and the PBRT renders is in the water, which Hyperion renders using photon mapping to get the caustics.
The provided PBRT scenes use unidirectional pathtracing for everything including the water, hence the very different caustics.
Similarly, the palm trees in the ‘palmsCam’ camera angle look very different between PBRT and Hyperion because Hyperion’s lighting controls are very different from PBRT; Hyperion’s lights include various artistic controls for custom shaping and whatnot, which aren’t necessarily fully physical.
Also, the palm leaves are modeled using curves, and the shading depends on varying colors and attributes along the length and width of the curve, which PBRT doesn’t support yet (getting the palm leaves is actually the top priority for if more resources are freed up to improve the data set release).
These difference between renderers don’t necessarily mean that one renderer is better than the other; they simply mean that the renderers are different.
This will be true for any pair of renderers that one wants to compare.</p>

<p>The Cloud Data Set includes an example render from Hyperion, which implements our Spectral and Decomposition Tracking paper in its volumetric rendering system to efficiently render the cloud with thousands of bounces.
This render contains no post-processing; what you see in the provided image is exactly what Hyperion outputs.
The VDB file expresses the cloud as a field of heterogeneous densities.
Also provided is an example <a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> scene, renderable using the <a href="https://github.com/zhoub/mitsuba-vdb">Mitsuba-VDB plugin that can be found on Github</a>.
Please consult the README file for some modifications in Mitsuba that are necessary to render the cloud.
Also, please note that the Mitsuba example will take an extremely long time to render, since Mitsuba isn’t really meant to render high-albedo heterogeneous volumes.
With proper acceleration structures and algorithms, rendering the cloud only takes us a few minutes using Hyperion, and should be similarly fast in any modern production renderer.</p>

<p>One might wonder just why production data sets in general are so large.
This is an interesting question; the short answer across the industry basically boils down to “artist time is more expensive and valuable than computer hardware”.
We could get these scenes to fit into much smaller …</p></section></article></div></div>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="thumbnails ffmpeg" title="thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">
</figure>


<p>There are several easy ways to take screenshots/thumbnails of movies using FFmpeg. But why do this in the first place?</p>



<ol><li>You might want to generate thumbnails for your videos and show those thumbnails to the user when he scrolls through the video. </li><li>Or, you might want to compare two videos by doing a side-by-side comparison – this is quite common in video compression research. </li></ol>



<p>FFmpeg offers very simple techniques to extract screenshots or thumbnails at any position of the video (or rather, a way to dump frames at any point you choose). </p>



<p>Let’s see how! </p>




<h2><span id="Single_Screenshot/Thumbnail_Using_frames_v"></span>Single Screenshot/Thumbnail Using <code>-frames:v</code><span></span></h2>



<p>First, let’s understand how to take a single screenshot or thumbnail using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -frames:v 1 foobar.jpeg</code></pre>



<p>Understanding this is very simple! Here goes – </p>



<ol><li><code>-ss</code> is the seek command and it can be used to seek to the right position. For accurate seeking, you need to use output seeking and not input seeking (i.e., putting <code>-ss</code> before the input sequence). The syntax for specifying the time is <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to&nbsp;<code>01:02:03</code>&nbsp;– i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</li><li><code>-frames:v 1</code> tells FFmpeg to take only 1 screenshot. Note that, <code>-vframes</code> is deprecated. </li><li>then, you mention the name of the output file (<code>screenshot_10.jpg</code>). </li></ol>



<p>Simple, wasn’t it? Now that you know how to produce a single thumbnail or screenshot, let’s move to the next section where we understand how to create regular or periodic thumbnails.</p>



<h2><span id="Periodic_Screenshot/Thumbnail_with_Resizing"></span>Periodic Screenshot/Thumbnail with Resizing<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is another common use case that FFmpeg can solve easily – <strong>how do you take screenshots/thumbnails at regular intervals, and store them to JPG files after resizing them?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that can take care of creating a thumbnail and resizing it for you. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1080p.mp4 -r 1 -s 1280x720 -f image2 screenshot-%03d.jpg</code></pre>



<p>The <code>-r</code> command sets the output frame rate (=1) and <code>image2</code> is an image file muxer that is used to write video frames to image files. Using the <code>-s 1280x720</code> command, we can resize the video frames before writing them as images. Note, that the input video is a 1920x1080p video.</p>



<p>The above command will take a screenshot every 1 second. The screenshots would be named <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, etc. because we have specified the formatting as <code>%3d</code>.</p>



<p>However, in my experience, I have found this technique<strong> to be not frame-accurate</strong>.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s look at a more accurate way of extracting thumbnails. </p>



<h2><span id="Screenshot/Thumbnail_every_10_seconds"></span>Screenshot/Thumbnail every 10 seconds<span></span></h2>



<p>As an extension of the previous section, let’s do a quick exercise and learn how to create a thumbnail every 10 seconds using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n,300))',setpts='N/(30*TB)'" -f image2 thumbnail%03d.jpg</code></code></pre>



<p>Here, </p>



<ol><li>we use the <code>select</code> filter to extract a frame if the expression in single-quotes evaluates to non-zero. If the expression is zero, then <code>select</code> filter discards that frame.</li><li><code>mod(A,B)</code>&nbsp;returns the modulus (remainder after division) result after dividing A by B. So, if we divide 0 by 300, we get 0. Then, 1/300 is 1, and so on. </li><li><code>not</code> inverts this result. So, if the modulus is zero, then the final result is <code>1</code>. If the modulus is non-zero, then the result is evaluated to <code>zero</code>. </li><li>Based on this <code>not</code> operation, the <code>select</code> filter picks up a frame. </li></ol>



<p>The sequence I am using has a frame-rate of <code>30 fps</code>. And, I want a frame every 10 seconds. So, I have to choose a frame out of every 300 frames, right? That is why I used <code>select='not(mod(n,300))'</code></p>







<p>Depending on your sequence’s frame-rate, you can modify the command line shown. If you don’t know your video’s frame-rate, you can use <code>ffprobe</code> to find out. </p>



<pre><code>ffprobe -show_entries format=duration globe-with-timestamp.mp4</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – multiple easy ways to generate thumbnails and screenshots using FFmpeg. You can choose to take single screenshots or periodic ones with a highly frame-accurate technique! </p>

<p><i>After every crisis, some of the uncertainty becomes a part of our new reality. How, then, do you adapt and thrive when change is not a choice but inevitability? Let’s see.</i></p><p>Can you believe that Netflix is over two decades old?</p><p>The company has responded to changes (dot-com crash, global financial crisis, COVID-19) in a manner that in every period it seemed it belonged to those times, and sometimes even ahead of them. This once exclusively DVD-by-mail company started to build a streaming service in the early 2000s when most homes didn’t even have internet with enough bandwidth. Anticipating a shift in technology it sensed well in-advance how the consumption of media would change. The results? It has grown from 10m subscribers in 2010 to more than 160m in 2020.</p><p>We are good at finding solutions for today, but when it comes to the future, it’s human nature to see things in a state of positive permanence. Instinctively we tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. And this makes us not so good at preparing for uncertainty, much less manage it.</p><p>Successful businesses prepare for the unknown and use uncertain times as a chance to rethink their working norms. The throes of COVID-19 have sent a reminder for business leaders that continual re-examination of ongoing practices and assumptions is paramount.</p><p><b>Here’s a guide to help business strategists act amid uncertainty – and leverage the times to up their adaptability quotient and position themselves for success. </b></p><h4>Resilience: An Antidote for Business Uncertainty</h4><p>Uncertainty brings outcomes we never predicted or saw coming – whether it be a fire breakout and pipe burst or global pandemic. The problem deepens when you are left in limbo and can’t tell for how long the adversity will last, such as the coronavirus pandemic where businesses are still wondering about the shape and extent of economic recovery, and long-term impact on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights">business models</a> and consumer behavior. After all, what do you hold onto when you make plans in uncertainty? </p><p>In such times, resilience can become a valued characteristic for businesses.</p><p>It is not possible for anyone to be fully prepared for the unknown. But resilient organizations learn to expect the unexpected. It helps them rebound more quickly than others and take first-mover advantage of many opportunities that emerge. </p><p>Resilience is not the resistance to change, but one’s ability to embrace change. And be ready for it. It is reflected in how you react to the uncertainty; how fast you bounce back; and in what health do you remain in afterward. Instead of attempting to preserve what worked in the past, resilient leaders push past their fears, brainstorm new ideas, and embrace large-scale disruption. </p><p>In nutshell, resilience is a sign of an organization’s capacity to come back stronger than ever after having been knocked down by uncertainty. </p><p>But, how do you do that? How do you ensure you that adverse situations bend you, and not break you?</p><p>Resilience starts where new perspective meets experience. It is cumulated in how you look at change. </p><p>Finding a way to rise from the ashes requires rewiring your thinking for resilience and reorganize. We suggest three steps to achieve that.</p><p><img src="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/images/survive-adapt.jpg"></p><p> First, make peace with uncertainty. Understand what has changed, what led to it, and the need to get your business back on its foot, instead of staying down and defeated. Then, change your perspective. Swap your question of why this is happening to what it is trying to teach me. Finally, make changes to your present and prepare yourself to better handle the adversity in the future. Focus on growing with new strategies in place.</p><p> Leaders must understand the value of each step for developing resilience in the organization. Those who just rebound and survive may fall into the same trap again when faced with adversity the next time.</p><h4>Ten Sage Advices to Respond to COVID-19 Uncertainty</h4><p> When facts on the ground are incomplete and in flux, what you need to put in place an operational business is experimentation. Develop a culture of responding to uncertainty by rapidly hypothesizing, testing, learning from new trials, and adapting to the models that work. Here are a few actions <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/at-crossroads-taking-a-platform-approach-to-business">global business leaders</a> can take in this pandemic to beat the uncertainty blues and become resilient and agile.</p><ul><li><p><b>Operate with a sense of personal safety.</b> Great leadership is always about emotional connection. In this pandemic, as a primary responsibility, ensure that everyone in your organization is safe, secure, and healthy.</p></li><li><p><b> Achieve a level of business continuity.</b> Being functional, staying afloat, and carrying on is crucial in any uncertainty. Find a way to keep going on. Use virtual medium and collaborative tools. Focus on optimizing continuity thereafter.</p></li><li><p><b> Show signs of life.</b> Make your clients and customers know you are well and available.</p></li><li><p><b>Be less promotional &amp; more comforting in your messaging.</b> You can take either a direct marketing approach or you can be more sensitive by deploying a “hope all is well” campaign and the likes. Instead of a sales pitch, most global leaders are opting to touch base by asking about customers’/clients’ wellbeing and informing them of their availability lest they need their product or services.</p></li><li><p><b>Go multichannel and focus on customer-centricity.</b> Make a zero-tolerance declaration in your organization on any internal silos against customer-centricity. Ensure that your employees imbibe that in customers are the top priority in these times. Furthermore, don’t limit yourself to one channel for communication and operations. Experiment to find one or multiple best channels that best suit your needs.</p></li><li><p><b> Stay away from the herd mentality.</b> What is working for one company may not work for you. Find your new normal as you adapt every day. Mercilessly examine your weaknesses and vulnerabilities to become stronger for the long run. Destruct archaic practices to rebuild.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep a cool head.</b> It’s not uncommon for the dropping numbers to get your nerves. Don’t panic in these situations. It’s needless. Take a step back and see what you are left with. Gratitude for what you have can open a new world of possibilities. Look toward the long-term for more motivation.</p></li><li><p><b> Organize for rapid decision-making.</b> Uncertainty catches one off-guard. If you aren’t prepared, a crisis will overwhelm you. Distribute leadership responsibilities across your organization such that your employees are self-motivated and empowered to make decisions and operate with speed. A large part of this change is to give yourself (as an organization) the permission to be wrong in case things go south.</p></li><li><p><b>Make your offerings relevant to the times.</b> Use the uncertainty to gauge where customers’ propensities lie or would change in the future. Leverage new mediums and products/services of their choice to redesign your offerings and innovate.</p></li><li><p><b>Collaboration is the key to build resilience.</b> Startups are seen as a threat by incumbents, and vice-versa. However, a variety of collaborations between startups and incumbents can help each party survive, adapt, and thrive. Right collaboration would make it easy for both to raise capital, reduce cost, and position for growth. Forge joint ventures, or project-based relationship to come up with disruptive value propositions.</p></li></ul><h4> To Sum</h4><p> What type of leadership does uncertainty demand? The answer lies in resilience and agility. Enduring hard times are about leveraging, and not reacting to the turbulence around you. Lead by preparing your teams and organization to recreate the future with you. Adopt a new perspective to carve new normal, set a new vision, and imbibe new practices.</p><p><b> Business strategists who successfully lead their organizations through uncertainty not only survive, but also shields them from future disruptions by growing their adaptability quotient.</b></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ZuEG5yZkFwBjXBzoi6mFkQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>



<p>I’ll say it upfront for the techy people: (un)fortunately, <strong>this is NOT a MITM attack of U2F</strong>*. LastPass doesn’t support U2F so this is disappointingly simple. It uses Yubico OTP, which is phishable.</p>

<p>In this article, I demonstrate how to deploy a phishing attack on LastPass users, even when they are protected with Yubikey physical keys. I hope that this helps you appreciate that YubiKey ≠ U2F. Aside from that, I will give an overview of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what is U2F, and why it is important</li>
  <li>how LastPass encrypts and handles your vault</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*U2F stands for “Universal 2nd Factor”. This is the protocol that is likely used whenever you hear about security keys.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h4 id="use-security-keys-to-preventphishing">Use security keys to prevent&nbsp;phishing</h4>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8jei3TihbLKEG0vjuLGtew.png" alt="[Google’s transparency report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/overview?unsafe=dataset:0;series:malwareDetected,phishingDetected;start:1148194800000;end:1587279600000&amp;lu=unsafe)&nbsp;[1]">
<em><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/overview?unsafe=dataset:0;series:malwareDetected,phishingDetected;start:1148194800000;end:1587279600000&amp;lu=unsafe">Google’s transparency report</a>&nbsp;[1]</em></p>

<p>In recent years, phishing has proven to be one of the most effective ways of hacking people. Instead of using a fancy new exploit to steal a victim’s credentials, the hacker just asks the victims to hand their credentials over.</p>

<p>Moreover, with the new remote working conditions, we are more at risk of phishing attacks. This results in headlines such as <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/security/36691/phishing-attacks-increase-350-percent-amid-covid-19-quarantine">“Phishing Attacks Increase 350 Percent Amid COVID-19 Quarantine (2020)”</a> [2].</p>

<p>How do we combat this? Aside from educating employees on phishing attacks, security keys are an effective way to mitigate this increased risk. We see success stories such as (2018, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/">Google: Security Keys Neutralized Employee Phishing</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have had no reported or confirmed account takeovers since implementing security keys at Google”&nbsp;[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In a phishing attack, the weak point is the human user.</strong> The user has the responsibility to distinguishing legitimate vs malicious sites. <strong>By using security keys and protocols such as U2F, you relieve some of this burden from the user.</strong> Using U2F, authentication “magically” doesn’t work when it is a malicious site, even when the victim is tricked.</p>

<p>Below we see LastPass endorsing the use of YubiKeys. In the diagram, we see that YubiKey is more secure, easy to use, and not phishable.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JBB9n3hJZxZoTYBqD_IP0w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With that said, I recently got myself some Yubikeys. To use this “Advanced Multi-factor Option” with Lastpass, I needed a premium account. Being a long time user of Lastpass, I didn’t think twice and paid to upgrade to premium.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within minutes, I felt shortchanged. It quickly became obvious that using a Yubikey did not make my LastPass vault any more secure against phishing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why? Lastpass’s integration with Yubico using <strong><em>Yubico OTP and not U2F.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Here’s a list of levels of auth from the <em>“the Hierarchy of Auth”</em> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/beyond-passwords-2fa-u2f-and-google-advanced-protection/">[18]</a> from least secure to most secure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Password alone</li>
  <li>Password and SMS</li>
  <li>Password and soft token (LastPass + Google Authenticator)</li>
  <li>Password and hard token (LastPass + Yubico OTP)</li>
  <li><strong>Password and U2F (Security Keys)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>(3) and (4) give similar protections against phishing. (5) mitigates phishing best. So although we are using a Yubikey, we aren’t using it as a security key*.</p>

<p><em>Is this important and is U2F really THAT more secure?</em></p>

<p>Let me show you why this is important.</p>

<p><em>*Let’s reserve the term “security key” only when using U2F. So a YubiKey 5 can be used both in an OTP mode and security key mode.</em></p>

<h3 id="how-to-deploy-phishingcampaign">How to deploy phishing&nbsp;campaign</h3>

<p>Let’s take a red team mindset to appreciate why phishing is so effective and how easy it is for us to fall for it. We use a reverse proxy to do a “man-in-the-middle” (MITM) attack to steal the credentials and bypass 2 Factor Authentication (2FA).</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how a MITM attack works.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tBGvXDJ86Vgkm0QPKU_KDA.png" alt="We’re nice people. We will log-in LastPass for you">
<em>We’re nice people. We will log-in LastPass for you&nbsp;😊</em></p>

<p>Of course, phishing using MITM applies to many other sites. What makes LastPass unique is that it is the only site that I personally use that is still vulnerable to MITM even when using a Yubikey.</p>

<h4 id="information-gathering">Information Gathering</h4>

<p>Let’s say you have to target an individual or a company. You first try to get a small collection of email addresses from searching through LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, blogs, and other <a href="https://osintframework.com/">OSINT sources.</a></p>

<p>Now with these target emails, you explore the options available for your attack. The LastPass vault is a gold mine of credentials since one phishing attack can result in many credentials. Let’s see if these emails are possible LastPass users.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*oSRXFfUNTYvcO7-9wbnyuA.png" alt="google@gmail.com uses Lastpass?">
<em>google@gmail.com uses Lastpass?</em></p>

<p>Since the registration processes would check the availability of an email address, we can use it to gather more intel. If the email address is taken, then it is likely that the owner uses LastPass.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*QwVGvFSvUVQlAYkvGcjKhw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you want to enumerate a small list of potential targets, then you can use this simple API which returns ok/no.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET https://lastpass.com/create_account.php?check=avail&amp;skipcontent=1&amp;mistype=1&amp;username=google%40gmail.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For targeted attacks, this is an effective way to check whether or not you can be phished on LastPass. Broader random attacks would be unlikely if the availability endpoint is rate limited.</p>

<h4 id="getting-the-rightdomain">Getting the right&nbsp;domain</h4>

<p>Having a legitimate-looking domain might make it easier to trick the victim. There are a lot of ways that we can gain a legitimate-looking domain. Maybe slight modifications of the spelling or explore other TLDs. We chose <code>lastpass.com.es</code></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_JWMEckSw6ijACvtwABIKA.png" alt="As of 2020/05/25">
<em>As of 2020/05/25</em></p>

<p>Here are other examples of possible phishing domains for LastPass.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BgDfnRnQ8PF6UY3W-gdkiA.png" alt="As of 2020/05/25">
<em>As of 2020/05/25</em></p>

<p>These are domains that are affordable for a red team and individual hackers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you realize that in cases such as this one, a domain like <code>lastpass.com.es</code> is as suspicious as <code>lastpaazz.com</code> and <code>lastpass.club</code>.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-theservers">Setting up the&nbsp;servers</h4>

<p>To set up our phishing site I’ve prepared a <a href="https://github.com/pberba/evilginx2">fork of evilginx2</a>, which has some additional logic to steal the credentials from LastPass.</p>

<p>This is a golang application, so you would need to install golang and run the following commands:</p>



<p>It is surprising how mature the phishing tools are. The development of this only took around just a day. It is easy to set up phishing sites for your bank, or company website, complete with domain and SSL.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E0EMVroZkVYm9dbRNTSIgQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can set this up on your favorite cloud hosting provider. After setting up the binaries of <em>evilginx2.</em> You run it and then configure the LastPass phishlet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span> ./bin/evilginx <span>-p</span> ./phishlets/ <span>-developer</span>

<span>&gt;</span> config ip 127.0.0.1  
<span>&gt;</span> config domain lastpass.com.es

<span>&gt;</span> phishlets <span>hostname </span>lastpass lastpass.com.es  
<span>&gt;</span> phishlets <span>enable </span>lastpass
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then you create the link you want to bait them. The <code>redirect_url</code> is the page you want the victim to end up once you get all the necessary credentials.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> lures create lastpass  
<span>&gt;</span> lures edit redirect_url 0 <span>[</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v<span>=</span>dQw4w9WgXcQ]<span>(</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v<span>=</span>dQw4w9WgXcQ<span>)</span>  
<span>&gt;</span> lures get-url 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8m8tlF4QxxiU87_jYXdPpQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In our case, we want our victim to go <code>https://lastpass[.]com[.]es/QBFlGqJy</code></p>

<p>Note: For this to work locally you might need to add the following to <code>/etc/hosts</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>127.0.0.1 lastpass.com.es  
127.0.0.1 lp-cdn.lastpass.com.es  
127.0.0.1 www.lastpass.com.es
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="sending-the-phishingemail">Sending the Phishing&nbsp;Email</h4>

<p>Assuming that you use an existing phishlet, then we have to make a phishing email. This is really where a lot of the work comes in. You have to somehow trick the user into clicking the link. Crafting a good phishing email is an art.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ssc1naUhYfA6kPC6G_QonA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we say that we have revoked trusted devices so that hopefully, he won’t be surprised just in case he gets alerts of new log-ins.</p>

<h4 id="waiting-for-the-credentials">Waiting for the credentials</h4>

<p>When the victim clicks on the link, he will be redirected to the fake LastPass login.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Sn7hQ739Z9T4wthlcBymUg.png" alt="Notice lastpass.com.es">
<em>Notice lastpass.com.es</em></p>

<p>And when LastPass requires 2FA, then the fake website will ask the victim to provide the second factor.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oEpo4ztAWvEFgoCbZOgEJg.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/">previous work</a> [4] has mentioned, the victim will likely have to verify with their email because the logon activity is new. However, this might look less suspicious if we have already primed the victims to expect this by saying we’ve “revoked trusted devices”.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AFrkmKHksC6IO4B78C4evg.png" alt="Screenshot from [Versprite’s article](https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/)&nbsp;[4]">
<em>Screenshot from <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/">Versprite’s article</a>&nbsp;[4]</em></p>

<p>Once the session is trusted, the victim’s browser will start to download the encrypted vault. We steal this using the proxy along with the username and password of the victim.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jAXEAYqDL4WU1lPbzCwf3Q.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Afterward, the victim will be redirected a some chosen site. In this case, the victim will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">redirected to your chosen page.</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have all that we need to get all the victim’s credentials.</p>

<h4 id="decrypting-thevault">Decrypting the&nbsp;vault</h4>

<p>To decrypt the LastPass Vault, you would need 3 main ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LastPass Username</li>
  <li>LastPass Password</li>
  <li>Encrypted Vault</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WcIJmdRs2_ZxtPbe9RZKIA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With a MITM, we can steal the victim’s username and password, and once the session is trusted after OTP from the YubiKey, we can download the encrypted vault.</p>

<p>The original intention of the evilginx2 is to hijack the session. But I’ve found that it is easier to just dump the credentials in the vault. In theory, the proxy can get all necessary information to take takeover of the account.</p>

<p>In the project, I’ve provided a script <code>scripts/lastpass-python/dump_lastpass.py</code> This parses the evilginx2 DB and decrypts the credentials. The location of the DB depends on where the config file is. In my case it was <code>/var/root/.evilginx/data.db</code></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wja3kBicR48eBBy2c1vKcQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This creates two files, one for credentials of the LastPass accounts, and the other is the credentials found in the vaults. You have everything in the vault, name, folder, username, password, URL, and secure notes associated with the item.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*U-ZDsURt9ZhgYTMKTYICMQ.png" alt="creds-dump.csv">
<em>creds-dump.csv</em></p>

<p>You can easily leverage this to try to take control of as much of the accounts that you can. To maximize your impact, you can write a script to automatically check if there are recovery codes in the notes. With the passwords and the recovery codes, you will have full control of their accounts.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ftmKGyeE8GaoxoVJEXnH5g.png" alt="Should we put all our eggs in one&nbsp;basket?">
<em>Should we put all our eggs in one&nbsp;basket?</em></p>

<h4 id="quick-notes-onphishing">Quick Notes on&nbsp;Phishing</h4>

<p>Again, this problem is not specific to LastPass. You can be phished on almost any site you use. Some of them would have fewer protections than LastPass. However, among the main password managers, I think LastPass is the only one who still doesn’t support U2F.</p>

<p>How do we detect a phishing email?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is trivial for an attacker to copy the design of an email. In our example, you might be able to detect it using the source domain. …</p></div></div>

Some of these sites may only have minor contrast issues or maybe just a single missing <code>id</code>, while others are highly inaccessible. However, this number is pretty damn high, considering the fact that automatic testing tools <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/">only report obvious accessibility issues</a>.</p><div><p>Only 1.9% of the tested home pages pass automatic testing, which is fine, but it doesn’t mean that <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/">there aren’t any barriers on these websites</a> either.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Recently there was a security breach on Shopify, where two rogue employees stole customer data - names, emails, addresses as well as order details like products and services purchased.</p><p>Security breaches happen, to even the most popular websites - but what is important is the way companies react to these security breaches. Kylie Cosmetics handled this really well by doing the following:</p><p><strong>1. Being proactive.</strong></p><p>The security breach from Shopify affected 200 stores, and Kylie Cosmetics was the first store to publicly talk about the breach. Kylie Cosmetics emailed all their customers, and also uploaded information regarding the breach on their website. </p><p>Most people initially became aware of this security breach via Kylie Cosmetics. If you go through Shopify’s community forums you can see that customers initially became aware of this incident via emails from Kylie Cosmetics. It’s impressive that Kylie Cosmetics was the first store to publicize the incident. </p><p><strong>2. Taking ownership</strong></p><p>It is important to highlight that Shopify has not released the names of all the 200 stores that got compromised in this security breach. So, if Kylie Cosmetics didn’t talk about this incident (via emails and on their company website), there probably is no way that we would have ever known that Kylie Cosmetics is also one among this 200 stores that got compromised in this beach.</p><p>They could have easily stayed quiet and no one would have known that Kylie Cosmetics customer data was also compromised in this beach. Only a handful of stores have come out and publicly said that their customers details have also been leaked via this breach. We still have no idea which all stores got affected by this. So, props to Kylie Cosmetics for releasing this information to their customers.</p><p><strong>3. Being transparent and honest</strong></p><p>This security breach resulted from the actions of two Shopify’s employees - and not because of Shopify code or some other tech mishaps. Therefore, the impact of this breach is less. </p><p>Shopify has also stated that credit card details have not been compromised, and there is no evidence that the stolen information - names, emails, addresses and order details - have been used in any way. </p><p>There is a good chance that most of Kylie Cosmetics customers would not have even heard about this incident if not for emails from Kylie Cosmetics. So, considering that the impact of this security breach is very minimal - it is even more impressive that Kylie Cosmetics was transparent and honest about this from the beginning.</p><p><strong>4. Being the source and controlling the narrative</strong></p><p>All of Kylie Cosmetics customers first heard about this via emails from Kylie Cosmetics. Kylie Cosmetics controlled the narrative. They took responsibility and became the source of information regarding this security breach for their customers. It would have been really bad if their customers came to know of the breach from other media websites or from Shopify itself. </p><p>By being the source, they could also highlight what they are doing to recover from this incident. Kylie Cosmetics was also able to communicate that this incident is being looked into (Shopify has fired the two employees, launched an investigation, and also notified the FBI regarding this incident.), and that it is still safe to shop from the Kylie Cosmetics store.</p><p>Considering that this incident only affected 200 stores, and that Shopify has not released the names of the breached stores, I am impressed with the transparency shown by Kylie Cosmetics. Big props to Kylie Cosmetics for the way they handled the incident.</p><p>‍</p><p>Shopify has talked about the incident here: <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971">https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971</a></p><p>More information from Kylie Cosmetics regarding this here:<a href="https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/pages/faqs"> https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/pages/faqs</a><br></p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p><span>03 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Disney Animation’s Moana island dataset is a production-scale scene with memory requirements that make it challenging to render. This post summarizes some of those challenges, and describes how the <a href="https://github.com/chellmuth/gpu-motunui">GPU-Motunui</a> project is able to efficiently render the scene on a consumer-grade GPU with less than 8GB of memory. <a href="#renders">Click here</a> to skip ahead to the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-moana-island">The Moana island</h2>

<p>In 2018, Disney Animation released the Moana island dataset to the rendering research community. Compared to traditional research scenes, the scale of the Moana island scene is massive: the scene contains 90 million quad primitives, 5 million curves, and more than 28 million instances. All told, the island consists of over 15 billion primitives, weighing in at just under 30GB of geometry files.</p>

<p>The shots included with the dataset are beautiful, and showcase the amazing imagery that can be created by combining the best artists in the world with path tracing techniques and modern hardware. Here are two reference images, rendered with Disney’s proprietary Hyperion renderer:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="gpu-motunui-project">GPU-Motunui Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the GPU-Motunui project is to render all the Moana shots efficiently and accurately on a consumer-grade graphics card. There are two main challenges to accomplishing this with the Moana dataset. First, with a typical graphics card having only 8GB of memory, an out-of-core rendering solution is required to handle the large amounts of geometry. Second, the scene’s textures are provided in the Ptex format, and Ptex doesn’t have a publicly available CUDA implementation. This project currently only solves the first problem, and Ptex texture lookup is done on the CPU (although conveniently its cost is fully hidden by being computed concurrently with GPU shadow ray tracing).</p>

<p>The Hyperion reference images are impossible to match exactly; for example the varying brown and green colors along the palm tree fronds in the palmsCam shot are not provided in the dataset. Other features of the scene are possible to render but out of my initial scope, notably subdivision surfaces and their displacement maps, and a full Disney BSDF implementation.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>All ray tracing operations are run through Nvidia’s OptiX 7 API. This means GPU-Motunui gets the full benefits of available RT cores and a world-class BVH implementation. The following sections describe how GPU-Motunui maps dataset assets to OptiX data structures, and how GPU-Motunui’s out-of-core rendering solution works.</p>

<h3 id="scene-representation">Scene representation</h3>

<p>The Moana scene makes widespread use of multi-level instancing. In OptiX, this requires a three-level hierarchy of acceleration structures to manage: two levels of IASs, and a base level of GASs (Instance Acceleration Structures and Geometry Acceleration Structures, respectively). GPU-Motunui makes use of OptiX’s AS compaction and relocation APIs to further reduce memory usage.</p>

<p>The isHibiscus element makes a good example of how a typical element in the scene is organized and built. The tree is assembled from a base model in one Wavefront .obj file (containing the trunk and branches), and four primitives: one flower and three leaf models (each with their own .obj file).</p>

<div>

<p>Left: The four simple primitives that will be instanced to fill out the hibiscus tree <br>Right: The base trunk and branches model </p>
</div>

<p>In OptiX, each of these models has an associated GAS, and each GAS can be subdivided into multiple build inputs. Build inputs are used to map sections of the model to information needed at shading time by indexing into OptiX’s shader binding table. These GASs form the bottom level of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Next, an IAS is used to build the full isHibiscus element. This IAS is in the middle level of the hierarchy. The figure below shows each primitive’s instances in isolation, and combined to make the full element:</p>

<div>

<p>Left: Isolated instances for each primitive<br>Right: Full isHibiscus element</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, a second IAS is built to track all of the element’s instances present in the scene. This second IAS is the top level of the instance hierarchy.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/isHibiscus-instanced-elements.png" alt="The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances"></p><p>The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances</p>
</div>

<p>Although the isHibiscus element has a typical structure, there are some more complicated elements included in the dataset. The isCoral element, for example, has different base geometry and instanced primitives for each of its element instances, but the underlying primitive geometries are shared across all the element instances.</p>

<p>The Moana GAS and IASs alone require 18.5 GB, well past the memory budget of my 8GB RTX 2070. Because OptiX has no native support for out-of-core rendering, the traditional OptiX pipeline had to be put aside for a custom-made solution.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-core-rendering">Out-of-core rendering</h3>

<p>To solve the out-of-core rendering problem, GPU-Motunui divides the scene’s geometry into different sections, and ray traces each separately, while tracking the closest hit. Replacing a traditional device trace call with a host loop comes with many design consequences to the renderer, from asset loading to the core path tracing loop that sends rays through the scene.</p>

<p>Before rendering, the asset loading process allocates a large chunk of GPU memory (currently 6.7GB). A custom allocator is implemented that manages this block of memory. It is responsible for allocating two types of memory: output and temporary. Output memory is allocated from the left of the block, and is used for OptiX structures. Temporary memory is managed on a stack from the right end of the memory block. Managing the temporary memory this way ensures that the output structures are always tightly packed.</p>

<p>After elements are processed into their accelerator structures on the GPU, their used memory is snapshotted onto the host, and the allocator is cleared. The process is repeated until all of the scene’s geometry is processed, resulting in the host managing a list of GPU memory snapshots. The figure below shows an example layout of GPU memory that could be snapshotted:</p>

<div>
  <p>GPU memory layout after loading the isHibiscus element.<br>(Dotted arrows show that an IAS holds instances of the pointed-at AS)</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, when it comes time to ray trace, each snapshot is processed in a loop. This means a call to <code>cudaMemcpy</code> and <code>optixLaunch</code> for each snapshot. A global buffer is maintained that indicates the depth of the current closest intersection. This value is used as the <code>tmax</code> parameter for the CUDA kernel’s call to <code>optixTrace</code>, and a successful intersection will update the depth buffer for the next launch.</p>

<p>In a traditional OptiX path tracer, the entire render loop can run in device code inside a single call to <code>optixLaunch</code>; i.e., a successful intersection will lead to more BSDF and shadow rays being traced in the same kernel launch. Because GPU-Motunui’s design mandates multiple launches for tracing each path segment, the render loop is pulled out into host code. While this potentially diminishes OptiX’s ability to efficiently schedule program execution, it also opens up opportunties for optimization, such as running Ptex texture lookups on the CPU concurrently with GPU kernels and I/O.</p>

<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>As with any OptiX application, GPU-Motunui makes use of the shader binding table (SBT). SBT records contain pointers to normal buffers and material attributes. The underlying data for the normal buffers is stored alongside OptiX acceleration structures and included in geometry snapshots. This ensures that GPU memory is never wasted on unreachable normal buffer data.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>
<p>Included below are GPU-Motunui renders of the six scenes included in the dataset. shotCam is the slowest to render at 18.2 seconds per sample at 1024x429 resolution, and took just over five hours total for the final image. All shots are 1024spp, capped at a maximum of five bounces, and were run on an Nvidia RTX 2070.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of the renderer required 42.6 seconds per 1spp on the shotCam scene. A few optimizations combined to make significant reductions in rendering time, cutting each pass down to 18.2 seconds (a 57.3% reduction).</p>

<h4 id="cpugpu-concurrency">CPU/GPU concurrency</h4>
<p>Tracing shadow rays on the GPU in parallel with Ptex lookups on the CPU cut rendering time by 23.4%. It was disappointing to be forced to do texture lookups on the CPU, but the time savings make up for it.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-ptex-caches">Multiple Ptex caches</h4>
<p>Parallelizing the Ptex lookups and using multiple Ptex caches eliminated texture lookups as a bottleneck to the system; shadow ray casting time fully dominates the texture lookup. Empirically, spawning two threads per core (totaling 12 on an Intel i7-8700K) and sharing three Ptex caches comfortably reduced the texture lookup time beneath the shadow ray budget. This improved the time savings to a 33.9% reduction over the baseline.</p>

<h4 id="pinned-memory">Pinned memory</h4>
<p>The acceleration structure snapshots are all saved to pinned host memory. Switching from normal to pinned host memory increased the transfer throughput from 7.73 GB/s to 11.84 GB/s, cutting the baseline render time by 19.5%.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>Getting this scene running on my RTX 2070 card was a very fun and rewarding project, but there are still many improvements to be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing the Disney BSDF</li>
  <li>Rendering subdivision surfaces along with displacement mapping</li>
  <li>More efficiently packing the acceleration structures, and optimizing ray tracing throughput</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how various research results hold up on production scenes (e.g., testing select path guiding techniques)</li>
</ul>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Do you truly control your content if you post it on Medium?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/02/image-4.png"></figure><p>At the beginning of this year, I switched from Medium to a static site powered by Ghost. Although <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is a strong choice if you have paying subscribers, it is impossible to beat static hosting for a simple blog. Static sites are fast, secure, and free.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of my reasoning and approach - from editing in Ghost's world-class UI to deploying for free on a static hosting provider like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>I was looking for a blogging solution that met these requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slick UI:</strong> Even though I use vim and markdown daily, I prefer a Medium-like freeform writing experience.</li><li><strong>Self-hosted: </strong>Full control of my content with no vendor lock-in, paywalls, or subscription pop-ups.</li><li><strong>High availability:</strong> I should never receive a monitoring alert for my personal blog.</li><li><strong>Exceptional performance:</strong> I want the page to load fast!</li><li><strong>Secure and low-maintenance:</strong> After supporting dozens of WordPress sites over more than a decade, I have grown weary of hacked plugins and frequent patching cycles.</li></ul><h2 id="static-ghost-io-">Static Ghost.io 👻</h2><p>Even though I use markdown every day in my work, I prefer the WYSIWYG writing experience of a web UI. Ghost's UI is fantastic!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/10/nm_ghost.png"></figure><p>The main drawback of Ghost is the same as WordPress: every request depends on a database. Each time a user visits a page on the site, the following steps take place:</p><ol><li>The web server passes the end user's request to a running application server (Node.js for Ghost, PHP for WordPress).</li><li>The application server analyzes the incoming request and dispatches requests to the database for necessary content (MySQL for Ghost).</li><li>The application server renders the content from the database into a web page.</li><li>The web server passes the resulting page back to the end user.</li></ol><p>This architecture requires significant compute and memory resources on both the application server and database server. &nbsp;It is susceptible to performance issues due to spikes in demand. And achieving high availability requires a database cluster and web load balancer. Lots of distinct parts to deploy, secure, and operate.</p><p>The advent of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> architecture has brought static sites into the limelight. By moving steps 2 and 3 <strong>to the beginning</strong>, Ghost can generate each page on the site <strong>in advance</strong>. Then, it's easy to upload the static site to a free or almost-free hosting provider (see below for suggestions).</p><blockquote>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. - JAMstack</blockquote><p>Static sites have a significantly smaller attack surface than sites driven by databases and application code. Bugs, vulnerabilities, and build issues can be identified by the build phase, rather than when the site is live. </p><p>You get the rich editing of Ghost while enjoying all of the operational and cost advantages of a static JAM site:</p><ul><li>Never worry about scaling when traffic spikes.</li><li>Never apply a critical security patch at midnight.</li><li>Who cares if your Ghost database is temporarily down?</li></ul><h2 id="making-ghost-static">Making Ghost Static</h2><p>First, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/setup/">private Ghost instance</a> to use for editing, formatting, and peer review. This can be a very small VM, since it doesn't have to serve any production traffic. Defying traditional best-practices, it's even safe to co-locate MySQL on the same system! <a href="https://valet.ghost.org/">Ghost(Valet)</a> is very reasonably priced if you need a hand with this step.</p><p>You can secure access to this system with a firewall or VPN. A better approach is to use an authentication proxy like <a href="https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy">oauth2-proxy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium">pomerium</a> for a user-friendly, "zero trust" solution.</p><p>Then, use Ghost Static Site Generator (<code>gssg</code>) &nbsp;to create a static mirror of the site that is hosted by Netlify:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator"><div><p>Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p>Generate a static site from ghost and deploy using a CI - Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19606031?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p><code>gssg</code> will spider your local Ghost site, creating a fully static copy. Here's the short Makefile I use:</p><pre><code>all:
	rm -rf static/
	gssg --url https://www.nedmcclain.com --domain http://127.0.0.1:2368
	cp ghost/etc/keybase.txt static/
	cp static/404/index.html static/404.html</code></pre><p>You can publish this copy to your Netlify site with their CLI or by (recommended) linking a Git repository. Netlify <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">offers</a> 100GB of bandwidth/month for free, which is plenty for most use cases. They also take care of TLS certificates automatically.</p><figure><a href="https://www.netlify.com/"><div><p>Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects</p><p>Deploy modern static websites with Netlify.

Say goodbye to Ghost's <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/">library of integrations</a>, and you won't be able to monetize with Ghost's <a href="https://ghost.org/members/">membership and subscription management</a>.</p><p>It's easy to include contact/feedback forms with tools like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/">Netlify Forms</a> or <a href="https://upscribe.io/">Upscribe</a>. You can embed rich media, social media, and all kinds of Javascript widgets (weather, news, etc.). But if you intend to have users login to your site, you'll need a database-backed service.</p><p>For paid creators, Substack is growing in popularity with its focus on newsletters. Truly complex sites with many editors should evaluate Drupal or consider custom development. But I would encourage you to check out <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> - your subscription goes back into the Ghost foundation, making the software even better.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In the last 10 weeks Ghost has made over $140,000 for independent publishers, creators and newsletters — all while our new membership functionality is still in beta!</p><p>Growth for the last 6 months or so has been pretty nuts, and we've got some big releases coming up :)</p></div>— John O'Nolan 🏴‍☠️ (@JohnONolan) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnONolan/status/1311957056698499072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>So first off a personal update – last year, I got laid off the day I returned from maternity leave! Within a half hour of returning to my desk! Whew boy! It was a blessing in disguise in some ways, because 1) I’d been thinking for some time I could be more effective in a consulting role and 2) as part of my severance package, I got to attend a General Assembly coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>I ended up auditing the bootcamp because wow, it demands a ton of sacrifice with the end goal of getting a developer job. In contrast, I am happy to do a bit of scripting on the side, work with developers, and improve their experiences. Nonetheless, I worked through all the lectures, did a few homework assignments, and got a lot out of it. Not the least of which is that I validated my existing coding skills, gained deeper insight into the “junior developer” persona, and reaffirmed my conviction that tailoring your developer experience and docs to junior developers is a <strong>Good Thing</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of big takeaways I’d like to share:</p>

<h3 id="everyone-is-a-junior-developer">Everyone is a junior developer</h3>

<p>Well, no, not actually … but every developer has to learn new concepts.  And yes, of course, as you gain experience as a developer, “totally new” concepts get rarer and rarer. Still, there’s a lot of learning:</p>

<p>Some developers must learn a breakneck pace (think of all the Javascript frameworks coming out all the time! Those front-end folks have to sprint just to stay in place). Others face big disruptions to their coding world only occasionally (your Enterprise Java programmer with a 20 year career in monolithic app development who now lives in a brave new world of microservices, CI/CD, devops, oh my!)</p>

<p>I felt I experienced this disruption myself as part of the coding bootcamp. Up till then, my background was in writing Python scripts, and in documenting big Java applications in a analytics microservices context. I knew about RedHat, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Lucene, Cassandra, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I was learning about a whole new world: the ecosystems, the mindset, the business of ….  JavaScript.  Like probably many people outside the JavaScript world, I was fooled by the “script” part of the name – especially since I’d only used JavaScript myself to write macros in an XML docs tool.  Now I realize it’s <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2886368/java-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mindshare.html">epic battle</a> between Java and JavaScript. And while I haven’t fallen in love (Python, you still have my heart), I had lots of “oh, that’s neat!” moments. I also recognized that my learning curve was not dissimilar to that of experienced – but JavaScript-naïve – developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-all-design-for-the-junior-developer">We should all design for the junior developer</h3>

<p>Creating experiences with a junior developer in mind forces you to discard your comfy assumption that everyone’s drunk your product Kool-aid. If you assume you’re writing for someone who’s technically savvy and can learn quickly, but who knows nothing about your world, you’re positioning yourself to vastly decrease your developer onboarding friction. And if you assume that your “junior developer” is super impatient because they have, like, 10 other things on the docket to learn about, then you’ll learn to answer up front the question: “why should I care? Why should I do this work?”</p>

<p>It’s a fine line to tread, assuming not too much about technical knowledge, but also not coming across as condescending or silly (like, at the level of “open a terminal by taking the following steps…”). Still, I think it’s actually quite achievable. For example, it’s quite low effort to provide high-level context for coding instructions. Even something as simple as “Clone this repository and open a terminal at the local directory location” is a direction that often gets left out in GitHub readmes…but it really shouldn’t be left out.  And it never hurts to link to frameworks’ getting started guides, even if you don’t want to provide the details yourself. At the very least, no one is likely to roll their eyes at it, and it helps your reader understand what level of granularity your instructions will provide.</p>

<p>When I look for inspiration, I think the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React newbie tutorials</a> do an outstanding job of introducing junior developers to React, helping them understand why they should care, and explicitly stating their audience. I also really love (who doesn’t) the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe developer onboarding</a> experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think I came away from the coding bootcamp more confident that I <em>am</em> a junior developer. And while I’d never make the classic UX mistake of thinking I am the user, still – my confusions, my pain points in learning about a product– these are things that other developers likely share.</p>

<h3 id="postscript-fun-with-javascript">Postscript: Fun with Javascript!</h3>

<p>I’ll end on another personal note. The coding bootcamp turned out to be quite serendipitous, because I took on contracting work that immediately benefited from my new knowledge. I’d just learned about Express, and now here I was, entering a pull request to change the authentication method for an Express server. I’d just learned about React, and now here I was, wading into a web UI to change some text. It’s always nice when you can put what you’ve learned to immediate use.</p>

<p>The <i>VFX Forth for Linux</i> family consists of a 64 bit version for x86_64 and 32-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM versions built from the same code tree as the Windows and Mac OS/X versions; please refer to the <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/software/pc-systems/vfx-forth-common-features/">Common features</a> page for a more detailed description of aspects common to all versions, e.g. code generation. VFX Forth for Linux also works on FreeBSD with the Linux compatibility layer installed.</p>
<p>The current release is v5.1. This release includes code generation changes, an improved shared library interface, the GTK+ cross-platform GUI code, a port of Bernd Paysan’s Minos and Theseus GUI designer, and Hanno Schwalm’s fJACK audio interface.</p>

Release notes for all earlier versions of VFX Forth can be found <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/arena/relhist.vfx.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The ARM version works on all 32 bit distributions that support the EABI – that’s most everything these days, including the Raspberry Pi and the Beaglebone Black.</p>
<p>A customer said:<br>
<em>“Besides the amazing optimizing compiler, I love the DocGen documentation system. The easy C interfacing and Genio driver architecture have also been key for my project. And finally, I can even generate turnkey apps customized for my eBox 2300SX.” </em></p>


<h2>GTK+ Cross Platform GUI</h2>
<hr>
<p>We have settled on GTK+ as a suitable cross-platform GUI library. Now that we have VFX Forth for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, it was time to take the original Linux interface more seriously. Now the GTK+ interface is cross platform, so it’s one of the <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/software/pc-systems/vfx-forth-common-features/">common</a> features.The four pictures are from Windows, Mac OS X, x86 Linux and ARM Linux. All four were produced by compiling the same source code with no changes. The library interface file contains a small amount of conditional compilation for library file names, but that’s all that changes between operating systems.</p>

<h2>Minos and Theseus</h2>
<hr>
<p>Minos is an OOP-based GUI display system and widget library written by Bernd Paysan, ported to VFX Forth and released under an LGPL license. It is dependent only on the presence of the X-Windows libraries and the OpenGL libraries for graphics displays. As a consequence, it uses little RAM and can be used on low-powered systems.</p>
<p>Theseus is the GUI designer component, also by Bernd Paysan and released under LGPL. The screenshot below shows it in use constructing a prototype GUI front-end for VFX Forth.</p>
<p>LGPL exemptions and technical support contracts for Minos and Theseus are available separately. Minos and Theseus are supplied with all editions of VFX Forth for Linux.</p>
<center><img src="https://www.mpeforth.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/menuexample1.png" alt="Theseus screenshot" width="769" height="599">&nbsp;<em>Theseus</em><a name="examples"></a></center><center></center>&nbsp;


<h2>Examples and Libraries</h2>
<hr>
<p>VFX Forth comes with a wide range of application examples.</p>
<p>Libraries include multitasking, floating point, serial and socket-based communications, benchmarks, BNF parsers, binary overlays, full file system support, and more than a dozen application-oriented examples to get you off to a flying start.</p>
<p>VFX Forth for ARM Linux includes a direct GPIO access example for the Raspberry Pi with a bit toggle rate of about 10 MHz using the generic GPIO functions, and somewhat faster using functions dedicated to the peripheral pin. Root privilege is required. This example can easily be modified for other ARM Linux platforms. It is particularly useful for writing simple peripheral drivers in user space, e.g. I2C master – no kernel driver required.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><b>x86_64/AMD64:</b> Any 64 bit Linux with 64 bit libraries; all 64 bit distros that we know about</li>
<li><b>x86:</b> Any version of x86 Linux with 32-bit libraries, e.g. any Red Hat or Debian distribution or derivative. An x87 compatible maths co-processor is required for floating-point maths.</li>
<li><b>ARM</b> Any version of ARM Linux with EABI support and 32-bit libraries, e.g. any Red Hat or Debian distribution or derivative. A VFP floating point unit is required for floating-point maths.<a name="mpecomp"></a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatible with other MPE Products</h2>
<hr>
<p>The VFX Forth kernel is source-code compatible with MPE’s Forth cross compilers, and compatibility for other versions of VFX Forth for Windows or Mac OS X has been made simple.</p>

I've led dozens of meetings in the past.  Typically I need to invest prep time and create a fancy PowerPoint presentation or a document outlining the steps for a new process.  I deliver my presentation, wrapping up with a summary of the most important points.  Ultimately I ask if there are any questions with maybe one or two questions popping up, but usually, there aren't any.</p><p id="viewer-7k88h">But the fact that there are typically very few questions gives me an uneasy feeling and reduces my confidence that the topic of the meeting was grasped by the attendants.  I know that I will need to follow-up with them or put in place measurements to ensure the message was received. </p><p id="viewer-378ak">Since my messaging isn't reaching my team effectively,  I started to ask myself how I can improve.  What can I do to make my messaging clearer?  Is my messaging too complicated? What can I do to get my team more engaged?  How can I get acknowledgment that the message was understood?</p><p id="viewer-43fli">Going through this process made me realize that the more engaged I was, the more questions I asked.  The more I wanted to learn about what the real issue was, the more questions I asked.  Maybe if I provide an environment that encouraged questions, or asking more questions, the more confident I would feel that my message was received.  </p><h3 id="viewer-em0if"><strong>Receiving more questions</strong></h3><p id="viewer-81r8h">Many management teams from older or traditional companies aren't open to receiving questions.  The inquiries might be perceived as a challenge to their authority or even worse a challenge to their expertise.  Leaders might feel they are expected to be all-knowing but questions can help leaders know what they don't know.    I don't expect the CEO of a large company to know everything about every single job function.  How could she?  She relies on people to distill the most important information from those that report directly to her.   For instance, a CEO might have many layers between them and the customers.  Would a CEO have a better perspective about her customers by seeing a dashboard with a CSAT score over a frontline support team member who works directly with the customers every day? </p><p id="viewer-cf02t">When everybody wants answers, asking more questions can feel like a distraction.  The management team could also feel frustrated by having to explain and rationalize all the things.  But if you haven't provided enough information to your employees, how can they be expected to believe in the mission.  The mind--at least my mind-- doesn't like unanswered questions and tends to create answers from the information at hand and use copious amounts of assumptions to fill in any missing gaps.  Many of those assumptions come from the "the sky is falling" segment of the brain. Being receptive to employees asking questions can fill those gaps with qualified information.</p><p id="viewer-d53j5">Questions can disrupt long-standing processes, methods, and practices.  I would argue that these practices should be among the first things questioned.  Many times we habitually go through the motions of these processes without thinking.  This blocks inspiration. Stepping back and questioning the process can improve your decision making.</p><p id="viewer-fvek5">Leveraging all the different perspectives, backgrounds, and unique experiences of the workforce can raise important issues, and focus resources are more important tasks.  </p><h3 id="viewer-ee6si"><strong>Growing People Through Questions</strong></h3><p id="viewer-7td3">Much of my background is in support so I relate stories to that specific department.  I often see larger support organizations provide a more scripted environment for handling support interactions.  They push reliance on tools like internal knowledgebases, runbooks, and response templates to provide a consistent support experience.  I would first like to state that all these tools are important in any support organization and can greatly speed up the onboarding process for new employees. The downside of over-reliance on those tools is that they can reduce the ability of the frontline personnel to learn, master the service or product they are supporting, reduce their ability to view issues from a different perspective, and ultimately not inspire them to ask questions.</p><p id="viewer-68i8f">To illustrate what I mean, I can go over an example of following a recipe. Since I love curry, we'll use that. I'm hoping to avoid being flamed by Thai Curry purists, but to keep things simple, below is a basic list of ingredients for a Thai green curry:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6ccr6"><p>1 can curry paste</p></li><li id="viewer-9m72i"><p>1 can coconut milk</p></li><li id="viewer-e99pf"><p>1 cup chicken broth</p></li><li id="viewer-5ia38"><p>1 tbsp sugar</p></li><li id="viewer-74ljv"><p>2 tsp fish sauce</p></li><li id="viewer-8r5et"><p>1 eggplant</p></li><li id="viewer-321ur"><p>1 chicken breast</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-bujht">The steps to actually prepare a curry aren't relevant to this example but you can make a good curry with that small list of ingredients.  After completing the recipe a few times, you probably won't need to use the directions as you will have memorized it and be able to produce a good result consistently without thinking. </p><p id="viewer-a7k4b">Now, what do you do if someone wants their curry with more spice?  Or less spice? Or they were out of Eggplants at the market? Or out of the certified organic chicken breast you like?  Many people will go search for another recipe.  But what if I had originally provided you with the basics of what curry was and asked you to make a curry using that framework?  A more generic ingredient list might be:</p><ul><li id="viewer-3n73p"><p>A curry paste made up of primarily Thai chiles, garlic, lemongrass, spices, ginger, and green onions</p></li><li id="viewer-6pf36"><p>Chicken broth </p></li><li id="viewer-4tf8e"><p>Can of coconut milk</p></li><li id="viewer-c80kh"><p>Sugar to sweeten</p></li><li id="viewer-i0oh"><p>Fish oil for saltiness</p></li><li id="viewer-djrqg"><p>Any Vegetables</p></li><li id="viewer-1hlid"><p>Any Poultry/Beef/Seafood</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-fnfts">You would gain a better understanding through trial and error.  Yes, the first, second, or maybe even third curry you make might be horrible. But that fourth one--amazing.  Through asking yourself questions you learn more about how to be more flexible based on the available ingredients.  What do I do if it's too spicy?   How can I make it sweeter? Can I use some of the vegetables I found at the farmers' market?  Can I use shrimp?   Now you can make better decisions as you understand how all the ingredients relate to each other.</p><p id="viewer-7rbms">Answering a question doesn't always solve the problem.  With support, you first need to understand the problem (empathy skills) and deliver the correct response (knowledge skills).   Larger support organizations are looking for keywords in the text or prefabricated response.  Sometimes a customer is only describing the symptom so asking what the end goal is (either internal dialogue or actually asking the customer) is key to figuring out what the real issue is and providing a knowledgeable response.  So instead of handing them a script for every possible customer inquiry, provide them with a basic framework to start with and build upon that. An example customer interaction framework:</p><ol><li id="viewer-8dsld"><p>What is the real issue/goal of the customer?</p></li><li id="viewer-c8vqt"><p>What is the best way to resolve this issue?</p></li><li id="viewer-2uv2s"><p>What are the expected results of the solution?</p></li><li id="viewer-16hvl"><p>What are the next steps?</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-9l0v2">Checklists and processes have their place in basic operations like closing an account, updating billing information, or other tasked based operations. Most interactions with customers require empathy and understanding to start to solve their root issue.</p><h2 id="viewer-fpg6i"><strong>How can we encourage questioning?</strong></h2><p id="viewer-b7moa">For starters, we need to provide an environment that not only welcomes questions but encourages them.  Facebook and Google (and I'm sure others do as well) have weekly question and answer sessions with the CEO.  Questions are submitted through a message board and then upvoted by other employees.  The CEO then takes time every week to answer the highest upvoted questions.  The message board gives an opportunity for employees to ask questions whenever inspiration reveals itself.   Often inspiration doesn't always follow after your manager asks "Are there any questions" in that late afternoon meeting.</p><p id="viewer-8i799">Also important is to provide a safe environment for asking questions.   There should be the ability to ask a question without fear of reprisal or having the question answered in a condescending or judgemental way.  All questions should be listened to intently and answered with respect.</p><p id="viewer-4minh">Perhaps the hardest questions for individuals to ask are questions that might cause more responsibility or work for them.  "Why are we not are we not doing X?" can lead to "That's a great idea, now you do X in addition to your current duties".  Which could make an employee less interested in asking good questions.  To mitigate that feeling, you could follow up the "That's a great idea!" by asking how they would like to contribute to making that a reality or if they would like to contribute at all.  </p><p id="viewer-5h7ut">Offer training on asking questions.  I find the best questions contain some or all of the following elements:</p><ol><li id="viewer-5aikg"><p>Open-ended</p></li><li id="viewer-bt1jk"><p>No personal attacks</p></li><li id="viewer-3i6jb"><p>Non-leading</p></li><li id="viewer-4eb11"><p>Challenge assumptions</p></li><li id="viewer-f20bt"><p>Ask only one question at a time</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-817ng">That's not a definitive list, and there are certainly more elements to qualifying a question as good or not, but it is a starting point.</p><h2 id="viewer-7he0t"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="viewer-ehs97">Asking questions is the best path to learning, creativity, and understanding.  Providing an environment that promotes questions has many advantages from growing frontline personnel as well as challenging upper management to communicate more effectively.  Questions can strengthen trust between manager and employee and improve belief in the company or group mission.  An insightful question from one individual can create an eruption of creativity from all parts of an organization making the whole stronger than the sum of the parts.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>
Somewhere in the concrete canyons of New York City a
recently formed rock group is using the name Jim Jones and
the Suicides. Irreverent and disarming, the name reflects
the new trend in punk rock, to take social issues head on.
Cynicism about the Jonestown deaths and its social
parallels abound in the lyrics of today's music. The
messages are clear because we all know the story.

</p><div><p>
In fact, people today recognize the name "Jonestown"
more than any other event, a full 98% of the population.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</span>
The television and printed media were filled with the news
for more than a year, even though the tale read like
something from the <i>National Enquirer</i> tabloid. But
despite all the coverage, the reality of Jonestown and the
reasons behind the bizarre events remain a mystery. The
details have faded from memory for most of us since
November 18, 1978, but not the outlines. Think back a
moment and you'll remember.

<br>
<a name="p1">

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
You Know the Official Version
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
A fanatic religious leader in California led a
multiracial community into the jungles of remote Guyana to
establish a socialist utopia. The People's Temple, his
church, was in the heart of San Francisco and drew poor
people, social activists, Blacks and Hispanics, young and
old. The message was racial harmony and justice, and
criticism of the hypocrisy of the world around his
followers.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]</span>

</p><p>
The Temple rose in a vacuum of leadership at the end of
an era.  The political confrontations of the 60s were
almost over, and religious cults and "personal
transformation" were on the rise. Those who had preached a
similar message on the political soap box were gone, burnt
out, discredited, or dead. The counter-culture had
apparently degenerated into drugs and violence. Charlie
Manson was the only visible image of the period. Suddenly,
religion seemed to offer a last hope.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Even before they left for the Jonestown site, the
People's Temple members were subjects of local scandal in
the news.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]</span> Jim Jones claimed these exposés were
attacks on their newly-found religion, and used them as an
excuse to move most of the members to Guyana.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn5">5</a>]</span> But
disturbing reports continued to surround Jones, and soon
came to the attention of congressional members like Leo
Ryan. Stories of beatings, kidnapping, sexual abuse and
mysterious deaths leaked out in the press.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn6">6</a>]</span> Ryan decided
to go to Guyana and investigate the situation for himself.
The nightmare began.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn7">7</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Isolated on the tiny airstrip at Port Kaituma, Ryan and
several reporters in his group were murdered. Then came the
almost unbelievable "White Night," a mass suicide pact of
the Jonestown camp. A community made up mostly of Blacks
and women drank cyanide from paper cups of <i>Kool-Aid</i>,
adults and children alike died and fell around the main
pavilion. Jones himself was shot in the head, an apparent
suicide. For days, the body count mounted, from 400 to
nearly 1,000. The bodies were flown to the United States
and later cremated or buried in mass graves.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn8">8</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Temple member Larry Layton is still facing charges of
conspiracy in Ryan's murder. Ryan was recently awarded a
posthumous Medal of Honor, and was the first Congress
member to die in the line of duty.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn9">9</a>]</span>

</p><div><p>
Pete Hammill called the corpses "all the loose change
of the sixties."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn10">10</a>]</span> The effect was electric. Any
alternative to the current system was seen as futile, if
not deadly. Protest only led to police riots and political
assassination. Alternative life styles and drugs led to
"creepy-crawly" communes and violent murders.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn11">11</a>]</span> And
religious experiments led to cults and suicide. Social
utopias were dreams that turned into nightmares. The
television urged us to go back to "The Happy Days" of the
apolitical 50s. The message was, get a job, and go back to
church.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn12">12</a>]</span> The unyielding nuclear threat generated only
nihilism and hopelessness. There was no answer but death,
no exit from the grisly future. The new ethic was personal
success, aerobics, material consumption, a return to
"American values," and the "moral majority" white Christian
world.  The official message was clear.

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
But Just Suppose 
<br>
It Didn't Happen That Way...
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
The headlines the day of the massacre read: "Cult Dies
in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee
into Jungle."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn13">13</a>]</span> By all accounts in the press, as well as
People's Temple statements there were at least 1,100 people
at Jonestown.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn14">14</a>]</span> There were 809 adult passports found
there, and reports of 300 children (276 found among the
dead, and 210 never identified). The headline figures from
the first day add to the same number: 1,100.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn15">15</a>]</span>
The original body count done by the Guyanese was 408, and this figure
was initially agreed to by U.S. Army authorities on
site.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn16">16</a>]</span>
However, over the next few days, the total of reported dead began to
rise quickly. The Army made a series of misleading and openly false
statements about the discrepancy. The new total, which was the official
final count, was given almost a week later by American authorities as
913.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn17">17</a>]</span>
A total of 16 survivors were reported to have returned to the
U.S.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn18">18</a>]</span> Where were the others?

</p><p>
At their first press conference, the Americans claimed
that the Guyanese "could not count." These local people had
carried out the gruesome job of counting the bodies, and
later assisted American troops in the process of poking
holes in the flesh lest they explode from the gasses of
decay.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn19">19</a>]</span> Then the Americans proposed another theory --
they had missed seeing a pile of bodies at the back of the
pavilion. The structure was the size of a small house, and
they had been at the scene for days.  Finally, we were
given the official reason for the discrepancy -- bodies had
fallen on top of other bodies, adults covering
children.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn20">20</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It was a simple, if morbid, arithmetic that led to the
first suspicions. The 408 bodies discovered at first count
would have to be able to cover 505 bodies for a total of
913. In addition, those who first worked on the bodies
would have been unlikely to miss bodies lying beneath each
other since each body had to be punctured. Eighty-two of
the bodies first found were those of children, reducing the
number that could have been hidden below others.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn21">21</a>]</span> A
search of nearly 150 photographs, aerial and close-up,
fails to show even one body lying under another, much less
500.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn22">22</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It seemed the first reports were true, 400 had died,
and 700 had fled to the jungle. The American authorities
claimed to have searched for people who had escaped, but
found no evidence of any in the surrounding area.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn23">23</a>]</span> At
least a hundred Guyanese troops were among the first to
arrive, and they were ordered to search the jungle for
survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn24">24</a>]</span> In the area, at the same time, British Black
Watch troops were on "training exercises," with nearly 600
of their best-trained commandos. Soon, American Green
Berets were on site as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn25">25</a>]</span> The presence of these
soldiers, specially trained in covert killing operations,
may explain the increasing numbers of bodies that
appeared.

</p><p>
Most of the photographs show the bodies in neat rows,
face down. There are few exceptions. Close shots indicate
drag marks, as though the bodies were positioned by someone
after death.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn26">26</a>]</span> Is it possible that the 700 who fled were
rounded up by these troops, brought back to Jonestown and
added to the body count?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn27">27</a>]</span>

</p><p>
If so, the bodies would indicate the cause of death. A
new word was coined by the media, "suicide-murder." But
which was it?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn28">28</a>]</span> Autopsies and forensic science are a
developing art. The detectives of death use a variety of
scientific methods and clues to determine how people die,
when they expire, and the specific cause of death. Dr.
Mootoo, the top Guyanese pathologist, was at Jonestown
within hours after the massacre. Refusing the assistance of
U.S. pathologists, he accompanied the teams that counted
the dead, examined the bodies, and worked to identify the
deceased. While the American press screamed about the
"Kool-Aid Suicides," Dr. Mootoo was reaching a much
different opinion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn29">29</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are certain signs that show the types of poisons
that lead to the end of life. Cyanide blocks the messages
from the brain to the muscles by changing body chemistry in
the central nervous system. Even the "involuntary"
functions like breathing and heartbeat get mixed neural
signals. It is a painful death, breath coming in spurts.
The other muscles spasm, limbs twist and contort. The
facial muscles draw back into a deadly grin, called
"cyanide rictus."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn30">30</a>]</span> All these telling signs were absent
in the Jonestown dead. Limbs were limp and relaxed, and the
few visible faces showed no sign of distortion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn31">31</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Instead, Dr. Mootoo found fresh needle marks at the
back of the left shoulder blades of 80-90% of the
victims.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn32">32</a>]</span> Others had been shot or strangled. One
survivor reported that those who resisted were forced by
armed guards.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn33">33</a>]</span> The gun that reportedly shot Jim Jones
was lying nearly 200 feet from his body, not a likely
suicide weapon.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn34">34</a>]</span> As Chief Medical Examiner, Mootoo's
testimony to the Guyanese grand jury investigating
Jonestown led to their conclusion that all but three of the
people were murdered by "persons unknown." Only two had
committed suicide they said.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn35">35</a>]</span> Several pictures show the
gun-shot wounds on the bodies as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn36">36</a>]</span> The U.S. Army
spokesman, Lt. Col. Schuler, said, "No autopsies are
needed. The cause of death is not an issue here." The
forensic doctors who later did autopsies at Dover,
Delaware, were never made aware of Dr. Mootoo's
findings.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn37">37</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are other indications that the Guyanese
government participated with American authorities in a
cover-up of the real story, despite their own findings. One
good example was Guyanese Police Chief Lloyd Barker, who
interfered with investigations, helped "recover" 2.5
million for the Guyanese government, and was often the
first to officially announce the cover stories relating to
suicide, body counts and survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn38">38</a>]</span> Among the first to
the scene were the wife of Guyanese Prime …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I thought <a href="https://dev.to/blarzhernandez/just-keep-coding-a-letter-to-junior-developers-21h8">this article</a> was worth sharing, as it is a relatively inexperienced developer talking to newer devs. But as I read it, one piece of advice stuck out and is worth emphasizing.</p>



<blockquote><p>Plan first, then code</p><cite> Roberto Hernandez</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is fundamental. Unlike, say carpentry, where planning is critical because you waste material if you don’t, coding sometimes feels like you can “just start.” After all, if you make a mistake, you can delete the code and start over (as long as you’re operating on your own development environment, not production). Seeing what you’re building is satisfying, both to you as a builder and anyone else you share your work with.</p>



<p>However, “just starting” is a recipe for waste, if what you start is writing code. </p>



<p>The first thing you should do before writing a single line of code is understand the problem. Depending on the size and scale of the problem, confirming this understanding could be as simple as repeating the request back to the person who made it: “so what you are saying is you want me to change the button text to blue” and thinking through the ramifications: “that will work on form A and B, but what about form C?”. </p>



<p>Or it could be as complicated as writing up a specifications document with the proposed changes and architecture, getting feedback on it, running it by the appropriate people or committees, and getting sign-off from stakeholders, including executives and customers.</p>



<p>Then, after you confirm you understand the problem and proposed solution, plan on how you are going to execute against it. For a small problem, this could involve starting immediately by writing or thinking of a list of tasks to do, though often you’ll want to add it to a todo list or calendar to ensure this task isn’t lost among the sea of other tasks you have. For a larger problem, there may be cross team coordination required, so: meetings and documents. </p>



<p>After you understand the problem and have a plan for how to accomplish this goal, you can begin writing code.</p>



<p>Avoid jumping in and writing code because the time to feedback is long. Compared to what? Compared to text, images or meetings. These are so much easier to iterate. If you write some code to solve the wrong problem or address it in the wrong manner, you’ve used more time than you would have if you’d talked through the problem.</p>



<p>It is also harder to communicate concepts with code, especially with non technical colleagues. Even with fellow engineers, a diagram or conversation is an easier way to explain ideas than written code. I’ve often whiteboarded a solution in a fraction of the time it would have taken to prototype it. Code is more precise and you can’t handwave a problem away, but there’s lots of chaff around the germ of the idea in many code bases. </p>



<p>There are times when writing code is the right way to start, though. This is called prototyping and if there’s no way to gain an understanding of the problem by reading, learning, discussing or otherwise approaching it, write some code to explore it. However, be prepared to throw this code away, as it will be the equivalent of a hastily scratched note on a napkin.</p>



<p>I do want to emphasize that this understanding and planning process doesn’t always have to be heavyweight and formal. In fact, for smaller tasks, you may internalize this process and not even realize you are doing it. </p>



<p>Next time you are working on a small task, take a moment and think about how you break it up into even smaller bits of work: “ok, I need to add this form. Therefore I need a model and a view too, and what are the methods I should add to validate the input?” </p>



<p>You don’t need to produce documentation and artifacts for every decision, but you would do well to at least in your own head think through the tasks and the ramifications of those tasks. This will help you <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/09/16/learn-to-look-around-corners/">look around corners</a> and see issues that may arise because of your solution. If you do, you can modify the solution, again, before any code is written. </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you have any questions for the MulticoreWare team, please get in touch with Shivakumar Narayanan at <a aria-label="x266@multicorewareinc.com (opens in a new tab)" href="mailto:x266@multicorewareinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">x266@multicorewareinc.com</a>.</p>



<p>Also, many thanks to <a aria-label="Praveen Kumar Karadugattu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenkpk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Praveen Kumar Karadugattu</a>, Video Architect at MulticoreWare for kicking off this discussion between MulticoreWare and OTTVerse.com. </p>

October 19, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better onboarding retention, get users to add value to your product as quickly as possible.</p><p>How?</p><h2>1. Create shortcuts to show only the relevant information (screen by preferences).</h2><p>Spotify asks users to select their favorite artists instead of going to dashboard:</p><figure id="w-node-213b4e788a3d-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8809c116cb645d12bb4594_spotify-onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are a SaaS&nbsp;company that sells form building software, you could for example, ask what type of form the person is looking to create, then based on that selection provide an appropriate form template. This helps the user accomplish their task more quickly and they are more likely to stick with you after they've seen the value of your product.</p><h2>2. Take out unnecessary steps or save them for after the user has added value.</h2><p>SproutSocial does this well by instantly prompting to connect to social media accounts FIRST, and only then asking for additional information.</p><figure id="w-node-7da55c5c0f57-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880ef541456e5a30b5034b_SproutSocial%20Additional%20Connections.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>First the user is asked to connect their social profiles (this instantly populates their dashboard with valuable insights)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-ac84d3ff6921-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880272ff20a95ceb04363c_sproutsocial.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Then the user is asked to answer some questions that will help SproutSocial segment their audience. Notice how there were no massive forms to fill out - this is key.</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Try checklists which encourage user to take small steps to engage with your product or add their own value.</h2><p>There are all sorts of ways to present this (header notice, widget, embedded, welcome email)</p><figure id="w-node-ef9c31814aa4-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88028112b0af3c3a1e504b_checklist.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Gamify with progression. Start them off with some steps already completed.</h2><p>If you are already using a checklist in your app's dashboard, you can start them off with some progress already made so that the user doesn't feel like they are starting from zero. </p><p>For example, you can cross off an item they've already completed (see above screenshot). </p><p>You could start them off at 20% instead of 0% when it comes to completing various steps to get to the "aha" moment of your product.</p><p>In multi-step onboarding you could visually indicate that the first step is already finished (presumably the 1st click to the form).</p><h2>5. Assist with templates - so user only has to modify contents.</h2><p><a href="http://pory.io/">Pory.io</a> is great at this. Instead of just dropping you off to let you figure out the tool on your own, they provide you with starting templates.</p><figure id="w-node-129cbdb09480-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802a8b78d93b942995c83_Pory.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If templates do not apply, you could add placeholder content so people know how to edit and where to start. Templates are a great way to get people to skip all the busy work of starting from scratch and provide a semi-finished starting point. </p><p>Canva does an excellent job by allowing people to select an asset they wish to create, and present fully-designed examples that only require some tweaking.</p><h2>6. If integrating with other tools, show personalized how-to videos specific to the integration.</h2><p>Most SaaS&nbsp;companies add their integration instructions in support documents. If the user has to leave your dashboard and hunt down support docs, they could just as easily go do something else. </p><p>By providing relevant integration videos within the dashboard, you keep the user engaged and more likely to finish the setup.</p><p>Memberstack provides a handy Webflow integration tutorial for people who are building in Webflow.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b21132cc9f9c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802dd24f28319c733480d_memberstack.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. Try adding integrations into the onboarding flow after they've already created an account</h2><p>If your tool or app integrates with other popular platforms, consider adding those integrations into the onboarding flow. </p><p>You often see companies have an "integrations" tab or section in their app, but very few add those to onboarding. </p><p>We can bypass the standard behavior and ask the user to integrate with a popular tool in a multi-step onboarding process. They have the option to skip, but once they add a one or two click connection, they are more likely to get hooked or have a chance to expose your product to everyone at their company.</p><h2>8. Reward with points and prizes if appropriate.</h2><p>Duolingo gives users virtual "lingots" which encourage user to keep going in order to collect enough to spend them.</p><figure id="w-node-ef0778b73aac-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803008701da7f3ec23ae7_duolingo-lingots.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. Provide the benefit of your product first, then ask user to create an account to save their work</h2><p><a href="http://priar.io/">Priar.io</a> does this by letting you preview their product with YOUR content before hitting "Generate link" to create an account.</p><figure id="w-node-6eeed1f77289-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88032af52d301ff3d87f39_piar.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. If product benefits from multiple people using it, prompt user to invite those people.</h2><p>BetterUptime prompts you to invite your colleagues as additional users:</p><figure id="w-node-3a1237c05f92-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88034b16cb640d52bb33e6_better-uptime.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. Gift them with an upgraded version of their selected price tier, or gift full access.</h2><p>Netflix does this well by offering a free upgrade at the time of the trial.</p><figure id="w-node-ecd982c93506-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803bff7e683308565cef1_41.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div>]]>

            <p>We have <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/oculus-facebook-account-requirement-is-here/">previously reported</a> that the Oculus Quest 2 requires a Facebook account when setting it up. Now users are reporting that their accounts are being locked or banned by the social media giant’s verification system.</p><p>Users who do not have Facebook accounts or have to reactivate long dormant ones are reporting issues that cause instant suspensions.

                <div><p>Ants are one of the most successful groups of animals on the planet, occupying anywhere from temperate soil to tropical rainforests, desert dunes and kitchen counters. They’re social insects and their team-working abilities have long since been identified as one of the key factors leading to their success. Ants are famously able to lift or drag objects many times their own weight and transport these objects back to their colony. But with previous research having focused on the social aspects of an ant colony, looking at an individual ant has been somewhat neglected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and Sorbonne University in Paris have investigated why individual worker ants are so strong by taking X-ray images and creating 3D models of their thorax – the central unit of their bodies – to analyze their muscles and internal skeleton. <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-020-00375-9" target="_blank">Their study, published in<em> Frontiers in Zoology</em></a>, examines the hypothesis that loss of flight in worker ants is directly connected to the evolution of greater strength.</p>

<p>“Worker ants evolved from flying insects,” said Professor Evan Economo, who leads OIST’s <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/bbu" target="_blank">Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit</a>. “We’ve always assumed that losing flight helped to optimize their bodies for working on the ground, but we have much to learn about how this is achieved.”</p>

<p>Being able to fly might be a common dream amongst people but the reality of flight is that it puts strong constraints on the build of a body. In flying insects, the wing muscles occupy a major part of the thorax – sometimes more than 50%. This means that other muscles, which are used to support and move the head, legs, and abdomen are constrained and squeezed up against the exoskeleton.</p>

<p>But once the constraints of flight are removed, all that space in the thorax is open, which, the researchers surmised, would allow the remaining muscles to expand and reorganize.</p>

<p>Previous research in this area had focused on the external structure of ants but, with the technology available at OIST, the researchers were able to gain a highly detailed picture of what was going on inside the thorax. The aim was to analyze the general features common across all ants, rather than focus on the specialization of certain species. To do this, the researchers did a detailed analysis of two distantly related ant species, including both the wingless workers and the flying queens, and confirmed their findings across a broader sample of species.</p>

<p>They used advanced X-ray technology to scan the internal and external anatomy, like CT scans used in a hospital, but at much higher resolution. From these scans, the researchers mapped all the different muscles and modeled them in 3D. The result was a comprehensive image of the inside of the thorax. They then compared findings from these two species to a range of other ants and wingless insects.</p>

<p>As predicted, the researchers found that loss of flight had allowed for clear-cut reorganization of the thorax. “Within the worker ant’s thorax, everything is integrated beautifully in a tiny space,” said the late Dr. Christian Peeters, lead author of this paper, who was a research professor at Sorbonne University. “The three muscle groups have all expanded in volume, giving the worker ants more strength and power. There has also been a change in the geometry of the neck muscles, which support and move the head. And the internal attachment of muscles has been modified.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, when looking at wingless wasps, the researchers found that these insects had responded to the loss of flight in a completely different way. Wingless wasps are solitary and consume food as they find it. On the other hand, ants are part of a colony. They hunt or scavenge for food that then needs to be carried back to the nest for the queen and younger nestmates, so it makes sense that there was a selection pressure to promote carrying ability.</p>

<p>Ants have been studied for centuries in terms of their behavior, ecology, and genetics but, the researchers emphasized, this story of strength has, so far, been somewhat overlooked. The next step is to develop more detailed biomechanical models of how different muscle groups function, do similar research on the mandible and legs, and explore the diversity seen between ant species.</p>

<p>“We’re interested in what makes an ant an ant and understanding the key innovations behind their success” explained Professor Economo. “We know that one factor is the social structure, but this individual strength is another essential factor."</p>

<p>Alongside Professor Economo and Dr. Peeters, the research group included Dr. Roberto A. Keller from University of Lisbon and OIST, Mr. Adam Khalife from Sorbonne University and OIST, Dr. Georg Fischer and Mr. Julian Katzke from OIST, and Dr. Alexander Blanke from University of Cologne.</p>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRO</a></h2>

<p>The vast majority of people on earth argue in a <em>destructive </em>fashion. Debates, especially in online spaces, are viewed as a battle of the wits in which egos are put on display and there can be only one "winner".</p>

<p>Instead, we should be arguing in a <em>constructive </em>fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I used to be a destructive arguer. When I was younger, my goal in any argument was not to learn something new, but rather to assure my superiority over what I felt to be the clear stupidity of the other side. I even used to save screenshots of debates I had on various forums and social media platforms, returning periodically to reminisce about past skirmishes in which I "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigger-the-libs">owned the conservatives</a>".</p>

<p>Luckily, several years spent abroad gave me a different perspective. I realized that in the small-sided debates I used to engage in back home, my positions lacked the nuance and context of the greater world. For the first time, I began to do deep research on how to think — and argue — &nbsp;more clearly, drawing from concepts from philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>This widened outlook led me to see arguments as a chance to build value, rather than destroy it. Instead of going through the mental anguish of battle, I now follow a collaborative approach to debate that I'd like to share in this guide in hopes that it will inspire others to argue more constructively.</p>

<p>Note that the content in this guide will focus on arguments about public issues, like politics and religion, as opposed to personal issues, like "you need to communicate more" or "you haven't done the dishes in weeks". Though there is overlap between the two, interpersonal arguments are much more complex and require more nuance than this guide can provide, plus there are already a ton of great resources out there that explore these topics more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="mindset">MINDSET</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span><em>&nbsp;"An argument should be a collaboration between two people to find the truth."</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to distill this guide down to one sentence, it would be the above. Even if you forget the individual tenets and strategies this guide has to offer, as long as you are treating any given argument as a collaboration in search of truth, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Arguing more effectively requires detaching yourself from the idea of "winning" in the traditional sense. Instead, you should declare victory when you have argued in good faith and kept an open mind.</p>

<p>True collaboration requires that both parties open an investigation into why they may be wrong and consider changing their beliefs. Which brings us to the three core tenets of a constructive debate mindset:</p>

<h3>Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind <a href="#Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" id="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" name="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Was there ever a time in which you had a deeply-held belief about something, but slowly came to realize that you were wrong? Maybe you thought a past partner was "the one", or you were devoted to a religious faith. Or perhaps something as simple as believing in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>What's to say that couldn't happen with the other deeply-held beliefs, given enough evidence?</p>

<p>Go into every debate with the mindset that you may not know everything about the topic at hand, and in fact <em>may be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you successfully acknowledge that you may be wrong, it follows that you must then be willing to change your mind. Having the humility to admit that your mind has been changed is one of the most honorable positions in a good faith debate.</p>

<h3>Arguments Are Not Soldiers <a href="#Arguments Are Not Soldiers" id="Arguments Are Not Soldiers" name="Arguments Are Not Soldiers"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In a war, all soldiers take an oath to fight for their own side, no matter what amount they agree with its principles. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">Eliezer Yudkowsky once observed</a> that in political debates, arguments were treated like soldiers: "<em>Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.</em>"</p>

<p>Because most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that <em>their</em><em> side</em> supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.</p>

<p>The red state gun-owner must be pro-religion, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, anti-tax, and skeptical of gender issues.</p>

<p>The blue state Subaru-owner must be anti-religion, pro-abortion, pro-drugs, pro-tax(ing-the-rich), and concerned about gender issues.</p>

<p>Most annoying is that given the societal expectations for this divide, being for or against one issue immediately assigns you to a "side" in the views of everyone involved. Breaking out of this Arguments as Soldiers mindset involves two steps:</p>

<p>1. Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable (better yet, try not to have a side).</p>

<p>2. On the flip side, avoid stereotyping your debate partner based on one opinion. If you are engaging with someone in debate for the first time, assume that they agree with you on every other position than the one they are defending, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil <a href="#There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" id="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" name="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p><em>Brace yourself, Star Wars references incoming:</em></p>

<p>In a given debate, almost everyone thinks they are a member of the Jedi order, fighting for all that is virtuous and good in the universe. Yet for every Jedi, there's a Sith out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llLKar19XhA">who thinks that the Jedi are evil</a> and wrong and that <em>they</em> are actually the ones fighting for virtue and good. Remember that this person might even be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not a full agent of good, and your debate partner is not an agent of evil, or vice versa. You are simply citizens of the galaxy who happen to be operating with different sets of information. Look at the situation from a different perspective: if you were raised with Sith beliefs from childhood, don't you think you might believe the exact same things a Sith would?</p>

<p>In debate, your goal should not be to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNKwZTv1d0">strike down the side of evil with all your hatred</a>, but rather work together with them to uncover the true facts about the universe, and in doing so perhaps change both your perspectives.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="prework">PRE-WORK</a></h2>

<p>It would be great if choosing to pursue the path of arguing constructively was just a matter of changing your mindset overnight, but as Carl Sagan once said: <a href="https://youtu.be/BkHCO8f2TWs?t=9">"If you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</a></p>

<p>In the same vein, if you wish to improve the constructiveness of the debates you engage in, you must first spend time re-inventing your entire mind.</p>

<p>This is because our mind is constantly working against us, plagued by ancient errors from the times in which we lived in caves and hunted woolly mammoths. These errors work against us in the form of cognitive biases and logical fallacies, which hinder our ability to clearly see reality and engage in sound debate.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" id="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" name="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.</p>

<p>Common examples that relate to debates are <em>confirmation bias</em>, or the tendency of humans to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs, and <em>ingroup bias</em>, or the tendency to agree more strongly with people that appear to be part of our "tribe", but there are over 100 identified biases, and it's worth reading through the Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">most common cognitive biases</a> so you can recognize when they might be clouding your thinking.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" id="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" name="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In part caused by cognitive biases, logical fallacies are errors in argument that give off an air of decisiveness, despite making points that don't hold up to logical scrutiny. While these are often used unintentionally, due to bias, carelessness, or ignorance, unfortunately, they can also be wielded intentionally by a shrewd debate partner.</p>

<p>Common examples in debate include the <em>false dilemma fallacy</em>: "you're either with us or against us", and the <em>slippery slope fallacy</em>: "if we allow the gays to marry, what's next: plants?" Just like cognitive biases, there are a large number of identified logical fallacies, and it's worth it to review the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">entire list</a>, so you can spot them in your own arguments and in those of others.</p>

<h2><a id="debatebreakdown" name="debatebreakdown">BREAKING DOWN A DEBATE</a></h2>

<p>To the untrained eye, a debate might look like two or more parties trading argumentative points back and forth. But interestingly, these points can almost perfectly be classified into a few categories. Understanding these categories, and why some types of arguments are better than others, is crucial for learning how we and those whom we engage with in debate might shape their points. In a brilliant post called <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">Varieties of Argumentative Experience</a></em>, Scott Alexander does just this, illuminating and labeling practically every part of a debate. The post itself is basically required reading, but is long-ish<em>,</em> so I will summarize here.</p>

<p>Think of a debate as a pyramid: <a href="#debatepyramid" id="debatepyramid" name="debatepyramid"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></p>

<p><img alt="" height="548" src="http://liamrosen.com/Pyramid%20of%20Argumentative%20Experience.svg" width="978"></p>

<p>In general, the lower on the pyramid you are, the worse debate you're having. The goal should be to start as high as possible and continue to work your way towards the top.</p>

<p>Debates on twitter and other forms of social media are almost guaranteed to never rise above the lower dotted line, as these platform don't allow for more nuanced debate. Everything above the higher dotted line is our gold standard: two intelligent, charitable, and versed debaters can successfully maintain a debate at this level until some form of resolution.</p>

The researchers compared the apps’ predictions of when buses would arrive to actual arrival times. &nbsp;They then calculated how long commuters would wait at a stop if they used different tactics to time their arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Relying on the bus app garnered the worst results</h2><p>The absolute worst way to catch the bus was to use use what the researchers called the “greedy tactic,” which is the one used by many transit apps. This is where commuters time their arrival at the stop based on when the app says the bus will arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>People who followed this strategy were likely to miss the bus about three-fourths of the time, the study showed.&nbsp;</p><p>“The greedy tactic in common transit apps is the worst strategy,” the authors write, “even worse than showing up at a bus stop arbitrarily.”</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3maYDx8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Commuters</a> achieved slightly better results by using the app, but adding some extra time as an insurance buffer.

And these apps generally don’t check the buses’ location often enough to get accurate real-time information.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why long waiting times matter</h2><p>Waiting time for buses is an important issue, the authors said. Commuters cite long waiting times as one of the top reasons for not using public transportation.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a safety concern for people to not have to wait for long periods, especially at night. And having people rushing through busy streets because they are late for a bus is also unsafe.&nbsp; Furthermore, for many people, missing buses can jeopardize their jobs or important health care appointments.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors said that said the bus apps could be more helpful by taking advantage of the data used in this study to make better recommendations.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856420307229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does real-time transit information reduce waiting time?

    <li>You're all calculating churn rates wrong</li>
</ol>

        

        
        <p>
            Many smart people will tell you to obsess over your churn rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/churn_rate_formula2.png" alt="churn rate=(customers lost in month)/(customers at start of month)">
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Andreessen Horowitz, this number is <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/">one of the top 16 metrics</a>
            to measure a SaaS startup by. Well, sorry Andreessen, and sorry Horowitz, but this just isn't right.
        </p><p>
            It's counterintuitive, but it's a statistical fact: This number actually <b>tells you nothing useful about churn</b>,
            but really relates to the age of the subscriptions you have.
            It will in most cases go down on it's own, and, absurdly, the only way to keep it from going down is to have very
            high growth. So the number will literally <b>only look <i>bad</i> if your business is doing extremely <i>well</i></b>,
            and optimizing for it will be directly counter-productive.
            The error here is a simple statistical mistake that is easy to make, and luckily also easy to understand and avoid.
        </p><p>
            If you run a subscription based SaaS business, you're likely very concerned with how long you can keep your
            customers. We're a JavaScript exception tracking service, and the health of this business is fully determined by how many
            customers we bring in, and how long we can keep them. On the surface, <i>churn rate</i> may seem like a natural proxy for changes
            in <i>customer lifetimes</i>. Let's dig into why that is not true.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The false assumption
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computing a churn rate <b>assumes that a customer is equally likely to leave at any time</b>, no matter how long they've
            been subscribed to you. This is almost certainly not true. In fact, as we will see, having a constant churn probability over time
            essentially implies that you'll <i>never have long term customers</i>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/expon.png" alt="Hazard function (churn) and the implied survival function (from an Exponential distribution)">
            <figcaption>If a user has a constant churn probability over time, this implies that customer lifetimes come from an Exponential distribution.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If you have a constant churn of <code>c</code> per month, the probability that a customer stays subscribed for <code>n</code> months is <code>(1-c)^n</code>. This implies that customer lifetimes come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">Geometric distribution</a>. If customers can quit the subscription at any time, we have continuous time and should use the continuous time analogue, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">Exponential distribution</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from K. S. Lomax
        </h2>
        <p>
            The problem is, your customer is not equally likely to cancel their subscription at any time. Most likely, you have a situation where the drop-off in customers is higher in the first few days than it is later. This is even more so if you have a free trial period for your product.
        </p><p>
            If the churn probability gets lower the longer the customer has been subscribed, you could model that as <code>c/(t+1)</code>, where
            <code>t</code> is the timestep (e.g. number of days the customer has been subscribed), and <code>c</code> is some constant.
            In this case, this implies that customer lifetimes comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomax_distribution">Lomax distribution</a>.
            This is equivalent to a Pareto distribution shifted to start at 0.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/lomax.png" alt="Hazard function (churn) and the implied survival function (from a Lomax distribution)">
            <figcaption>The Lomax distribution can express churn probabilities that get lower with time.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from Waloddi Weibull
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you suspect that churn probability per day may <i>increase</i> the longer a user has been subscribed, the Lomax distribution won't
            work for you. Instead you could enlist the help of Swedish statistician Waloddi Weibull.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution">Weibull distribution</a> can express both decreasing,
            flat, and increasing probabilities of a customer quitting. This makes it a popular choice for modeling customer lifetimes.

            Optimizing for a falsehood will lead you astray
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now let's see why properly modeling this is important.
        </p><p>
            Let's measure churn the wrong way, and see where it takes us.
            Let's say customer lifetimes come from a Lomax distribution. Let's also say you have a business that is in terrible shape, where
            the number of new sign ups per day is falling by one per day. How will this look on the churn rate? We can simulate it and find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, in each of the examples below we simulate lifetimes from the same customer lifetime distribution,
            and this distribution <b>does not change</b> over time.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/shrinking_business.png" alt="Shrinking business, churn appears to fall">
            <figcaption>With a shrinking business, churn appears to improve because subscriptions are getting fewer and older.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            This is clearly a dying business, yet the churn rate graph is looking great! <b>
                The churn rate per day is falling steadily,
                even if we know that there is no change in customer lifetimes in our model.
            </b>
        </p><p>
            So what's going on? This sharp fall in churn rate is a consequence of the fact that we're not getting new customers.
            Because we're not growing, a bigger share of our customers have been around for a long time, which
            means they're less likely to churn, which means our daily churn graph goes down more than it would otherwise.
            This change on the population level happens despite there being no change in underlying individual customer lifetimes.
        </p><p>
            Let's change this into a scenario where your business is experiencing insane growth. We'll keep the customer lifetimes exactly the same,
            but change it so that the number of new sign ups per day is growing superlinearly.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/growing_business.png" alt="Growing business, churn appears to be flat">
            <figcaption>With a growing business, churn rate appears to not change, only because most subscriptions are new.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Even if the customer lifetimes are unchanged from before, the churn rate graph here is flat. An investor would frown and say
            we're doing nothing to improve how well we retain our customers. In reality, the only reason the graph looks "bad" has nothing to
            do with churn, it is because we're doing insanely well at getting new sign ups.
        </p><p>
            <b>
                If you are steering yourself and your team on the basis of this metric, you're rewarding yourself for stifling growth
                and punishing yourself for growing.
            </b> Obviously, this is 100% counterproductive.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How the h*** do we measure churn then?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As you might have guessed from the previous paragraphs, we should model the <i>distribution of customer lifetimes</i>,
            and we should do it in a <i>statistically sound way</i>. Lomax and Weibull distributions are good choices of model.
        </p><p>
            The part where this gets tricky is that we'll have two types of data: The customers that have quit, and the customers
            that are still subscribed. It's only our ex-customers that give us a total lifetime to work with. For our still-subscribed
            customers, we only know that their subscription has lasted up until now, and we don't know how much longer it will last
            into the future. In statistical lingo, we have what is called <i>right-censored data</i>.
        </p><p>
            Luckily there's a way to use all our data, even from our still-subscribed customers.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Weibull or Lomax?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Choosing between Weibull or Lomax (or any other distribution) has no simple answer. Weibull is more flexible
            in that it can express growing, shrinking and flat churn probabilities. However, this expressive power will
            not help you if your data is fundamentally Lomax-like. First and foremost, base your choice
            on your knowledge of the business that you're in. If you have any prior knowledge about how churn probabilities
            will develop, base your choice of distribution on that. There are also various
            <a href="https://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue71/relbasics71.htm">goodness of fit</a> tests you could use to
            inform this decision. The truth is, any choice of distribution will be wrong to some degree, so you need to make
            a judgment call as to what fits your situation the best, based both on both your data and your prior knowledge.
            For the purposes of the rest of this post, we'll just fit both distributions and disregard the question of
            which suits us the best.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Let's do some proper statistics
        </h2>
        <p>
            The probability distributions we'll model are defined by their parameters.
            We want to find the parameters that fit the data best. To start, we want to make a guess at these parameters,
            and have a way to tell how good our guess was. Luckily, we have a statistically sound way of knowing how good a guess
            is given the data we have. Extra luckily, this is also true when we have censored data.
            This function that tells us how likely our parameters are given the data we have is called the Likelihood function.
            We get it by looking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function</a>
            value for the uncensored data points and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function">survival function</a> value
            for each of the censored data points, and multiplying all these values together.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>“Computers are all made out of logic gates”. We’ve heard that saying before. We also have a sense that logic gates are very simple machines, analogous to light switches even. This raises the question: <em>how exactly do kind-of-light-switches come together to form computers</em>? How does “storing a variable” or “calling a function” translate into logic gates going on or off? </p><p>On a journey to answer that question, I discovered J Clark Scott’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" target="_blank">“How do It Know?</a>”. He starts with NAND gates and takes you on a journey to build a computer using them.</p><p>I liked his book so much that I took his schematic for RAM, and simulated it in Clojure. In this essay, I’ll guide you through doing just that: we’ll simulate NAND gates, and use about <em>14 thousand</em> of them to build 256 bytes of RAM.</p><p>Going through this simulation ingrained an “aha” feeling in me: watching 14 thousand little machines chug away makes you feel that whoever uses a computer is a wizard. A wizard with an army of millions of machine servants doing billions of little jobs for them every second. I hope it gives you the same feeling. 🙂</p><p>To grok this essay, you need to understand this picture:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NDk4LTdhY2RkMzgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi04NWQ2LTZmOWEzNGE2NmU5Zi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This describes a NAND gate. A NAND gate is a machine that has two input wires. If both input wires have a “high” charge (represented as 1), the output charge is “low” (represented as zero). With any other combination of input charges, the output charge is high.</p><p>Notice that the wires carry a charge, but we choose to interpret <em>meaning</em> in the charge. “high charge” means 1, and “low charge” means 0. Nothing changes in the machine, this is just something we decided as humans (1).</p><p>On the left you see a circuit diagram. You can read it as input wires <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> carrying charges into the <code>NAND</code> gate. The <code>NAND</code> gate has a wire <code>c</code>, carrying the output charge. For all the circuit diagrams we’ll draw, you can read them as electricity “flowing” from left to right, or top to bottom.</p><p>On the right is a “truth” table for a NAND gate. This is just a fancy name for summarizing every state a <code>NAND</code> gate can be, based on the input wires.</p><p>Now, we can start even lower than a <code>NAND gate</code>, but this machine is simple enough. It can’t be so hard to build something that turns off when two inputs are turned on. You don’t have to take my word for it though, you can search up “building a NAND gate with transistors”, and come back when you’re convinced. </p><p>Time to code! 🙂</p><p>First things first, we need some way to represent the state of our circuit. We know that our RAM will be built completely from <code>NAND</code> gates, so let’s take inspiration from one:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTI0LTg0NTczYjgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NWMyLWJlMWQ4MzFlNTg5MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If we look at this example we can see that:</p><ol><li>We have wires. </li><li>Wires have charges.</li><li>We hook wires together with NAND Gates</li></ol><p>Here’s one way we can map that to a data structure in Clojure: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-state-v0 {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>}</span>
<span>                  </span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> [{</span><span>:ins</span><span> [</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span>]</span>
<span>                                </span><span>:out</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span>}]})</span></code></pre><p>We can use keywords to represent our wires. We can also keep a map that tells us the charges of our wires. Finally, we can keep a list of NAND gates, which tell us how these wires connect. </p><p>Fine enough way to represent our circuit for now! Let’s create a few functions that can help us manage this representation:</p><pre><code><span>; update state v0</span>

Let’s try them out in the REPL:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>charges</span><span> (</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> empty-state</span>
<span>               (</span><span>set-charge</span><span> </span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>; =&gt; {:charge-map {}, :nand-gates [{:ins [:a :b], :out :c}]}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We can now “wire” up a circuit. Let’s run some electricity through it.</p><p>To figure out how to simulate electricity into our circuit, let’s remember our diagram again:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTU3LTk0NmYxYjAwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NGZkLTNlM2JkMzI5OWYwNC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>One way we can model this is to imagine that electricity is like water: It “flows” from sources into wires, and “triggers” all the devices that are connected to those wires.</p><p>With a model like that, here’s what would happen if a charge was “triggered” on <code>a</code>:</p><ol><li>First, <code>a</code>‘s charge would update. </li><li>After that <code>a</code> ‘s charge would transfer to all the NAND gates that are connected to it. In this case, it would be our one NAND gate above.</li><li>Each NAND gate would then recompute its charge, and if it changed, trigger its output wire in turn. In our case that’s <code>c</code> </li><li>If <code>c</code> was connected to other <code>NAND</code> gates, those gates would trigger, and the process would continue.</li></ol><p>Now, this is a very naive view of how electricity works (2), but it’s good enough for us to model RAM!</p><p>Let’s translate this into code.</p><p>To do that, we need a way to model what a <code>NAND</code> gate does:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> nand-output [a b]</span>

<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>nand-output</code> function takes two input charges, and produces the output charge that a <code>NAND</code> gate would produce.</p><p>Next, we need a function to find all the <code>NAND</code> gates that are connected to a specific wire:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> dependent-nand-gates [state wire]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>filter</span><span> </span>

A new framework for assessing urban food waste policies and initiatives, as well as their link to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that could be applied to any municipality.</p><p>Food waste is one of the most important issues of current food systems: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has estimated that more than one third of food is either lost or wasted along the entire food supply chain causing significant economic, social and environmental impacts. From an environmental point of view, food waste represents between 8% and 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the annual water footprint of the agricultural phase of food waste is about 250 km<sup>3</sup>, five times the volume of Lake Garda and higher than any national food consumption water footprint. The IPCC Special Report <i>Climate Change and Land</i> (2018) estimates that 37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to the food system considering its complete cycle, from agriculture and land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, consumption and waste. In the European Union (EU), 88 million tons of food waste are generated each year (i.e., 173 kg per capita) with significant economic, environmental and social impacts. It has been estimated that 15–16% of the total environmental impact of the food supply chain in Europe can be attributed to food waste.</p><p>Cities have emerged as crucial actors in the global food security geography: today they occupy approximately only 3% of the total land, but the number of people living in urban areas surpassed for the first time the number of people living in rural areas, and urban contexts are therefore the biggest source of post-consumption food waste, using between 70% and 80% of world’s food.<br>However, cities have proved to be crucial actors in tackling food waste, launching effective policies and initiatives to address it. By looking at 40 cities across 16 European countries, a study recently published on <i>Resources</i> – Special issue <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2Fjournal%2Fresources%2Fspecial_issues%2FFLW_management&amp;t=MzdiMTdlODQzMzEzZDhiMjUyNWE1NGVlMGU2NmJhNjI0NDcwZGYyZiw5dnBBZUtndg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632440031725912064%2Ffood-waste-and-cities&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603415803"><b>Food Loss and Waste: The Challenge of a Sustainable Management through a Circular Economy Perspective</b></a> presented a new framework for assessing urban food waste policies and initiatives.<br></p><p>“Food loss and waste is recognized as one of the most challenging distortion of current food system”, explains Marta Antonelli, senior scientist at the CMCC Foundation and Head of Research at Barilla Foundation. “We talk about <i>distortion </i>because we produce tons of edible food waste every year. <b>Food loss</b> occurs from farm up to and excluding retail, whilst <b>food waste</b> occurs at retail, food service and household level. Causes range from poor handling, inadequate transport or storage, lack of cold chain capacity, extreme weather conditions to cosmetic standards, and a lack of planning and cooking skills among consumers. This year we have witnessed an increase in food loss and waste as a result of movement and transport restrictions due to the pandemic. COVID-19 aside, each year about 14% of the world’s food is lost before even reaching the market.”<br></p><p>Reducing food lost or wasted means more food for all, less greenhouse gas emissions, less pressure on environment, especially on water and land resources, increased productivity and economic growth, and more sustainable societies.</p><p>“Food waste management is a very complex challenge” explains Marta Antonelli<b>,</b> “since it requires diversified but integrated actions that involve many public local authorities, such as cities, regions, metropolitan areas and provinces, and other actors including retailers, school canteens, hospitals, food markets, citizens and non-governmental organizations. All these actors and levels of governance need to work in a synergic way to ensure effective urban food waste policies.<br>Cities can have a crucial role acting on different sectors and levels of the urban food system. The City of Milan, for example, approved a waste tax deduction for actors that contribute to reducing food waste through donations. In particular, the City of Milan has explicitly declared its ambition to halve food waste by 2030 and its intention to adopt a food supply chain approach, in order to reduce food waste across all tiers of the chain from food production to final consumption.”<br>The authors started from a review of the most recent literature on food waste policy assessment frameworks and on urban food waste initiatives to capture the specificities of urban contexts and identify the most interesting urban initiatives and policies implemented. Finally, they identified direct and indirect links with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), showing the role that cities can play in achieving the targets of the UN 2030 Agenda. The framework proposed identifies and sheds light on the links between the different types of policies launched (information based, market based, regulatory, nudging initiatives, etc), the main areas of interventions addressed, as well as the different actors intervening in urban food waste management.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1502"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ca14c27484212fd3bf5463cfd1c059e6/ccac426ed9e27af9-02/s1280x1920/fe63c03280f61807a7b7544847f16f00b9a433db.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1502" width="1280" height="1335"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;

Cities are currently promoting new models of governance, for instance launching new institutional settings like the Food Policy Councils, creating regional and global networks of mayors advocating for more sustainable food systems, and coordinating initiatives to address food waste-related challenges in an integrated manner, from food production to food distribution.”<br></p><p>The study undermines the importance of providing city officials with effective tools to collect data on urban food waste levels, to understand the scope of the problem and design action. Gap in metrics and data are still many. Concrete metrics and publicly available quantification tools developed at city level are currently still missing.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="889"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/033be4f50ce7e39c8a343dac3b79b925/ccac426ed9e27af9-91/s1280x1920/a4c086288842ab5cf77d5742d3bba14455418d03.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="889" width="1280" height="790"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;

The research showed that cities seldom use the SDGs as a policy framework, thus limiting the evaluation of the impact of these interventions on the sustainability agenda.<br>Therefore, it is important to raise more awareness among local policy makers, public officials, the private sector, and citizens to fully monitor the link and the impact of food waste on the SDGs. Cities are implementing many urban food waste initiatives, but what it’s still rare is an integrated vision in addressing these issues In this sense, the recently adopted ‘Farm to Fork’ Strategy, part of the broader objective of making the EU food system the global standard for sustainability, represents the first step of the European Commission to address food system-related challenges in an integrated manner, for example putting human health and sustainability on the same level.”<br></p><p>The analysis could be easily expanded and replicated to other contexts, and in the future, the same framework could be valuable for other non-European cities that are starting to tackle food waste and are addressing similar challenges.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;

		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

			    	<p>Have you ever experienced your laptop fan becoming loud simply by viewing a web page? The most likely culprit are the ads on the page.</p>

<p>Magic Lasso Adblock blocks ads, privacy trackers and unnecessary JavaScript on web pages. By removing these items, pages are smaller and battery life sees a big improvement.</p>

<p>Having efficient, light and simple pages reduces a web browser’s energy use, including its’ use of the CPU and graphics processor. When there’s less to load, render and interpret, a web browser is faster and also uses less battery. Let’s take a closer look at how much an impact this can make.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-impacts-battery-life">What impacts battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ads are the most frequent user of battery life.</strong> Ads use a lot of network resources to load and also significantly use the CPU to display complex animations or video. Many web pages include multiple ads which reduces battery life further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although not as impactful as ads, <strong>tracking scripts also impact battery life.</strong> Many of these scripts are bloated; adding extra page weight and extra loading time. For no benefit to the user. Tracking scripts can also slow pages by recording usage as you interact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many web apps now use <strong>complex JavaScript frameworks</strong> that may impact battery life. Although necessary for an app to function, due to their use of non-native code they are not always efficient users of the CPU. Both web pages and some apps such as Microsoft Teams and Slack use JavaScript heavily, which quickly drains your device’s battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years, <strong>hidden crypto-mining scripts</strong> have been included on approximately 0.2% of all web pages. The majority of pages execute crypto-mining without user consent. <a name="how-many"></a>These scripts are especially heavy users of the CPU, slow down browsing and unnecessarily use battery life and energy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-many-unnecessary-ads-exist-on-common-pages">How many unnecessary ads exist on common pages?</h3>
<p>Advertisements and tracking scripts, like any other website element, adds page weight and loading time to web pages. Even once a page has loaded, many scripts are running constantly, increasing the ongoing energy use while you read page content.</p>

<p>On a popular website such as The Verge, these unnecessary elements add 4.96 MB of page weight to each and every page load.<a name="how-can-improve"></a></p>

<p><strong>That’s 62% of the total page weight spent on features that don’t assist you as a reader.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-improve-my-battery-life">How can I improve my battery life?</h3>
<p>The easiest way to remove all of these unnecessary elements is to use an ad blocker. By default, Magic Lasso Adblock removes all advertisements and tracking scripts. In addition, the Battery Boost feature blocks many heavy JavaScript frameworks and stops hidden background crypto-mining scripts.</p>

<p>To see how much of a difference this makes, we did some tests. You’ll see the results below.</p>

<p>Using a selection of random pages from the top News and Media websites in the US (as reported by SimilarWeb), we automated loading, viewing and scrolling of the page to replicate a normal user.</p>

<p>Then we recorded the time until 10% battery life remained, both with Magic Lasso enabled and disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/adblock-that-doubles-battery-life/browser-battery-life@2x.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Magic Lasso Adblock with Battery Boost reduced energy consumption by over 50%.</strong> <a name="what-else"></a>That gives you twice as much battery life to use your device on each charge when doing heavy web browsing.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-can-i-do-to-improve-web-browsing-battery-life">What else can I do to improve web browsing battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In Safari on the Mac, <strong>disable auto-playing videos</strong>. This reduces battery use while browsing on many sites that play videos automatically. Available in Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Auto-Play. If you want to view the video you can just tap to play instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Reader mode by default</strong> to make many news sites a more pleasant and lightweight experience. Safari includes a useful Reader mode which shows an article’s content and removes any distracting surrounding navigation and ads. It doesn’t work for all sites but is helpful for websites with articles that your read often. Enable this on the Mac in Safari Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Reader. In Safari on iOS, it can be set in the Address bar &gt; Aa &gt; Website Settings.</li>
  <li>When battery life is getting low on your iPhone or iPad, <strong>enable Low Battery mode.</strong> Available in the Control Centre and also in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Low Power Mode, this temporarily reduces any background activity which extends your battery until you can charge it.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Wifi.</strong> When Safari accesses data on an iPhone or iPad, a Wi-Fi connection uses less power than a mobile network. So keep Wi-Fi on at all times. To turn on, go to Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li>Finally, <strong>adjust your screen brightness.</strong> A bright screen uses a surprising amount of the overall battery of your device. <a name="try-magic-lasso"></a>Therefore you can dim the screen or turn on Auto-Brightness to extend battery life.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><em>A short tutorial on how to design a menu navigation toggle with only CSS</em></p>
        
        <p>When thinking through navigation designs for mobile devices sometimes the best option is to store away the content behind a toggle button. This button would then display the menu items upon interaction. Let me show you how to create such an element with only CSS - no need for JavaScript today!</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>

<p>I would like to point out that the concept of “toggling” the main menu (even for mobile) is not always the best solution. If you’re interested, you can take a look at a previous article I wrote explaining why: <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/hamburger-menu-alternative/">Using Hamburger Menus? Try Sausage Links</a></p>

<p>Now that we have mentioned possible pitfalls of relying so heavily on toggle menus, let’s build one!</p>

<h2 id="our-final-product">Our Final Product</h2>

<p data-height="372" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bradleytaunt" data-slug-hash="mdEEvEX" data-pen-title="Menu Toggle with Pure CSS">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt/pen/mdEEvEX">
  Menu Toggle with Pure CSS</a> by Bradley Taunt (<a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt">@bradleytaunt</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<h2 id="the-html">The HTML</h2>

<p>To implement this design you really don’t need much in terms of HTML:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single <code>checkbox</code> input</li>
  <li>A <code>label</code> that corresponds to the <code>checkbox</code></li>
  <li>A <code>nav</code> element to house our unordered list items</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- The checkbox input &amp; label partner --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>id=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>Menu<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;!-- The navigation we wish to toggle --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Home<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>About<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Articles<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Colophon<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Contact<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/nav&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h2 id="the-css">The CSS</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do is “hide” the <code>checkbox</code> input element. It’s important to avoid using <code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code> in order to achieve this. Those CSS properties can negatively impact accessibility (specifically screen readers). So we will be relying on the <code>position</code>, <code>z-index</code> and <code>opacity</code> properties to help us out.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set the input position to absolute, send it off screen with zero opacity */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>-9999px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then we give our corresponding <code>label</code> a minor face-lift to make it appear more button-like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Minor visual styling to make the label more button-y */</span>
<span>label</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>border</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>4px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> <span>pointer</span><span>;</span>
    <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>10px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For our main <code>nav</code> element, we want to set it’s position to <code>absolute</code> in order to avoid any janky page rendering issues that might occur when toggling the menu:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set nav to absolute (avoids odd page rendering space pop-in) */</span>
<span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>-2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last step is to actually <em>show</em> the menu if the user toggles the <code>checkbox</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Show nav when checkbox is checked */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span><span>:checked</span> <span>~</span> <span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It might not look like much, but you now have a fully functional menu toggle - <strong>made with pure CSS</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>

<p>Although this design is very simple to implement, please remember to use these types of menus wisely. Just because you <em>can</em> do something, doesn’t always mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

From the jet fuel and gasoline burned to transport the packages, to the cardboard boxes cluttering your house, the whole process is filled with reminders that your actions have tangible, permanent consequences.
Download that book onto an e-reader, however, and this trail of evidence seems to vanish.
The reality is, just as a package purchased on Amazon must be transported through warehouses and shipping centers to get to your home, a downloaded book must be transported from data centers and networks across the world to arrive on your screen.</p><div><div><div><div><div><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 278 44" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

    E-Book <span idyll="[object Object]"><b> →</b></span></p><p>It is difficult to ignore the environmental consequences of ordering a physical book on Amazon. But what happens when you download an E-Book instead?</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>And that’s the thing: your digital actions are only possible because of the physical infrastructure built to support them.
Digital actions are physical ones. This means that Google has to be mindful of sharks.
This also means that we should be mindful of the carbon emissions produced by running the world’s data centers and internet networks.
According to one study, <span>the Information and Communications Technology sector is expected to account for 3–3.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020</span> <a title="Assessing ICT global emissions footprint: Trends to 2040 &amp; recommendations, Lotfi Belkhir and Ahmed Elmelgi" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a>.
That’s more than the fuel emissions for all air travel in 2019, which clocked in at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/climate/air-travel-emissions.html" target="_blank">2.5%.</a>
The answer to “why?” and  “how?” may not be immediately obvious, but that’s not the fault of consumers.
A well-designed, frictionless digital experience means that users don’t <i>need</i> to worry about what happens behind the scenes and, by extension, the consequences.
This is problematic: the idea of “hidden costs” runs contrary to principles of environmental awareness.
Understanding how these digital products and services work is a crucial first step towards addressing their environmental impact.</p><p><span><span><div><hr><div><p>Get updates from the Parametric Press</p></div><hr></div></span></span></p><p>

When you listen to audio on your device, you generally load a version of the original audio file that has been compressed into a smaller size.

This means that in the one minute timespan that both audio files were played, roughly twice as much data needed to be loaded for “Old Town Road” than for “Digging into ‘American Dirt’”, which leads to the song having about twice as large of a carbon footprint.

In the chart, the number in front of the “p” for quality refers to the height, in pixels, of the video.

From the chart, it is clear that the “Old Town Road” music video has a higher bitrate than the 3Blue1Brown animation at both qualities. 
This difference could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the frame rate, compression algorithm, and the producers’ desired video fidelity.</p><p>In the examples provided, videos produced far more CO₂ than audio over the same time span.

Things are out of joint in the delta of the Mekong, Southeast Asia’s largest river. Rising sea levels and subsiding land are threatening to flood the area.</p><br><div><p>
Simultaneously, the annual Monsoon inundations are delayed more and more often, while still retreating early, and leaving local fields parched.</p><p>But why? Let’s unravel a complex tangle of reasons, with climate change at its core.</p></div><p>
Deltas have always been hubs of human development. Ancient civilizations flourished in the Nile and the Ganges deltas. Today, <a text="half a billion people" url="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news">half a billion people</a> call deltas home—even though they cover only 1% of the earth’s land surface. With rich crops and abundant fish, deltas are crucial to food security and economic development.</p><p>However, deltas are also extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Located at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, a delta’s entire existence depends on a delicate balance of factors: Temperature. Freshwater and saltwater. Precipitation and river flow.</p><p>In the Mekong delta, this balance has been disturbed. As a consequence, the delta of Southeast Asia’s largest river is both sinking and drying out at the same time. While ever-rising waves lap away at the coastline, and higher sea levels push salty water into the delta, severe droughts are leaving the landscape parched.</p><p>But what exactly causes this double threat? And what can be done about it?</p><p>The answers to these questions are as complex as the environmental and political problems casting their shadows over the region.</p><p>At the heart of the issue: Climate change.</p><h2 id="living-with-the-river">Living with the River</h2><p>Springing from the vast Tibetan plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, the Mekong river winds its way over 2,700 miles through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p></div><div><p>The Mekong River and its Delta</p><p>From the Tibetan plateau through six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam</p><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/sinking-delta/static/images/overview.png" idyll="[object Object]"></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Christina Orieschnig</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><div><p>The abundant fertility of the Mekong delta is based on the annual Monsoon cycle.</p><p>Fed by torrential rains, the Mekong begins to swell in June, overbrimming its banks and inundating the surrounding floodplains.

The other, wide expanses of open water.</p></div><div><p>Far from being a disaster, these inundations are welcomed by the local inhabitants.</p><p>During the wet season, the delta is replenished. Fish populations explode. Water infiltrates the soil, dusty from months of little to no precipitation, and is stored in canals and lowland areas.</p><p>The sediments left behind at the end of the wet season are full of nutrients.

In Vietnam, the annual average temperature rise has been <a text="0.1 °C per decade since 1900" url="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112">0.1 °C per decade since 1900</a>, ramping up to 0.14 °C per decade towards the end of the century. Summer temperature increases are even higher, with average monthly temperatures climbing by 0.1–0.3 °C per decade.</p><p>But higher temperatures are not the only contributor to the droughts that have struck the region in recent years.</p></div><p>Meteorological experts trace the immediate cause for this back to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Approximately occurring every four years, El Niño is a global weather event with impacts on local weather. It is caused by a change in temperature distributions in the Pacific Ocean. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions interact to invert the usual east-west direction of ocean surface winds. Now blowing from west to east, they drive warm equatorial waters towards the eastern Pacific. This, in turn, has impacts on weather patterns such as the Monsoon rains over Southeast Asia.</p><div><p>Yearly rainfall in the Mekong basin since 1981</p><p>In El Niño years, there is generally less cumulative rainfall in the river basin.

In Southeast Asia, 2015/16 saw a drought similarly severe as that of 2019.

<p><span>As technological advances continue to build out the digital economy it is perhaps ironic that physical locations still seem to matter so much. Slack and Twitter and Zoom and a host of various collaboration software products have facilitated our ability to communicate with people from all around the world. And yet, up-and-coming founders will still pay 3x the national average in rent so that they can live in Silicon Valley or Manhattan. Despite our ever-improving virtual tools, the triumph of the city is not reversing anytime soon. And the countries with the most vibrant tech clusters will get to decide the pace and the direction of the future. We need both a better understanding of how tech clusters form and how we can maximize their benefits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why and how do tech clusters form?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Economists and urbanists talk a lot about the significance of clustered networks of individuals and firms working and living together in a shared environment. All else equal, having more smart people interacting leads to more ideas which leads to more innovation which leads to more growth. The whole ecosystem of product designers, scientists, engineers, supply chain managers, investors, and academics ends up creating more than the sum of their parts. These </span><a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/"><span>agglomeration effects</span></a><span> occur in cities across the world, but the US has had a unique geopolitical advantage in having the premier industrial clusters for essential technologies like software development and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Defined </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>formally</span></a><span>, we could say that an industrial or tech cluster is a geographic region with a disproportionate share of economic activity, high-skilled technical employment, granted patents, and R&amp;D funding when compared to their share of the national population. Less formally, we could say that tech clusters are in the cities where the most interesting conversations and cutting-edge applications in a particular field are happening.</span></p>

<p><span>San Francisco is the archetypal example, but Boston, Seattle, Austin, and Denver all meet this threshold as well. Larger cities like New York and Los Angeles are more ambiguous, as their share compared to population size is not disproportionate, but narrowing the analysis to a subregion like Manhattan or Santa Monica would likely turn up a traditional tech cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Historically, clusters have been pivotal in driving long-term US growth and for creating innovations that improve the lives of billions of people around the globe. As economists </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>William Kerr and Frederic Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span> summarize, there has been a continual movement of leading tech clusters over time in the US. In the 1800s, Lowell, Massachusetts was the center for textile mills relying on water power. By the early 1900s, Cleveland, Ohio was instrumental in pushing forward the frontier on electricity and steel. Detroit, Michigan, of course, developed into the powerhouse for automobile manufacturing in the mid-1900s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, US tech clusters are the envy of the world. There are only four </span><a href="https://howmuch.net/articles/companies-trillion-dollar-club"><span>trillion dollar companies</span></a><span> in the world. Two of them are based near San Francisco (Apple and Alphabet), and two near Seattle (Amazon and Microsoft). Of the </span><a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/12"><span>global top 30</span></a><span> Internet firms, 14 are based in SF alone.</span></p>
<p><span>The effects that these clusters have on innovation and productivity growth are quite impressive, even on the individual level. Enrico Moretti </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26270"><span>models their impact</span></a><span>: “a computer scientist moving from the median cluster in computer science (Gainesville, FL) to the cluster at the 75th percentile of size (Richmond, VA) would experience a 12.0% increase in productivity, holding constant the inventor and the firm. In biology and chemistry, a move from the median cluster—Boise, ID—to the 75th percentile cluster—State College, PA—is associated with a productivity gain of 8.4%, holding constant the inventor and the firm.” And as the clusters get larger and more specialized, the productivity boosts also get larger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the benefits and significance of tech clusters are fairly well established, what is less well known is precisely how tech clusters originate and why they end up in the specific places they do. That software clustered near San Francisco was not inevitable, that auto manufacturing clustered in Detroit was not fate, that semiconductor fabrication today clusters in Taiwan is not preordained. So how do clusters arise?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, clusters would frequently populate around a specific natural resource that was necessary for the operation of the tech in question, i.e. natural harbors, coal and iron deposits, fast-flowing streams. But the ultimate resources for technology development today are the human minds that can come up with and then implement new ideas. So tech clusters today are mostly about attracting and organizing talented humans in cities they would actually want to live in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>More formally, to become a tech cluster today, a location needs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>An anchor organization as a first-mover in getting high-skilled talent in a particular field to come to a region (usually a firm or a university)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>An urban environment in which firms and workers in adjacent sectors can benefit from large knowledge spillovers as new advances and technical approaches diffuse across the region quickly</span></li>
<li><span>The development of high-velocity labor markets where workers with deep technical expertise can quickly start, join, or leave various firms</span></li>
<li><span>A social scene that is animated by a particular industry or technology area such that the conversations happening in local bars are some of the best in the world for that subfield</span></li>
<li><span>A sufficient supply of industry-specific resources (venture capitalists, relevant scientific or manufacturing infrastructure, government contracts)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A good bit of luck</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s worth emphasizing that the development of a cluster is a process rather than a flip that is switched at a specific moment in time. A location may not have all of these elements right at the very beginning but will need to quickly develop them if it wants to have staying power beyond an initial flash in the pan. Also complicating things, some of these factors suffer from a chicken-or-the-egg problem as it is much easier to attract specialized capital and interested young people to a region once the cluster already exists.</span></p>
<p><span>The historical accidents of particular government policies can sometimes serve as a tiebreaker among competing destinations. One reason that Silicon Valley may have become the primary driver for software development rather than the Boston area is California’s decision to </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/2/13/14580874/google-self-driving-noncompetes"><span>not enforce non-compete agreements</span></a><span>. While not necessarily the intention, this accelerated both the degree of knowledge spillovers and the velocity of labor markets in the region. Today, top developers at large tech companies frequently leave to start competitors and help cutting-edge practices and the more promising technical approaches diffuse quickly throughout the region. This may be frustrating for the particular firms losing out, but it makes the larger tech cluster more vibrant and dynamic. And by increasing the number of approaches attempted to solve an issue, it increases the odds of a breakthrough innovation happening.</span></p>
<p><span>But tech clusters don’t necessarily last forever. As an industry matures and becomes more established it tends to be less reliant on the kind of rapid experimentation and ideation that is facilitated so well by tech clusters. As that happens, an industry may disperse over a larger set of regions, or be subsumed into a more traditional urban agglomeration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unsurprisingly, it seems to be the case that the development of a new </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w11093"><span>general-purpose technology</span></a><span> is usually a prime candidate for allowing new tech clusters to form. But interestingly, there may be a bias towards slightly smaller cities that can operate as more a blank slate for the fledgling industry than can a large, established city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking at the emergence of auto manufacturing as an example, despite having fewer initial entrants and a smaller population, activity started to concentrate in smaller cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and in the ultimate winner, Detroit. According to </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>Kerr and Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span>, this smaller city advantage may have been due to the higher physical proximity of engineers, production line managers, and funders as it was easier to share prototypes, run experiments, and circulate ideas between the relevant stakeholders. These smaller regional hubs may have been able to provide more attention and financial resources to these new firms because there was simply less competition.</span></p>
<p><span>This should not be all too surprising when we consider the softer, cultural aspects that make up an attractive tech cluster. It seems likely that the culture of a city made up disproportionately of geneticists and CRISPR scientists might differ from that of petroleum engineers and fracking specialists. Having a separate city is useful for establishing a different culture and offers a type of specialization that can attract a separate set of weird, ambitious young people that will form the backbone of a cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The conversations in the bars and social scenes of San Francisco feel </span><i><span>very different</span></i><span> from those in the financial district of NYC because the types of people attracted to those cities are very different. To truly become a cluster for a particular field, a city essentially has to reach some critical density of conversations in the social scene to be …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/algae-cover.jpg"></p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published six assessment reports on future climate scenarios with recommended methods of reducing carbon in the atmosphere. The most common of these reports focus on methods by which we can reduce the rate of global warming by 1.5–2°C per year. Scientists use these levels as a benchmark: scientists estimate that 1.5–2°C of warming <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/were-almost-out-of-time-the-alarming-ipcc-climate-report-and-what-to-do-next/">over the next 10 years</a> will cause irreversible changes to Earth’s climate. In 2017, we breached the 1°C warming mark.</p><p>The IPCC has outlined four potential pathways for how the world can avoid these dramatic changes to our environment. According to their research, if we want a chance of staying below 1.5°C, it won’t be by simply reducing emissions—we also need to be actively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. All of the IPCC’s pathways that would lead to a world below 1.5 degrees of warming <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c">require</a> <strong>both reducing and removing CO₂</strong>.</p><div><p>A dire scenario</p><p>The IPCC uses four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to to demonstrate the effects of action or inaction on CO₂ levels in the atmosphere. Climate scientists currently think that RCP 8.5 (sometimes called the 'business-as-usual' pathway) is the most likely scenario.</p><p><label>Entire projection</label><label>Where we are now</label></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>IPCC | The Atlantic</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><p>The IPCC recommendations roughly fall under two categories: reduction and removal of CO₂. Methods of reduction you’ve likely heard of—solar panels, windmills, plant-based diets. At a global scale, these changes would reduce the amount of energy we use and limit our reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p><span><span><div><hr><div><p>Get updates from the Parametric Press</p></div><hr></div></span></span></p><p>On the other side are methods of removal—things that actively suck carbon dioxide out of our atmosphere. Carbon removal includes things like planting more trees and other plants that naturally absorb CO₂. A carbon removal plan might also include newer technologies that use something called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (usually called BECCS, but more on that later).</p><p>This is a story about how we could get there; a story about trees and algae and giant human-sized bioreactors; and ultimately, a story about how maybe our solutions, no matter how innovative, should really be reflecting the natural world around us.</p><h2 id="the-hope-of-a-trillion-trees">The hope of a trillion trees</h2><p>At Davos earlier this year, the World Economic Forum announced a <a text="plan to plant one trillion trees" url="https://www.1t.org/" href="https://www.1t.org/">plan to plant one trillion trees</a> over the next decade. The campaign received widespread approval and enthusiasm from attendees, and even received backing from President Trump through a <a text="recent executive order" url="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html" href="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html">recent executive order</a> to promote tree planting. (This may seem surprising coming from the man who notoriously <a text="withdrew" url="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">withdrew</a> the US from the Paris Agreement on global climate action.)</p><p>But as we’ll see, the possibility of even planting a trillion trees may be more of a political pipedream than an achievable reality.</p><p>A plan for more trees in the world does give us some reason to celebrate. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/natures-make-or-break-potential-for-climate-change/">study</a> comparing natural climate solutions, the top two methods for cost-effectiveness and carbon reduction are 1) planting more trees (reforestation) and 2) keeping the trees we have now from being destroyed (avoided forest conversion).</p><p>The “trillion” target for number of new trees planted is also supported by research: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76">The global tree restoration potential</a>, a study published last year in <em>Science</em>, claimed that planting 1.2 trillion tree saplings on 1.7 billion hectares could remove “two-thirds of all the emissions from human activities that remain in the atmosphere today.” For scale, this would be the equivalent of reforesting an area of land the size of the United States plus Canada combined.</p></div><div><p>Trees, and plants in general, are very good at the <em>removing CO₂ part</em> of our fight against irreversible climate change. Many people categorize this as a viable carbon sequestration method. But there’s a problem with planting a trillion trees: we first need the amount of land to do it. We also need to keep them alive long enough to help us.</p><h2 id="a-trillion-trees-fall-short">A trillion trees fall short</h2><p>Shortly after releasing the study claiming that 1.7 billion hectares of new forests could drastically reduce emissions, the authors of the study received <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay8060/tab-pdf"> a series of sharp rebuttals</a> from the scientific community. Critics claim that the study drastically overestimated the amount of carbon sequestered by trees; alternative models suggest it’s closer to half of what was projected.</p><p>But model estimates aside, the trillion tree plan has a few other significant drawbacks, most important being time and scale. Let’s look at time first.</p><p><span><span>
  Bigger, older trees <a href="https://www.pacificforest.org/ee-old-trees-store-more-carbon-more-quickly-than-younger-trees/">have been shown</a> to be more effective than young trees at reducing CO₂ in the atmosphere. The key is in the leaves: the more time a tree has to generate leaves, the more photosynthesis can happen!</span></span></p><p>Travel booking app Hopper <a href="https://media.hopper.com/news/introducing-hopper-trees">announced</a> earlier this year that for every flight booked through their app, they will donate money to plant four trees. Their back-of-the-envelope math estimates that one tree will sequester around a metric ton of carbon dioxide, which would offset a return trip from a single passenger in the air on a cross country flight. But there’s a problem: Trees don’t spring into the earth fully grown, sucking their max amount of carbon out of the atmosphere.</p><p>Best case estimates show that it will take <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615102/tree-planting-is-a-great-idea-that-could-become-a-dangerous-climate-distraction/">around 25 years</a> before the amount of carbon sequestered matches the amount of carbon emissions for a single person’s share on a single flight (some trees can take up to 100 years to mature fully). So while the strategy may be effective, it won’t help us much in the ~10 years estimated by the IPCC that we have left to prevent irreversible changes to the climate. In fact, a team of scientists at NASA <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2927/examining-the-viability-of-planting-trees-to-help-mitigate-climate-change/">estimate</a> that reforesting 1.7 billion hectares of new trees could take between one and two thousand years.</p></div><div><p>The second obstacle for tree planting is scale. Researchers claim that the available land we have across the world to plant more trees equals about the size of the entire United States (the study from <em>Nature</em> would require land the size of the US <em>plus</em> Canada). But this planting goal also assumes the best case scenario in which humans 1) willingly convert existing land to forests and 2) protect forests with a renewed vigor.</p><p>To take a specific example, let’s look at a single country. The United Kingdom has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. A <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-one-fifth-of-uk-farmland-must-be-used-to-tackle-climate-change">report</a> this year found that in order to reach that goal, the UK would need to commit 20% of its current farmland to dedicated carbon capture and storage uses. And to have a chance at reaching their targets, they need to start doing that, more or less, right now.</p><p>Converting farmland is not an isolated effort either: Reducing traditional crops by around 20% means the government will also count on people to adopt low-carbon farming practices, reduce food waste, and make diet changes described as “a 20% shift away from beef, lamb and dairy to alternative protein sources.”</p><p>If you apply this concept across the world, the amount of farmland we need to convert is daunting. According to the IPCC report, over 70% of Earth’s ice-free land is being used or shaped by human activity. Around 25–30% of this usable land is going straight to producing food, raising cattle, growing cotton for clothes, and energy production.</p><p>On top of all this, if somehow we did find the 1.7bn hectares of suitable land to plant these trees, we would also need to protect them. When trees die, they release all the CO₂ they have eaten up back to the atmosphere. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation/brazil-amazon-deforestation-soars-to-11-year-high-in-2019-idUSKBN1XS1PK">rose by nearly 30% in 2019</a>. On the other side of the globe, bushfires in Australia emitted<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/australias-bushfires-have-emitted-250m-tonnes-of-co2-almost-half-of-countrys-annual-emissions"> nearly half</a> of the country’s annual emissions—and that’s on top of Australia’s usual CO₂ output.</p><h3 id="can-you-remove-all-the-co₂-with-trees?">Can you remove all the CO₂ with trees?</h3><p>To fully understand the complications around relying on trees to save the planet, it’s useful to look at how this actually plays out with a simulation. The interactive version is embedded below, but first a few pointers:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-2.png"></p></div></div><p>Each <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> red dot represents a unit of CO₂. Some studies estimate that a single tree can remove up to 48 lbs CO₂ per year. When a tree sequesters CO₂, it stores this unit as a <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> blue dot. But sadly, sometimes trees are felled, burned, or just die naturally...</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-3.png"></p></div></div><p>When a tree does die, it releases all the CO₂ it removed back into the atmosphere. The simulation keeps track of these “deforestation” events, so when an old tree dies, it releases all the dots it once removed from the air. It also tracks how many years we have left to make meaningful changes (as noted earlier, it’s somewhere between 10–30 years depending on who you ask).</p><p>Plant a forest to see how many trees it would take to remove all the CO₂ bubbles. But be careful: When you lose a tree, you also lose the CO₂!</p></div><div><p>As the simulation illustrates, trees are a vital tool to fighting climate change. But when left unprotected, they can end up recycling the same CO₂ over and over again, never having the time to permanently store it away. Previously <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> sequestered CO₂ returns to <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> historic CO₂. Trees will capture, release, capture, release—and without deforestation prevention, the cycle goes on.</p><p>Planting trees is unquestionably a good idea, but it’s likely not the “silver bullet” solution to fighting climate change. It is simply not enough on its own. We also need to be pursuing new technologies and methods of capturing carbon from the atmosphere, like direct carbon capture from the air. And maybe, we might find inspiration for tackling one of humanity’s biggest technical challenges in one of Earth’s smallest life forms: algae.</p><h2 id="how-algae-removes-co₂-from-the-atmosphere">How algae removes CO₂ from the atmosphere</h2><p>You’ve probably seen algae before—it’s floating about on ponds and washing up on shores as kelp seaweed. It takes many different forms, though. Algae can be as small as 0.2mm in picoplankton and as large as 60m long in the form of giant sea kelp. And incredibly, when you take all the types of algae together, this family of flora produces about half of all oxygen on the planet.</p></div><div><p>In recent years, there has been a …</p></div></div>

  <p>To recognise a chair or a dog, our brain separates objects into their individual properties and then puts them back together. Until recently, it has remained unclear what these properties are.

          The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a dog or, for instance, a piece of furniture.

<p>We live in a world full of things that we have to identify and classify into different categories. Only when you are able to identify the things around you, you can communicate with others about them and act in a meaningful way. If we see something in front of us that we recognise as a chair, we can sit on it. Once we have identified an object as a cup, we can lift it up and drink from it.</p>
<p>In order to carry out this mapping and make sense of our environment, we have to constantly compare the input to our senses with the information we have already learned. To do this, the brain breaks down an object into its individual properties, compares them with those that are already known, and puts these properties back together. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a piece of furniture or a vessel. So far, however, it has remained unclear how we consider things to be similar or less similar. In other words, what are the characteristics that make us recognise objects?</p>
<p>Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, USA, have now identified a set of 49 properties that allow us to determine almost all objects, i.e. the properties underlying their so-called mental representation. This representation reflects the format into which the brain translates a stimulus. In the case of an object, it is composed of, for example, colour, shape and size, but perhaps also of the fact that it "is natural", "can move", "is valuable" or "is animal-related". The researchers had been looking for the set of dimensions that were interpretable and minimally sufficient, i.e. that contained as few properties as possible and yet were enough to describe everything.</p>

<p>"Our results show that it actually takes surprisingly few dimensions to characterise all objects in our environment," says Martin Hebart, first author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00951-3" target="_blank">article describing these results</a>. The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. "From these dimensions we can also infer what is perceived as particularly similar or what is perceived as particularly typical for a category," the neuroscientist continues. Whether, for example, a mussel or a dog is perceived as a more typical animal. "Fundamentally, this explains the basic principles of our thinking about objects."</p>
<p>However, the results could also be used for medical purposes. Until now, it was believed that patients who cannot identify certain animals because of brain damage would not be able to recognise animals as a whole. But it is possible that the patient has a deficit in recognising the characteristic "fluffy" that is a property of many animals. This may then lead to other forms of therapy.</p>
<p>The scientists investigated these relationships with the help of almost 2,000 pictures of objects representative of most things encountered in our environment.&nbsp; They then showed study participants three of the pictures at a time, for example, koala, dog and fish, but also koala, doormat and pretzel. From each of these, the participants were asked to choose the “odd one out”, the one that they perceived to be most different from the other two. In the case of koala, doormat, and pretzel, for some this might have been the koala, because, unlike the other two, it is a living creature or is considered "not flat". For others, it might have been the pretzel, because doormats and koalas are fluffy or you can only eat the pretzel. Yet for others, it might be the doormat, because it is made of inorganic material. This means that the answers are not always clear, but they highlight the relevant properties to find out all the core dimensions of objects.</p>
<p>The researchers tested almost 1.5 million combinations of three objects with the help of nearly 5,500 participants. From this, they developed a computational model which they used to calculate which object was most likely to be chosen to be the odd one out. The more often two objects are left in, the more similar they are. It turned out that their model enabled the scientists to predict the similarity of two objects very precisely. But it also provided the 49 core dimensions that enable us to categorise our world according to simple criteria.</p>

<p>Analogies are always useful to get into the right mindset about how things work. They are even more useful if you’re trying to explain how software engineering works to a non-technical person. </p>



<figure><img src="https://pmtips.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/2285/img-construction-health-safety-environmental-audits.jpg" alt="construction"></figure>



<p>People tend to think that building software involves some kind of black magic.  In reality, this process is a lot more methodical and deterministic but is difficult to explain exactly what we do to any outsider. </p>



<p>It’s really hard to get an accurate analogy because it’s not as deterministic as some manufacturing process like crafting chairs but it’s also not as open-ended as writing a book or painting. </p>



<p>We also tend to think our job is mostly about coding and doing some other technical stuff, but the truth is that the software development process is more about the successful interactions between clients, management and software engineers than any other thing.</p>



<p>One useful analogy that could work is civil engineering. Is simple enough that anyone can understand it but is technically consistent to make it accurate.</p>



<h3>Key Similarities</h3>



<ul><li><strong>You cannot estimate the real effort of a project without doing some work first.</strong> You cannot expect to go to an engineering firm and simply ask “How much will it cost to build a bridge like the Golden Gate?”. <br>If you’re an experienced engineer you probably do some rough estimate using the original cost of the bridge, some similar ongoing project, and some other variables but you know that these kinds of estimates are impossible to do. <br>Anyway, folks go lightly asking “How much an app like uber will cost to do?” and most of us want to bang our heads to the wall trying to explain that this is not how it works.</li><li><strong>Most estimates are bullshit and you’ll probably need a lot more time and money to build that.</strong> This is known in software. Many like to pretend estimates are written on stone but we know that they are at best an educated guess. In the construction business, this is also a thing, but they usually don’t pretend that they know what they are estimating. <br>For example, the<a href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/"> Berlin Airport was estimated to cost </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/" target="_blank">€2 billion</a> in 2006 and was expected to be finished in 2012. This airport is still not finished and it’s expected to open on 31 October 2020 and it will cost at least €6.5 billion to complete.</li><li><strong>Changing things in the middle of the project will cost a shit-ton of money and time. </strong>This is another fact most non-technical managers, product owners, and regular folks like to pretend it doesn’t exist. This is why when you’re building your home you don’t suddenly add an extra floor after 70% of the project is already done. But like I was saying, in the software industry we like to pretend is not a big deal and completely normal to add or remove 50% of the original requirements after we were working on the project for 10 months. </li></ul>



<h3>Some Limitations</h3>



<p>Like any abstraction, they are accurate to a certain degree, and there some big differences we’ll need to take into account.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stability of the requirements.</strong> As we saw changing the requirements in the middle of the construction is sometimes prohibitively expensive and some other times borderline impossible. That’s why you wouldn’t turn a house into a sky-crapper halfway down the project. That’s a common practice in software development.</li><li><strong>Stability of prices and scale.</strong> Construction has some major advantages over software development. Most construction materials have stable and known prices and can be bought in bulk even with leasing plans. The scale of the project is also known beforehand, so you can more or less get an accurate estimate of workers and machines you’ll need.</li><li><strong>Documentation. </strong>Even to build a little project like a house requires a hell-lot of documentation and calculations, you’ll need at least 3 different architectural plans. In most software projects documentation is non-existent or completely obsolete because it was never updated after the beginning of the coding phase.</li></ul>

<p>Today we are thrilled to announce the Turing Pi V2. We’ve been collecting a massive amount of information, synthesizing all of it in product variations, and thinking about what steps we should do next. Today we are going to announce only some of the fundamental details about the V2. We are still working on checking some of the hypotheses, but believe me, the other parts of the announcement will be exciting too. We will disclose more closer to opening orders. </p>



<p>After we released the original 7 nodes Turing Pi, we had many questions. What to do next, how to increase the product’s value, what compute modules to choose, how many nodes, etc. We decided to determine the minimal cluster block size with options to connect hard drives and extension boards. The cluster block should be a self-sustained base node and with ample scope of scale. Next, we wanted the minimum cluster blocks to have an option to connect and form cluster federations and, at the same time, be cost-efficient and easy to scale. The speed of scale should be higher than connecting regular computers on the network and cheaper than the typical server hardware. Another thing, the minimum cluster units should be compact enough, mobile, energy-efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. This is one of the key differences between server racks and everything related to them.</p>



<h3>Number of nodes</h3>



<p>To determine the minimal cluster unit, we started by picking the optimal number of nodes. By simple logical judgments, we realized that a 4 nodes cluster is the best option. One node is not a cluster. Two nodes, not enough – 1 master and 1 worker doesn’t give too many options to scale within the block, especially for heterogeneous options. Three nodes look better but still limited to scale the block. We decided to choose 4 nodes option. More than 4 nodes would be either more expensive for PoC or challenging to fit into the mini ITX form factor.</p>



<p>We believe 4 nodes is a golden median because:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The more affordable production cost of the cluster board and allows getting a more affordable fully equipped cluster as a result</li><li>A more solid architecture with 1 main node and 3 workers</li><li>More heterogeneous variations with general-compute + accelerated-compute</li></ul>



<h3>Compute modules</h3>

<p>While searching the compute modules, we opened a whole market—various modules with 128 MB RAM to 8 GB RAM. We are expecting to see 16 Gb RAM options soon too. For hosting cloud-native apps on the edge, 1 GB of RAM is already not enough, and the recent appearance of modules with 2, 4, and even 8 GB of RAM provides good space for growth. We also considered options with FPGA modules for machine learning but decided to hold on to this because the software ecosystem is still not mature enough. While studying the compute modules market, we came up with ​​creating a unified compute module interface that we are implementing in the Turing Pi 2. This will allow connecting compute modules from other manufacturers and also combine different purpose modules to solve specific tasks.</p>



<p>Today we are announcing V2 support for the Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module (CM4), including Lite and 8 GB RAM versions.</p>

<h3>Peripherals</h3>



<p>After determining the compute modules vendor and the number of nodes, we started to study the PCI bus option. The PCI bus is a standard for peripheral devices, and it is found in almost all compute modules. We have several nodes and ideally so that each node can share PCI devices in concurrent request mode. For example, if a hard drive is connected to the bus, it is available to all nodes. We started looking for PCI switches with multi-host support and found that none of them fit our requirements. These solutions were mostly limited to 1 host or multi-hosts, but no concurrent endpoints request mode. The second problem is the high cost of $50 or more per chip. In the Turing Pi 2, we decided to postpone experiments with PCI switches and return to this later as we mature. So far, we decided to assign a role for each node along the path: the first two nodes are exposed to mini PCI express port, the third node is exposed to 2-ports 6 Gbps SATA controller. You can use the network file system within the cluster to access hard drives from other nodes. Why not?</p>



<h3>Sketches &amp; result</h3>



<p>We decided to share some sketches of how the minimal cluster unit evolved over time through discussions and observations.</p>

<p>As a result, we came to a cluster unit with 4x 260-pin nodes, 2x mini PCIe (Gen 2) ports, 2x SATA (Gen 3) ports. The cluster board has a Layer-2 Managed Switch with VLAN support. You can use the mini PCIe port connected to the first node to install a network card and get another Ethernet port or connect a 5G modem and make the first node perform as a router.</p>

<p>The cluster management bus has more functions now, including the ability to flash modules directly through all slots and of course, FAN connectors with speed control on each node.</p>



<h3>Use cases</h3>



<h4>Edge infrastructure for self-hosted applications &amp; services</h4>



<p>We designed the Turing Pi 2 as a minimal building block for consumer / commercial-grade edge infrastructure. With V2, it’s affordable to start a proof-of-concept and scale as you grow, gradually migrating applications that are more cost-effective and practical to host on the edge. Cluster blocks can be linked together and form larger clusters. This can be done sequentially without interrupting already established processes. There are already a huge number of business applications to<a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> host apps locally</a>.</p>



<h4>ARM Workstation</h4>



<p>With up to 32 GB of RAM per cluster unit, the first node can be used to run the desktop version of the OS, for example Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS. The remaining 3 nodes can be used for compilation, testing, debugging tasks, and development of cloud-native solutions for ARM clusters.</p>



<p>The Turing V2 cluster is architecturally similar to the AWS Graviton clusters. The CM4 processor uses the ARMv8 architecture. You can build images and applications for AWS instances of Graviton 1 and 2, which are known to be much cheaper than x86 instances. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Turing V2 can easily be included in the existing clusters (cloud or on-premises) and shared with other participants using Kubernetes RBAC.</p>



<h3>Wrapout</h3>



<p>The Turing Pi 2 is more functional than V1 and we also expect it to be cheaper to manufacture. </p>



<p>We are very grateful to everyone who supported us and baked the Turing Pi project by purchasing the Turing Pi V1. The Turing Pi 2 wouldn’t be possible without your support. As a way to thank our supporters, we will offer 25% off for the Turing Pi 2 for everyone who purchased the V1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s it for now. We hope you are excited about the upcoming V2 which we plan to release next year. We will post more updates on the progress along the way. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Angry European farmers are pushing for a ban on calling vegetarian products a "burger" or a "sausage", that they say mislead consumers into thinking certain products contain meat.</p>
<p>Their demand was part of a legislative proposal at the European Parliament, which MEPs are to vote on later this week in Brussels.</p>
<p>The ban request comes on the back of the rising success of high-end veggieburgers that closely replicate the taste and sensation of eating meat.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism is also gaining ground due to the link between raising cattle and climate change.</p>
<p>Also banned would be products labelled as "yoghurt-style" or "cheese-like" for non-dairy based products. Terms such as "soy milk" and "vegan cheese" are already banned in the EU.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, "terms and descriptions referring to 'meat' should be reserved exclusively for the parts of animals fit for human consumption".</p>
<p>The draft text lists "steak", "sausage", "escalope", "burger" and "hamburger" as examples of banned words.</p>
<p>The parliament's agriculture committee proposed the passage as an amendment to a vast farming bill that would go to a vote on Tuesday.</p><p>Jean-Pierre Fleury, of the EU's farmers association Copa and Cogeca, called the misuse of meat labels "an obvious case of cultural hijacking."</p>
<p>"We are about to create a brave new world where marketing is disconnected from the real nature of products, which is just asking for things to spin out of control!" he said earlier this month.</p>
<p>Food advocacy group ProVeg International said the opposite was true and that the terms "provide important information regarding the taste and uses that people can expect from a product."</p>
<p>"Just as we all know that peanut butter does not contain butter, consumers know exactly what they are getting when they buy veggie burgers or veggie sausages," said ProVeg's Alex Gromminger.</p>
<p>Hervé Salomon, director for France of veggie butter-maker Upfield, called the proposal "totally absurd" and said it went against everything the EU is trying to achieve in terms of lowering pollution in farming.</p>
<p>Voting results should be available no earlier than Wednesday.</p>
<p>If the present text is adopted, it would then be negotiated with EU member states as part of a reform to the EU's agriculture policies.</p>

What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world.”</em></p><p>Sean Harper is the CEO and co-founder of Kin Insurance, a Chicago-based home insurance start-up focused on using technology to offer homeowners the lowest rates as quickly as possible. He does so in an industry known for moving slowly. “We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most,” Harper says of Kin. Prior to founding Kin in 2016, Harper founded Fee Fighters, later sold to Groupon, and TSS-Radio, an e-commerce company. Prior to Kin, both Harper and co-founder Lucas Ward consulted for top financial companies, including several for PNC.&nbsp;</p><p>Kin offers home insurance in Florida and California, both states known for their catastrophe exposure. Kin recently closed a $35 million Series B funding round led by Commerce Ventures, which brings its total funding to date to $90 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview:</p><ul><li>How Harper moved from consulting to start-ups to founding Kin</li><li>The 3 criteria Harper wanted in creating a start-up</li><li>How Kin innovates compared to legacy insurance companies</li><li>Kin’s entry into catastrophe insurance coverage</li><li>Why Kin is better at underwriting insurance than legacy companies</li><li>The future of insurance online and the value of real customer service</li><li>Kin’s culture, early experiments and what Kin is focusing on next&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>I would love to hear about your background and how you came about founding Kin.</strong></p><p>My co-founder Lucas and I have been doing online financial services for a long time. We just sort of fell into the start-up thing and realized we liked it a lot. The great thing about consulting gigs is you get to see a lot of stuff that big companies aren't doing very well. We really enjoy doing start-ups because you can start with a blank sheet of paper and do it the right way. If you're a software geek, which we both are, you look around for problems that are easy for you to solve. Financial services are easy to solve because it's all online. There's no physical product to worry about. And we're good at online stuff. And really I think if you look at the core of a bank or an insurance company or stock trading company, they're actually software companies, but they're not very good at software. We’re a few companies in now. We’re good at it now, building financial companies from scratch.</p><p><strong>Were you in or around the insurance area at all?</strong></p><p>Almost all the consulting I did was in financial services and the same for Lucas. We worked at, between the two of us, probably three of the five top P&amp;C financial companies. Basically, Lucas and I had come out of selling our companies and we were kicking around for two and a half years trying to come up with our big idea. In the meantime, we were doing interim gigs for private equity backed companies. We didn't want to sell technology to big financial institutions because their adoption cycles are so slow. We wanted to go direct to the consumer and beyond that, we were looking for three criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>First, I wanted to be in a large and homogenous market. Second, I wanted it to be a market where it was very inefficient. I didn't want to have to win on underwriting at the onset, because it's really hard to win on underwriting until you have data. Now we have a bunch of data. And we have a huge underwriting advantage over our competitors, but on day one, I didn't want to have to do that because it's a good way to get blown up. The third thing I wanted was for there to be new data sources available for pricing and underwriting.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn't just look at insurance. We looked at all financial services. We found catastrophe-exposed homeowners insurance. It fits all those criteria. It's a $40 billion market and growing fast to extraordinarily inefficient expense ratios. The amount of money that's wasted is about 40% of every dollar they collect. And there's just a ton of data out there – the weather that's around the home, geography, the neighborhood, the construction.&nbsp;</p><p>Most insurance companies are underwriting on the same 20 to 40 fields of data that's all self reported or agent reported. They're basically doing it the same way they've been doing it for 100 years. The business model has changed and the main way it's changed since we've climbed our way up the stack is we started as a digital broker, similar to a company like Zebra or Gabi, and then we became an MGA, which is sort of a virtual insurance company. And then last year, we actually formed our own insurance entity. We did that because it's really hard to raise enough money to start an insurance company on day one. We had to build our way to it. We learned a lot at each stage that made us know we were ready to go to the next stage.</p><p><strong>You operate on this specific segment of the home insurance market: catastrophe-prone homes.</strong></p><p>In the United States, there's about 100 billion dollars of premium spent every year on homeowners insurance. It's growing 3% to 4% a year, and of that 100 billion, 40 billion of it is catastrophe exposed. It's a huge niche and it is clear that the weather is getting worse. Let’s hope we can reverse that, but it's not going to happen overnight. We're going to need to deal with it by having good insurance that allows us to spread the risk out, ready to deal with it by investing and hardening our homes to make them more weather resilient. So, we find our work meaningful because we're working on insurance for people who need it. And I think it's only a matter of time. Here in Chicago, we're pretty sheltered from extreme weather, but it is affecting more and more places. And so even more of the market will end up being catastrophe exposed next year and year after year.</p><p><strong>Why are you guys better at underwriting your home insurance than someone else?</strong></p><p>We are much more efficient at administering and servicing. We talked about the cost structure before. About 60% goes to pay claims and about 40% goes to other stuff. For us, that 40% is more like 8%, so we're just very efficient. We don't pay brokers. Brokers occupy about 17% of that 40%. We're very efficient at marketing and we have a very good tech system. Your average insurance company spends about 5% of premiums for their IT on an ongoing basis. Yet, their biggest problem is their tech doesn't work. We’re also really good now at understanding the physical properties of the home and the micro environment around it. We know the difference in risk between being the second house off the water and the fourth house off the water in California. Are you right next to the brush land or is there a road between you and the brush land? Because it makes a huge difference. And we're able to ingest all this data and understand on a micro basis which homes are more or less risky. Then we're able to price it properly.</p><p><strong>What’s stopping a legacy insurer from utilizing the same types of data that you do?</strong></p><p>In theory, nothing. In fact, four years ago, the way we came up with this idea was by going around and talking to a lot of people from the industry and finding all the smart things that they wish they could do but couldn't. At the core, every insurance company actually is a software company. We have a really cutting edge policy administration system, our core processing system. It's leaps and bounds better than what any of our competitors have. It does exactly what we need it to do and it's really easy to change. So if we want to launch a new product or add a new data source, these are the kinds of things that might take us hours and take our competitors years. What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world. Our competitors are not able to react quickly.</p><p><strong>You said that you're able to issue new products at a faster rate. What are some examples?</strong></p><p>We saw an opportunity to do insurance for manufactured homes, a very underserved market, in Florida, which is also underserved because of its catastrophe exposure. We actually launched that product in less than a month, including regulatory approval, and that&nbsp;doesn't happen in insurance.</p><p><strong>A surprising amount of insurance is still being sold through physical agents, not online. How do you view that? Is the wind ultimately blowing in your direction for insurance being purchased online?</strong></p><p>I just turned 40 so I'm sort of borderline millennial and I was sure I was building this for people my age and younger. Amazingly – we realized this three months after we launched and it's still true – our average customer is in their mid 50s. It shouldn't be that surprising. The average age of a homeowner is late 40s, and in Florida, it's higher. But then you start talking to these people and the thing is, they all bank online. Their retirement accounts are all online; they all have the Capital One or Amex credit card. Even they think it's weird to buy insurance at a store.&nbsp;</p><p>We do a lot of customer support on the phone and via email with a real human. Being techie does not mean that you need to be inhuman. If you think about our name, it's Kin. That's family. I don't send automated messages to my children. I talk to them in person. That's how families act with each other. So it doesn't need to be impersonal just because it's tech-based. That's a really big part of who we are. We like having this human element. A home is somebody's biggest asset for the most part. It's nice to be able to ask a person a question like, “Hey, I saw this on the website. Can you explain that to me?” So that actually is a huge role in our customer experience.</p><p><strong>How’s business been in the past five or six months, given that most of the current climate has changed?</strong></p><p>There's been no impact on consumer demand. Probably the biggest impact for us has been operationally. We've been operating remotely. We're located in Tampa and Chicago and we like our office. We like hanging out with each other. We like going for drinks after work. We like playing ping pong. We like working on the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <h3><em>OSC</em> 52</h3>
<p>ever yanked something in nvim,
switched to another window to paste,
then remembered the nvim was through ssh
and it didn't share a clipboard with your system?</p>
<p>First discovered while reading through the chrome ssh / hterm
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/+/master/nassh/doc/FAQ.md#Is-OSC-52-aka-clipboard-operations_supported">faq</a>,
OSC 52 uses escape sequences to let you send things through to the local clipboard.
Requires a terminal emulator support.</p>
<h4>testing for support</h4>
<p>run the following in an ssh session</p>
<p><code>copypasta!</code> should appear in your local clipboard ready for pasting</p>
<pre><code>printf "\033]52;c;Y29weXBhc3RhIQ==\a\n"
</code></pre>
<h4><em>vim</em> plugins</h4>
<ul>
<li>chromium provides a vim script <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/+/master/hterm/etc">osc52.vim</a></li>
<li>also available in a repo for plugin loading <a href="https://github.com/fcpg/vim-osc52">fcpg/vim-osc52</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haya14busa/vim-poweryank">poweryank</a> implements the same functionality with more code</li>
</ul>
<h4><em>neovim</em></h4>
<p>The vim plugins didn't work when i tested them,
looking at the neovim issues, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8450">8450</a> stood out.
That script basically worked, but requires an extra script outside.

<p>It has been a big year for realizing the limits of technology for interacting with people. Gamers have known this for a long time. Lag, disconnections, and coordination issues were problems in gaming since the start. There is a platform that has gone a long way in solving those problems: Discord.</p>



<p>Discord allows people to talk and chat online. Servers are created by anybody to talk about anything, usually, it is a friend group or a shared interest. They contain chat channels (kind of like Slack) and voice channels that are always on and allow people to join and leave whenever they want.</p>



<p>The competition between internet communication platforms is fierce. Discord wasn’t early to voice channels or group chats. They weren’t unique for targeting their offering to gamers. Other platforms have the same features as them. Yet they are a multi-billion dollar business. How? To borrow an idea from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/how-to-build-an-enduring-multi-billion-dollar-business-hint-create-a-10x-product-recast-3527df2b8fcb" target="_blank">Sarah Tavel</a>, they built a 10x better product AND capture more value from it.</p>



<h2>10x Better</h2>



<p>Voice chat sucked for a long time. Skype, which was long the most popular option, was a mess. It forced you to call people. Servers went down often. The application crashed. Chats were all over the place. There is a good reason people do not use Skype and it is because it sucks.</p>



<p>There were other competitors like IRC, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo. All had basically the same features, voice calls, and chat. Each suffered from a combination of problems like:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated setup process. Any new member must also go through a setup process.</li><li>Paid hosting. No one wanted to pay when there were free options. Especially true as servers grow.</li><li>Unclear benefits. Convincing one person was not enough, you needed to convince your whole group of the benefits of switching.</li><li>Weird ideological reasons. Your platform was your tribal affiliation, switching means abandoning your tribe. Everyone looked down on people who didn’t use the same platform as them (even if it was jokingly).</li></ul>



<p>Discord launched in May 2015, long after the competitors listed above. They are now more successful than those same competitors. They did so by making the experience 10x better:</p>



<ul><li>Discord requires nearly no setup. Starting a server on Discord takes two clicks. Creating channels is two clicks. It works instantly and all the time.</li><li>Discord is free.</li><li>It is easy to switch to Discord. Inviting people is two clicks and a paste. Joining a server (once you have an account) is two clicks. It is so simple you don’t even think about it.</li><li>Non-core features like emoji support, reactions, bots, integrations, video calls, and screen-sharing all work as well as you could ask.</li><li>Big community servers for games, fanbases, organizations, hobbies, and more.</li></ul>



<p>Improvements in each of these areas add up to a 10x better experience than other platforms. I complain about Discord way less than I complain about Skype. There are benefits for everyone on Discord, which makes it a 10x experience both for groups and individuals.</p>



<p>On top of being 10x better, the core features are free. This causes an obvious business problem, how do you make money? There isn’t an obvious place to put ads. Competitors often charge by the member, but that incentivizes against growth. Discord figured out a way to incentivize growth while capturing value from large and small groups. </p>



<h2>Sell Status to Capture Value</h2>



<p>It took Discord a long time to figure out monetization (and they still are figuring it out). Venture capital allowed them to experiment with ideas such as selling games and membership. Neither worked perfectly, but they pointed in the right direction. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/06/30/discord-was-once-the-alt-rights-favorite-chat-app-now-its-gone-mainstream-and-scored-a-new-35-billion-valuation/#article-0-topx-1:~:text=Discord%20is%20on%20track%20to%20top,Discord%20groups%20that%20they%20belong%20to." target="_blank">Forbes estimated</a> they are “on track to top $120 million in sales this year (2020)… up from around $70 million last year.”</p>



<p>To understand Discord’s monetization, look at their history. The founders previously started game companies and were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)#cite_ref-vb_2015_funding_9-0:~:text=%5D%20Their%20first%20product%20was%20Fates,and%20based%20on%20more%20modern%20technology.%5B" target="_blank">inspired by free-to-play games like League of Legends.</a> Games like League of Legends sell status. It is free-to-play but you can buy “skins” to make your character look different. If you have a cool or expensive skin, it means you care more about the game. It raises your status. Discord does the same.</p>



<p>Discord allows users to raise their status through a subscription called Nitro. It provides quality improvements (file size and video quality), special profile upgrades (more emojis, animated profile photos, custom tags), and most importantly, the ability to “boost” a server.</p>



<p>Boosts raise a user’s status in both small and large servers. They allow you to either improve your friend’s online hangout and your communities’ experience by unlocking custom emotes, cosmetic features, and quality improvements. For users, it puts an icon next to their name saying they contribute and gives them a special booster role on the server. In short, it is a way for someone to pay to stand out.</p>

<p>You can buy boosts separately from Nitro at $5 per month or $50 per year. Perks come in uneven tiers: Level 1 is 2 boosts, Level 2 is 15 boosts, Level 3 is 30 boosts. It is unlikely “friend group sized” servers get past two boosts, but large servers often pass thirty. Some examples:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Name</th><th data-align="left">Boosts</th><th data-align="left">MRR (@ $5 per boost)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Minecraft</td><td data-align="left">165</td><td data-align="left">$825</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Kanye</td><td data-align="left">75</td><td data-align="left">$375</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Fortnite</td><td data-align="left">165</td><td data-align="left">$825</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">r/LeagueOfLegends</td><td data-align="left">201</td><td data-align="left">$1005</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</td><td data-align="left">412</td><td data-align="left">$2060</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">r/Overwatch</td><td data-align="left">85</td><td data-align="left">$425</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Rocket League</td><td data-align="left">116</td><td data-align="left">$580</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Fall Guys</td><td data-align="left">215</td><td data-align="left">$1075</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Anime Soul Discord</td><td data-align="left">323</td><td data-align="left">$1615</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Kenny Beats</td><td data-align="left">50</td><td data-align="left">$250</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Musicians (Turkish)</td><td data-align="left">730</td><td data-align="left">$3650</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">English</td><td data-align="left">94</td><td data-align="left">$470</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Python</td><td data-align="left">44</td><td data-align="left">$220</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">CallMeCarson Discord Cult</td><td data-align="left">1153</td><td data-align="left">$5765</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here are 14 popular servers accounting for nearly $250,000 in revenue per year. There are tons more, all with varying amounts of boosts. People are willing to pay to stand out, even when there is no obvious benefit. This is universal.</p>



<p>Every community needs a place to communicate online. Discord has the best offering, and it is free. Other platforms either force you to pay by the member or have a flat rate paid by the community host. Discord doesn’t require either. Servers can grow as large as they want for free, moderators and admins don’t have to pay, and Discord still makes money.</p>



<p>As communities continue to grow on Discord, the money Discord makes from those communities goes up as well. Flat rates and tiers limit this. Communities want to grow, Discord provides them with an easy and effective way to do that. Users want status, Discord gives them a shortcut. This aligns incentives better than advertising or paid memberships do.</p>



<hr>



<p>Discord won by building 10x better spaces for communities. By selling status, they have also managed to capture more value from those communities than other platforms.</p>



<p>Discord won the competition for the gaming chat platform of choice, and now it wants to be the platform for all internet communities. This means they will be competing with the “big dogs” like Slack, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and Epic. Their free-to-play, pay-for-status monetization model is a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Discord is a successful company. The question becomes how successful can they become? The key is the number of internet communities who choose Discord as their home. By creating a better product than competitors and being free for growth, Discord puts itself in an excellent position to continue to succeed moving forward.</p>

					<div>
						<p>The question of how scientific advances flow through to practical applications is central to our understanding of progress, and guides research funding policy.</p>
<p>The tone on this issue for the second half of the 20th century was set in 1945 by Vannevar Bush’s landmark report “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">Science, the Endless Frontier</a>”. One theme, already widely accepted in American industrial culture and given official voice in Bush’s report, was that basic research, although not guided by practical uses, is nonetheless necessary for long-term progress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends. … The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the early 1950s, the newly created National Science Foundation was justifying its mission based on an explicit model of technological development as a flow from basic research through to development. Quoting from the NSF’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1952/annualreports/ar_1952_sec2.pdf">second annual report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technological sequence consists of basic research, applied research, and development… each of the successive stages depends upon the preceding. Unlimited expansion of effort toward applied research and development, without corresponding support for basic research, will defeat the entire effort by limiting technological progress to minor improvements and refinements of obsolete processes and equipment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an important truth in this “linear model” of innovation. But there is also much more interaction between science and invention than a naive interpretation of the model would imply.</p>
<p>The truth in the model is that science is, in an important sense, the foundation for invention. The <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won">electric power industry</a> would not have been possible before the science of electromagnetism: Michael Faraday’s 1831 discovery that a moving magnet creates a current in a nearby wire is the law that the electric generator, deployed widely decades later, depends on. Plastics were not created until chemistry was well-established: the first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was created by a Belgian-American chemist, Leo Baekeland, after <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html#invention-of-bakelite">careful experimentation</a> inspired by the potential of phenol-formaldehyde compounds established by previous researchers.</p>
<p>Technological development is possible through ad-hoc tinkering, but without a scientific base, such development eventually plateaus. Sanitation reformers made only limited progress against disease before the germ theory, because they were guided only by perceptible qualities such as the look, smell, and taste of the water supply. The understanding that microbes were the cause of disease refined their understanding of the goal and gave them new ways to measure the success of their efforts. It was after this, for example, that <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp">chlorination was added to water treatment</a>, and pasteurization to food processing.</p>
<p>Practical applications often flow naturally from science: a deeper understanding of nature suggests possible uses. But science does not flow from applications, because it is not obvious <i>what </i>science might apply to a given problem. As <a href="https://gemenne.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/nelson-basic-economics-of-scientific-research.pdf">Richard Nelson pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is seriously to be doubted whether X-ray analysis would ever have been discovered by any group of scientists who, at the turn of the century, decided to find a means for examining the inner organs of the body … It seems most unlikely that a group of scientists in the mid-nineteenth century, attempting to develop a better method of long-range communication, would have developed Maxwell’s equations and radio.</p></blockquote>
<p>The impact of science on invention is long-term and often impossible to foresee. There are some times, certainly, when scientific pursuits have obvious applications: when Robert Koch identified the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, he must have known that this would someday help us prevent or cure the disease. But when Bohr peered into the structure of the atom, or when Rutherford and Curie investigated the nature of radiation, it is doubtful that they expected their work to lead to nuclear power or MRI scans.</p>
<p>Investments in science, then, if motivated by long-term progress, cannot be prioritized by immediate practical impact. It requires, in Bush’s words, “the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.”</p>
<p>However, in the naive interpretation of this model, the stages are fully distinct, non-overlapping, and separated by a clean handoff. Science is pursued out of pure curiosity, with no thought of applications. It discovers elegant natural laws, which are crisply formulated, written down, and then thrown over the transom to engineering. Invention is then a straightforward process of deductively applying these laws to practical problems.</p>
<p>But the relationship between science and invention is not one-way. It is reciprocal.</p>
<p>Invention is rarely, if ever, a pure deduction from established physical laws. Inventors tinker, often right at the boundaries of scientific knowledge—where the best opportunities are. Edison famously tested thousands of materials as filaments for his light bulb to find one that would last long enough to make the bulb economical. Charles Goodyear <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-goodyear">experimented for many years</a> to create an improved form of rubber that would not become soft in the heat or brittle in the cold, finally hitting on pressure-treating with sulfur as the key process to create what he would call “vulcanized”&nbsp;rubber. Even today, drugs are discovered by screening thousands of compounds against a target.</p>
<p>Science, of course, often <i>guides</i> this experimentation. Edison was specifically <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/lamp.htm">looking for a high-resistance material</a>; he knew from his understanding of the physics of electric circuits that a high-resistance bulb would require less power. Drug compounds, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790789/">including some early antibiotics</a>, are discovered by modifying “side chains” of a known molecule. Without scientific background knowledge, pure tinkering often has too many possibilities to explore; science narrows the search.</p>
<p>Sometimes when an invention is produced by tinkering, science cannot explain its operating characteristics, or even why it works at all. Aspirin was first marketed in 1899, but its mechanism of action <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20631416/">wasn’t explained until 1971</a>. These cases can inspire new theories or even entire new fields. The field of thermodynamics was created in the 1800s in part to explain the working of heat engines, such as the steam engines that had been invented in the previous century. A better scientific understanding of technology then helps us optimize or expand it. The first vaccine, for smallpox, was <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines">invented in 1796</a>, but no one was able to replicate this success for any other disease until almost ninety years later, after the advent of the germ theory.</p>
<p>When the right researchers are brought together in the right environment, this iterative process combining both science and engineering can even be driven forward by the same people, in the same lab, on a single project. A dramatic example is <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention">the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs</a>. Researchers went back to the drawing board multiple times to improve the theory of semiconductor physics, in order to explain their experimental results. Each improvement to the theory let them make the next advance in engineering: from failed prototypes, to the first working “point-contact” transistor, to the improved “junction” transistor that became the standard design.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest researchers were those who were able to pivot rapidly from discovery to invention, or vice versa, as the opportunity arose. The master of this was <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, a pioneer of microbiology. Some of his greatest scientific discoveries came from projects with purely practical, commercial goals. His work to improve the processes of wine, beer, and vinegar makers led to the discovery of anaerobic metabolism and the role of microbes in fermentation; his assistance to the growers of silk worms gave him observations that ultimately led to the germ theory of disease. At other times, while engaged in scientific research, Pasteur was able to seize on an accidental discovery when he saw its practical applications. This is how a botched experiment with chicken cholera led to <a href="https://www.vbivaccines.com/wire/louis-pasteur-attenuated-vaccine/">the first laboratory-created vaccines</a>, including a vaccine for rabies.</p>
<p>So the “clean handoff” model is wrong. Instead, we should replace it with a “gap” model. Science gives inventors a conceptual framework: a toolbox of categories, principles, and equations that provide fertile ground for practical experimentation. But through experimentation, inventors can discover working solutions outside the bounds of what has been fully explained by science. They can’t get <i>too </i>far ahead of scientific understanding—Bell Labs would never even have created a semiconductor research group if physics hadn’t first identified semiconductors as a material.</p>
<p>But if the distance between known science and a desired invention is short enough, they can cross the gap. They can bridge the gap with their own experiments, extending scientific knowledge; or they can leap over it, ending up with an invention that works for reasons yet to be explained. Leaping the gap can actually pull science forward, giving it new phenomena to explore and new motivation to do so.</p>
<p>As a consequence, influence does not flow in one direction only, from science to invention. Invention feeds back into science, and rapid progress can come from a tight integration of the two.</p>
<p>Our assumptions about how research happens guide how we fund, organize, and manage it.</p>
<p>The great corporate laboratories of the early 20th century, which integrated basic research and product development under one roof, <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-rd-lab/">have gone into decline</a>. Today the people, projects, and institutions who do science and invention are more separate than they were in those days. Startups and venture capitalists mostly don’t do …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>About a lifetime ago (5 years), I wrote a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">tutorial on how to
configure my Yubikey for OpenPGP signing, SSH authentication and SSH
2FA</a>. In there, I used the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/">libpam-oath</a>
PAM plugin for authentication, but it turns out that had too many
problems: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807992">users couldn't edit their own 2FA tokens</a> and I had to
patch it to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807990">avoid forcing 2FA on all users</a>. The latter was merged
in the Debian package, but never upstream, and the former was never
fixed at all. So I started looking at alternatives and found the
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/">Google Authenticator libpam plugin</a>. A priori, it's designed to
work with phones and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google Authenticator app</a>, but there's no
reason why it shouldn't work with hardware tokens like the
Yubikey. Both use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">standard HOTP protocol</a> so it should "just
work".</p>

<p>After some fiddling, it turns out I was right and you <em>can</em>
authenticate with a Yubikey over SSH. Here's that procedure so you
don't have to second-guess it yourself.</p>






<p>On Debian, the PAM module is shipped in the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/google-authenticator">google-authenticator</a>
source package:</p>

<pre><code>apt install libpam-google-authenticator
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to add the module in your PAM stack somewhere. Since I
only use it for SSH, I added this line on top of <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
</code></pre>

<p>I also used <code>no_increment_hotp debug</code> while debugging to avoid having
to renew the token all the time and have more information about
failures in the logs.</p>

<p>Then reload ssh (not sure that's actually necessary):</p>

<pre><code>service ssh reload
</code></pre>



<p>To create a new key, run this command on the server:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator -c
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for a bunch of questions. To get them all right,
I prefer to just call the right ones on the commandline directly:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator --counter-based --qr-mode=NONE --rate-limit=1 --rate-time=30 --emergency-codes=1 --window-size=3
</code></pre>

<p>Those are actually the defaults, if my memory serves me right, except
for the <code>--qr-mode</code> and <code>--emergency-codes</code> (which can't be disabled
so I only print one). I disable the QR code display because I won't be
using the codes on my phone, but you would obviously keep it if you
want to use the app.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the encoding (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5">base32</a>) produced by the
<code>google-authenticator</code> command is not compatible with the token
expected by the <code>ykpersonalize</code> command used to configure the Yubikey
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#page-8">base16</a> AKA "hexadecimal", with a fixed 20 bytes length). So you
need a way to convert between the two. I wrote a program called
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/oath-convert">oath-convert</a> which basically does this:</p>

<pre><code>read base32
add padding
convert to hex
print
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in Python:</p>

<div><pre><span>def</span> <span>convert_b32_b16</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>):</span>
    remainder <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>) %</span> <span>8</span>
    <span>if</span> remainder <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span># XXX: assume 6 chars are missing, the actual padding may vary:</span>
        <span># https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5</span>
        data_b32 <span>+=</span> <span>"======"</span>
    data_b16 <span>=</span> base64<span>.</span><span>b32decode</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>) &lt;</span> <span>20</span><span>:</span>
        <span># pad to 20 bytes</span>
        data_b16 <span>+=</span> b<span>"</span><span>\x00</span><span>"</span> <span>* (</span><span>20</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> binascii<span>.</span><span>hexlify</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>).</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>"ascii"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the code assumes a certain token length and will not work
correctly for other sizes. To use the program, simply call it with:</p>

<pre><code>head -1 .google_authenticator | oath-convert
</code></pre>

<p>Then you paste the output in the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ ykpersonalize -1 -o oath-hotp -o append-cr -a
Firmware version 3.4.3 Touch level 1541 Program sequence 2
 HMAC key, 20 bytes (40 characters hex) : [SECRET GOES HERE]

Configuration data to be written to key configuration 1:

fixed: m:
uid: n/a
key: h:[SECRET REDACTED]
acc_code: h:000000000000
OATH IMF: h:0
ticket_flags: APPEND_CR|OATH_HOTP
config_flags: 
extended_flags: 

Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must NOT pass the <code>-o oath-hotp8</code> parameter to the
<code>ykpersonalize</code> commandline, which we used to do in the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">Yubikey
howto</a>. That is because Google Authenticator
tokens are shorter: it's less secure, but it's an acceptable tradeoff
considering the plugin is actually maintained. There's actually a
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/20">feature request to support 8-digit codes</a> so that limitation might
eventually be fixed as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/186">Google Authenticator people</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/issues/169">Yubikey people</a>
for their support in establishing this procedure.</p>

                        <div><p>Want to build the next billion-dollar gaming company? It's simple, charge nothing. Well, at least up front.</p><p>In today's article, I'd like to explore the growing free-to-play world. We'll take a look at some of the companies that are crushing it, and we'll take some time to explore the free-to-play design patterns that work.</p><p>As always, if you like this article, please let me know. I'd love to hear from readers about what works and what doesn't. I'm on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/ashjanderson">@ashjanderson</a>), and there's a comment section below if you'd prefer to drop a note there.</p><h2 id="the-free-to-play-mega-hits">The Free-to-Play Mega Hits</h2><p>Free-to-play got its start on mobile with mini-games that a user could pay to advance quicker in (usually timers or a lack of lives slowed down progress). Over time, however, free-to-play has grown to be everywhere.</p><p>From Fortnite to Rocket League, to Destiny 2, and Zynga's slate of titles, free-to-play is here to stay. Free-to-play is also growing in prevalence, and many of today's most popular titles are free-to-play. </p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/MostViewers_Twitch.png" alt="Most Viewers Twitch" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/MostViewers_Twitch.png 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/MostViewers_Twitch.png 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/MostViewers_Twitch.png 1167w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Most Viewers Twitch</figcaption></figure><p>Take, for instance, the games with the most viewers on Twitch. League of Legends tops the list, a free-to-play title. Among Us, it's free on iOS and Android, that's in the top five too. Running through the rest of the top 10, at the time of writing, another three games are free, bringing the total to five (League of Legends, Among Us, Call of Duty: MW (Warzone), Fortnite, and CS:GO).</p><p>An even larger share of the most streamed games are free-to-play. Warzone, Fortnite, League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Among Us, Apex and VALORANT all appear in the top ten.</p><p>Even if you're not an avid gamer, you've likely played a few of these. Some, like League of Legends, have been out for the better part of a decade. Call of Duty: Warzone is built upon the back of one of gaming's largest franchises, and Fortnite... well, I probably don't need to tell you what a sensation that has been over the last few years.</p><h2 id="how-much-money-do-these-mega-hits-make">How Much Money Do These Mega Hits Make?</h2><p>Sure, they're played a lot, but is it turning into revenue? Absolutely. Let's use Fortnite as an example here. It is, after all, the most discussed game in the free-to-play ecosphere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/SensorTowerGameRevenue.jpg" alt="SensorTower game revenue" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/SensorTowerGameRevenue.jpg 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/SensorTowerGameRevenue.jpg 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/SensorTowerGameRevenue.jpg 1450w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/fortnite-mobile-first-month">SensorTower</a> game revenue</figcaption></figure><p>Fortnite, despite seeming much older, made its debut (available to all) in April of 2018. In those early days, the game <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/fortnite-mobile-first-month">grossed over $1M a day</a> and has continues up from those astonishing levels. Alas, it was called a fad, and obituaries to the game are seemingly written on a weekly basis.</p><p>Still, according to <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/2019-year-in-review/">SuperData</a>, this completely free-to-play title brought in a whopping $1.8B in revenue for 2019. That's $1.8B on cosmetic items because there's no pay-to-win in Fortnite (a heads up if you're a parent reading this: your child doesn't actually need the credit card to play).</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Superdata-Top-free-to-play-2019.png" alt="Superdata Top Free-to-Play 2019" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Superdata-Top-free-to-play-2019.png 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Superdata-Top-free-to-play-2019.png 753w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Superdata Top Free-to-Play 2019</figcaption></figure><p>In the same SuperData report, the researchers further pointed out that the top ten titles in 2019 all raked in more than a billion dollars in revenue. Remember Candy Crush? It's not dead, it's still pulling down billions a year ($1.5B in 2019) for its parent company, Activision. <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/candy-crush-friends-saga-200-million-revenue">Candy Crush has also reportedly crossed the $1B mark in 2020 too</a>.</p><p>Speaking of Activision, the company may also have found the keys to the free-to-play kingdom over the last year with Warzone and Call of Duty: Mobile. <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/call-of-duty-mobile-250-million-downloads">According to SensorTower, Call of Duty: Mobile is the largest mobile release of all time with over 250M downloads in its first 265 days.</a></p><p>COD: Mobile has now grossed over $500M and it has yet to make its debut in China. See, the game was built in partnership with tech conglomerate, Tencent. Tencent garners games easier access to a notoriously difficult Chinese market. That market, however, is one of the richest for mobile games, so COD: Mobile is likely another big hit in the Activision mobile games stable.</p><h2 id="monetization-strategies">Monetization Strategies</h2><p>I wanted to talk about the different monetization strategies we see across games that are free-to-play. Gaming companies typically employ teams of people to determine the particular strategy their game will utilize, but we've come to see some very common patterns in recent years.</p><p>First and foremost, free-to-play <strong>needs</strong> to be pay-to-enhance and absolutely not pay-to-win. Sure, some strategies may make winning a little easier, but taking away the player's sense of completion is a quick path to app deletion.</p><p>So, what is "pay-to-enhance?" We've seen it take several forms, but most common are cosmetic, speed, and power-ups. Loot boxes are also fairly common, albeit a bit on the "frowned upon" side of things. Finally, to round out the article, we'll take a look at a rather unique game, Pokemon Go and its monetization strategy.</p><p><strong>Cosmetic Games</strong></p><p>Why not start with one of the year's biggest hits, Call of Duty: Warzone. Warzone is a free-to-play portion of last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The game features a single, very large, map where players drop in (150 of them) until a single player (or team) is left standing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Package.png" alt="Call of Duty: Warzone package sale screen" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Package.png 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Package.png 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Package.png 1600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Package.png 1869w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Call of Duty: Warzone package sale screen</figcaption></figure><p>The game is cross-platform and has garnered the attention of many. As you can probably tell by the heading of this particular sub-section, Warzone is monetized by selling cosmetic items. This includes skins for the character, weapon skins, vehicle skins, and in-game music. While there are "blueprints" of guns that can also be bought, I would not consider these an enhancing mechanic as other players could find or build similar weapons.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/BattlePass.png" alt="Call of Duty: Warzone - Battle Pass" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/BattlePass.png 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/BattlePass.png 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/BattlePass.png 1600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/BattlePass.png 1745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Call of Duty: Warzone - Battle Pass</figcaption></figure><p>Call of Duty, and similar games (Fortnite, Rocket League) also makes use of a Battle Pass. This pass grants the user access to more unlocks throughout the season. Players can buy these at any point during the season and will get backwards unlocks of all Battle Pass content they skipped over. Seeing what they may have missed adds that desire to buy.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/FREE-CONTENT.png" alt="Call of Duty: Warzone - Free Content" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/FREE-CONTENT.png 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/FREE-CONTENT.png 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/FREE-CONTENT.png 1600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/FREE-CONTENT.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Call of Duty: Warzone - Free Content</figcaption></figure><p>You can see that in action in the screenshot above. Some items are labeled "FREE" and I will get these even if I spend nothing on the game. Those not listed as "FREE" will be unlocked as I gain XP from playing throughout the season.</p><p><strong>Speed Games</strong></p><p>With cosmetic out of the way, let's now turn to mechanics that alter the gameplay. Some free-to-play titles utilize a speed-based mechanic, typically in conjunction with power ups (covered next).</p><p>These types of games usually entail building something. The game enforces a time to build that object and you can return when it's done to reap your rewards. Alternatively, you can pay to speed-boost certain aspects. It might be to build a particular category of building faster, it might even be to grow a resource quicker for the next thirty minutes.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDaySplash.jpg" alt="Hay Day Splash Screen - Supercell" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/HayDaySplash.jpg 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/HayDaySplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDaySplash.jpg 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hay Day Splash Screen - Supercell</figcaption></figure><p>A developer that has made good use of this category is Supercell. The game we're going to discuss, pictured above, is Hay Day. Hay Day is a farming simulator, much like Farmville, a Zynga title. You can plant crops, build farm buildings, and sell your wares to friends connected via Facebook.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_0185.PNG" alt="Hay Day Seeds Need Time Prompt" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_0185.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/IMG_0185.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_0185.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hay Day Seeds Need Time Prompt</figcaption></figure><p>As soon as the game starts, you're conditioned to know that things take time. Your first wheat crops? Better come back in two minutes once they're ready to be harvested. Luckily, the game distracts you from that first two minutes by helping you make the farm your own. By the time you complete a few painting tasks and buy your first chickens, your wheat is ready to be harvested and planted anew.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDay_Speed_It_Up.PNG" alt="Hay Day Speed It Up Prompt" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/HayDay_Speed_It_Up.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/HayDay_Speed_It_Up.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDay_Speed_It_Up.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hay Day Speed It Up Prompt</figcaption></figure><p>The chickens is where the games' monetization mechanics are first introduced. We can see that it'll take 20 minutes for our eggs to be ready, but our friendly scarecrow is giving us a (free, for now) way to speed things up, just double click the diamond.</p><p>Therein lies the crux of the speed-up monetization tactic. Sure, things are quick in the beginning. You have two minutes to harvest wheat, 20 minutes to collect eggs, but as you advance and become more connected to your farm the task length grows.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDay_Diamonds.PNG" alt="Hay Day Diamonds For Sale" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/HayDay_Diamonds.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/HayDay_Diamonds.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/HayDay_Diamonds.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hay Day Diamonds For Sale</figcaption></figure><p>By the time you reach level 15, you can create and sell a pumpkin pie. That pie takes two hours to complete, but it requires three pumpkins (3hr each) and a few other ingredients. That's a full day of work right there. Not to worry, you can speed the whole thing up with a bag of diamonds starting at $1.99.</p><p>Diamonds in Hay Day can be used for a variety of tasks outside of speeding things up, but the speed is a core component of this game. Games that involve building of any kind are best suited to this tactic.</p><p><strong>Power Up Games</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_splash_screen.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Wildscapes_splash_screen.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Wildscapes_splash_screen.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_splash_screen.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When I say power up, one particular game type comes to mind right away, match 3. Zynga have a lot of titles in this category, as does Playrix, a company that has taken match 3 games all the way to a billion dollar business. For our example, we'll use a Playrix title, Wildscapes, a game that allows you to build your own zoo.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_needs_coins.PNG" alt="Wildscapes coin prompt" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Wildscapes_needs_coins.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Wildscapes_needs_coins.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_needs_coins.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Wildscapes coin prompt</figcaption></figure><p>Right off the bat, this game presents its main mechanic you need coins to buy and build objects in your zoo. Better jump right into our first game of match 3! The first level, as expected, is pretty much solved for you to give you an err of success.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes-Power-Up.PNG" alt="Wildscapes Power-Up" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Wildscapes-Power-Up.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Wildscapes-Power-Up.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes-Power-Up.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Wildscapes Power-Up</figcaption></figure><p>In level 2, we're given our first look at a power up. Match four items together, and you'll get a special piece, match five and it's even better. As the levels go on, the difficulty increases. Some levels may seem impossible to finish, and that's where the need to buy power ups can come into play for some players.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_Sale_page.PNG" alt="Wildscapes Sale Page" srcset="https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Wildscapes_Sale_page.PNG 600w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Wildscapes_Sale_page.PNG 1000w, https://www.stooge.io/content/images/2020/10/Wildscapes_Sale_page.PNG 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Wildscapes Sale Page</figcaption></figure><p>Playrix games combine power ups and gems. By bundling like this, a game can be seen to be offering more bang for the user's buck. After all, this industry is all about building perceived value, and by offering bundles, value can become more apparent to the player.</p><p>Let's dive into this …</p></div></section></article></div>

<div>
<p>People sometimes have weird ideas. This was definitely one of them. I didn’t even set out to build a LEGO map of New Zealand…it just happened.</p>



<p>In January this year I was working on something completely unrelated, based on a quick map I did a bit earlier. I had created a map in Tableau but reached the limits of the tool and was looking for something else. Very quickly it became obvious that QGIS would be the tool of choice for what I wanted to do. I cannot remember the details but at the same time I figured that my original viz looked a little bit like LEGO – and there it was.</p>



<p>With the #30DayMapChallenge just finished, I had seen a bunch of LEGO style maps but it sounded like an interesting idea to build an actual map in LEGO.</p>



<p>I also thought that I had seen a map in LEGO before. A quick search brought up <a href="https://dirks-blog.tumblr.com/LEGO-world-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dirk’s world map in LEGO</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

</div></figure>
</div>
</div>



<h2>The Planning</h2>



<p>The first thing I realised was that QGIS was way clunkier than I would have hoped for; that paired with my close to non-existent knowledge about GIS tools caused some frustration. I knew what I wanted to do but I didn’t know the terminology to look for help. </p>



<p>It took me 10-15 hours over a weekend to figure out the basics and to get to a point where I had a first draft of an elevation raster for New Zealand. At that point I definitely jumped the gun (more on that later) when I started building the whole model in LEGO stud.io, a piece of software that lets you build virtual LEGO models. </p>



<p>The benefit of actually building something was that I ran into a bunch of questions I hadn’t thought of before. A 2 dimensional version is rather simple, with a third dimension I needed to think about how I want to layer the different colours. How do I make the whole thing stable? Do I start on the lowest layer and build up or do I have my baseline in the middle and build down and up? And how the hell would I hang it on a wall once it’s done? </p>



<p>I got in touch with Dirk who build the world map and he happily answered some of those and a bunch more questions. By the time I felt like I knew how I wanted to do it, I didn’t like my initial QGIS work any longer though..</p>

The third one ended up being the basis for the physical map</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The Questioning</h2>



<p>I’m a data person, which probably doesn’t come as a big surprise…This project is a data visualisation of sorts and to be happy with it, I had to be confident it represents the data in a way that makes sense; to me and any other audience. </p>



<p>So let’s see:</p>



<p><strong>Scale:</strong> Each stud (the technical term for one LEGO square) represents 10km in the real world. This results in a scale of  1:1250000. I am happy with this, although I did create patterns for 12km and 15km squares because I questioned whether 10km would fit on our wall…In the end I did it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Colour palette:</strong> This was basically just verifying that Dirk’s work would work for me. The colours are a version of a standard colour scheme for elevation maps, which go from green to yellow to brown and white. Although there are discussion about how suitable that is (low areas do not always have green vegetation, etc.) I think that most people will be able to relate to it. Also, the colours Dirk chose are some of the more common LEGO colours which helped keeping the whole project within “a” budget. (more on that later as well).</p>



<p><strong>Elevation value:</strong> Since each square needs one colour, I have to find one elevation value that represents that value. I started with the median of all values within a 10×10 square. The problem with this was that it ignores outliers (as medians do). I needed to have Mt. Cook (the highest peak in NZ) visible on the map and if I used the median, it wouldn’t show up. It would also “blur” everything so that there wasn’t a lot of difference in elevation. I tried the maximum value in each square and that worked better. It made the high peaks visible but neglected the deep valleys that exist on the South Island. I ended up going through it manually to adjust values. This helped to make for example Arthur’s Pass visible and made Marlborough Sound look more like a sound.</p>



<p><strong>Elevation bins:</strong> This one was the most technical problem and one I didn’t find a clear answer for. I had my colours defined by how do I ramp them to 1. not break any mapping rules and 2. have the elevation represented in a relatable way. If I create equal bins based on percentiles, all high peaks disappear. If I divide the range of elevation by the number of bins, all the lower elevations blur into one. I ended up manually defining them as 0m-250m, 250m-500m, 500m-1000m and then 500m steps. This worked well to give a good impression of the NZ landscape.</p>



<p>This whole process actually took the longest time. I build 3 different base maps for 3 different scales, researched mapping best practise and still learned how to use QGIS but eventually I settled on something I was happy with</p>



<h2>The (virtual) Build</h2>



<div>
<div>
<p>Projects like these, are only possible because somebody put in a lot of leg work before. Stud.io s a virtual LEGO builder, which has (virtually) every brick every produced by LEGO and all of the possible colours. You pick a brick one by one and stack them on top of each other to build whatever you desire. It then integrates with bricklink.com, an online marketplace where people sell their LEGO brick by brick, so once the model is finished, it only takes a few clicks to order the bricks you need (in theory!).</p>



<p>In total I built my map around 3 times virtually. I got quicker with each time but it’s still a ton of work! For my first build, I had no regard for the economy of LEGO. Since it’s a marketplace, there is supply and demand and since it’s not run by LEGO themselves (well, nowadays it is, since they bought bricklink) there is limited supply. You can buy single bricks for $20 if they were only produced for one set or you get them for a few cents. Also, some bricks just don’t exist in a certain colour. </p>



<p>I also wasn’t quite sure how to layer the bricks to get the land to actually elevate. I could have just layered LEGO plates in each colour on top of each other. While this would have been the most stable way, it also was likely to get much more expensive. I decided to mix between plates and bricks, which also allowed me to use cheaper colours as a filling under the actual colours. So I ended up getting a lot of red and white bricks which are not visible at all, just because it was more economic.</p>



<p>With each build I got more sophisticated and for the last one, I had a table with all the bricks I might need, their average price on bricklink and the average price per stud. You can imagine that buying eight 1×1 bricks is probably more expensive than one 2×4 brick. After a lot of manual sifting through the bricklink catalogue I created a palette with the bricks that I found affordable and started building.</p>

<h2>The Order</h2>



<p>Now I said Stud.io integrates with bricklink, which means I can export the list of parts I used and order them on the website. Bricklink even offers to go through all available shops and pick the cheapest parts. However it does not take into account shipping fees and/or thresholds after which shipping is free. Also, in New Zealand there is limited amount of shops available. I can’t complain but especially larger orders of more obscure parts can get either very expensive or they might not have the necessary quantity available. I spent another 10-15 hours structuring my order to consolidate them in as few orders as possible to reduce shipping cost and to take advantage of cheaper prices where possible. Since my family is in Germany, I also had the option to place several orders in Europe, pay for local shipping and then have my family send them over in bulk, which made the shipping much cheaper. In total, all of this probably made a ~500NZD difference at the end. I am quite certain that I could have reduced the price further had I realised that the automatic conversion from Euro to NZD might not have been in my favour…</p>



<p>Anyway, I order around 3800 bricks in 12 orders. Following that, some of the stores didn’t have all the bricks in their inventory and I had to source them somewhere else AND the whole world struggled with COVID19, so even though my family sent the bricks before most of the flights where canned and countries went into lock-down, I wasn’t sure I would receive all the bricks any time soon.</p>



<h2>The (physical) Build</h2>



<p>Turns out I didn’t have to worry and my bricks were delivered in a reasonable timeframe. I spent some time sorting everything by colour to make it easier for myself, then I set myself up in the spare bedroom and started building. It turned out it was easier than I thought. I had to work around a few errors in my digital models which was fine and I even ended up with a bunch of spare bricks (at the same time I was missing a bunch of bricks that I thought would have been included in my orders).</p>



<p>Now I have a 7.8kg LEGO map in my spare bedroom that waits for the lock down to end so that I can buy material to hang it in my living room.</p>

<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Hours of work</td><td><strong>~100 hrs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Number of bricks</td><td><strong>~3800 bricks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td><strong>90cm x 128cm x 3.3cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td><strong>7.8 kg</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td> <strong>1:1250000 </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

    <p>In my previous article about <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the number of built-in apps in iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Several readers asked if I could provide a percentage rather than an absolute number.</p>
<p>In this new article, I will answer this question by measuring the total number of binaries in iOS. I will go one step further and also count the number of binaries using other programming languages: Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Finally to be as complete as possible, I ran this analysis on all major iOS releases, from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14. This will provide a detailed overview of the evolution of the different programming languages over more than a decade of iOS development.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the analysis, let's clarify the scope. First I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares (SecureROM, Baseband, …) are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a cache mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 and still used in iOS&nbsp;14.</p>
<p>Another point is that you may note the absence of Objective-C++. The approach I used can't really detect binaries using Objective-C++. So I counted such binaries as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
<p>Finally you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations due to the simple fact that I don't have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>

<p>The first problem to tackle was to count the number of binaries in iOS. Because I ran the analyses off‑device, I could not rely on the permissions being properly set.</p>
<p>Instead I used the fact that a binary has to be a Mach-O file to be executable. Checking if a file is a Mach-O binary is trivial by using the <code>file</code> command line tool in a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function to check if a file (passed as argument $1) is an executable
# It returns the number of occurrences of the string 'Mach-O' returned by
# the output of the file command. File would generally return a line like
# - Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e (/usr/bin/sysdiagnose)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64e (/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib)
# - Mach-O 64-bit bundle arm64e (/usr/lib/xpc/support.bundle/support)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamic linker arm64e (/usr/lib/dyld)
# - Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle arm64e (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext/AppleIDV)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library stub arm64e (/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/libMobileGestalt.dylib)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
isExecutable ()
{
	file $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o "Mach-O" | wc -l
}
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this script through all the files of each major iOS release to count the number of binaries and to obtain the evolution over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/Binaries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 contained quite a small amount of binaries. But iOS has become more and more complex and iOS&nbsp;14.0 now contains 20 times more binaries than iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0.</p>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the built-in apps using Swift and SwiftUI. For this article I decided to go one step further and also count the number of binaries using Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can mix different programming languages to create a binary. One example is to create an app that uses C++ for the low-level engine and Objective-C for the UI. Another good example is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> where I use some code written in Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C and C, the most appropriate programming languages being used to solve each specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swiftui">Detecting SwiftUI</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">previous post</a>, I explained how to detect if a binary uses SwiftUI by checking if it dynamically links against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>. This can be implemented in a Bash script like:</p>
<pre><code>isSwiftUI=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI\.framework/SwiftUI" | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<p>Although SwiftUI is not really a programming language but rather an user interface toolkit, I decided to include it in this article.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swift">Detecting Swift</h2>
<p>Detecting the use of Swift can be done using a similar method, as <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">described in an older post in 2016</a>. The script is however slightly more complex due to the fact that the Swift libraries have been moved to different locations during the history of iOS:</p>
<pre><code>isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/swift/" | wc -l )
if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ]
then
	# On iOS 11, the Swift dylib were inside "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/"
	isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/" | wc -l )
	
	if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ] &amp;&amp; [[ $1 != */libswiftUIKit.dylib ]]
	then
		# On iOS 9, the Swift dylib were built into the app
		isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "@rpath/libswiftUIKit\.dylib" | wc -l )
	fi
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-objective-c">Detecting Objective-C</h2>
<p>Detecting if a binary uses Objective-C is pretty simple as explained in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Apple's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language, and as such is linked to by all Objective-C apps. Objective-C runtime library support functions are implemented in the shared library found at /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple line can thus detect all apps using Objective-C:</p>
<pre><code>isObjectiveC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libobjc\." | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c">Detecting C++</h2>
<p>Similarly to Objective-C, we can rely on the fact that apps using C++ have to use the C++ standard library. On modern iOS versions, the C++ standard library libc++ is located at <code>/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib</code>. On iOS&nbsp;7 and earlier, the gcc's libstdc++ was used and located at <code>/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why the exact path is not used in the script below, the reason is to mark <code>libc++abi.dylib</code> as using C++. <a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/">libc++abi</a> is the low level support for the standard C++ library and appears to be written in C++.</p>
<pre><code>isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libc++" | wc -l )
if [ ${isCPP} == 0 ]
then
	isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libstdc++" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c-1">Detecting C</h2>
<p>Without entering into complex details, Objective-C and C++ are a superset of C. This means that an Objective-C or C++ app is using C code. So we can't know if an Objective-C or C++ app is using some pure C code. However some apps are written entirely in C. These are generally low-level command line tool, like <code>/usr/bin/zprint</code>.</p>
<p>How to detect such binaries? If a binary doesn't link neither to the Objective-C runtime library nor to the C++ standard library, but uses the standard C library <code>libc</code> located at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>, then we can assume that this binary is entirely written in C. To detect apps entirely written in C, I ended up with these lines:</p>
<pre><code>isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libSystem\." | wc -l )
if [ ${isC} == 0 ]
then
	isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/system/" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that I hardcoded all the dynamic libraries located inside <code>/usr/lib/system/</code> as being written in C. These low-level libraries don't link to <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> but are most likely written in C.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases">Special cases</h2>
<p>In the final script, you will see a couple of special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib</code>:
This library is entirely written in assembly and you can read its arm64 source code in this file <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-781/runtime/objc-blocktramps-arm64.s">objc-blocktramps-arm64.s</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/dyld</code>:
dyld is the dynamic linker and is a really special binary. Since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/">it is open source</a>, we can easily confirm that it contains C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpc/sdk.dylib</code> and <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib</code>:
These 2 libraries seem to be autogenerated libraries and part of dyld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Extensions/*</code>:
There are a couple of (kernel?) extension used by iOS like <code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext</code>. All these binaries appear to use C++.</p>
</li>
</ul>

This script prints the paths of all the binaries found and tells you the programming languages used, like:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/AccountAuthenticationDialog |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/ActivityMessagesApp |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/PlugIns/ActivityMessagesExtension.appex/ActivityMessagesExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/AnimojiStickers |Objective-C
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/PlugIns/AnimojiStickersExtension.appex/AnimojiStickersExtension |Objective-C
/Applications/AppSSOUIService.app/AppSSOUIService |Objective-C
/Applications/AppStore.app/AppStore |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/ProductPageExtension.appex/ProductPageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/SubscribePageExtension.appex/SubscribePageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this script on all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14.0. If you are interested by the raw data, you can download them here:</p>

In fact, even for those who managed to maneuver around&nbsp;it back in high school, logarithm still remains largely as an <em>evasive</em> concept. The <strong>“I-can-manipulate-expressions-without-understanding-anything” syndrome</strong>&nbsp;runs rampant when it comes to logarithm.</p><p>Indeed, here in North America, the&nbsp;grade school curriculum has the propensity of overemphasizing the&nbsp;<strong>mechanics</strong>&nbsp;at the expense of&nbsp;<strong>basic theory</strong>, leaving us with the <em>formidable</em> task of filling in the <em>logarithmic</em> knowledge gap, which includes — among others&nbsp;— the theory behind the <strong>properties of logarithm</strong>, and its intended <strong>computational use</strong> in handling&nbsp;numbers with an&nbsp;<strong>order of magnitude</strong> veering towards the extremes.</p><p>So with that in mind, if you think that the time might have finally come to tame this <em>monster</em> we call logarithm, then it would be our pleasure to congratulate your timing on this very honorable act. And if&nbsp;you are simply looking to&nbsp;explore further into the rabbit hole, that would be <em>doubly</em> appreciated as well, for regardless of your motivation, the <strong>taming</strong>/<strong>musing</strong> is on!&nbsp;&nbsp;🙂<span id="more-5976"></span></p><h2 id="review"><span id="Logarithm_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Logarithm — A Review</a><span></span></h2><h3 id="terms"><span id="Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Terminology</a><span></span></h3><p>Given a <em>real number</em> $x$, one of the challenges in <strong>elementary algebra</strong> is to express $x$ as a <em>power</em> of another number $b$ (known as the <strong>base</strong>). More specifically, we are interested in finding a&nbsp;number $\Box$ such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x = b^\Box \end{equation*}</p><p>As it turns out, this problem — in the <em>crude</em> form that it currently is at least — needs to be patched up first&nbsp;before any meaningful discussion can take place. For example:</p><ul><li>If the base is <em>negative</em>, then its powers need not be necessarily&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined"><strong>well-defined</strong></a> (e.g., $\displaystyle (-e)^{\frac{1}{2}}$).</li><li>If the base is $\displaystyle 1$, then any power of it would be just $1$, in which case, it would be <em>impossible</em>&nbsp;for it to generate any&nbsp;number that’s not $1$. A&nbsp;similar remark applies to the case&nbsp;where&nbsp;the base is equal to $0$.</li></ul><p>For these reasons, in the context of <strong>power determination</strong>, it’s customary to require&nbsp;the&nbsp;base $b$ to be a <em>positive</em> number — that is not equal to $1$. While under this assumption, any power of $b$ would necessarily have to be <em>positive</em>, it would also transpire —under this setup — that <em>any</em>&nbsp;positive number can be expressed as a power of $b$ in a <em>unique</em> way. That is, as long as $x$ is <em>positive</em>, there will be a <em>unique</em> number $\Box$ (known as the&nbsp;<strong>exponent</strong>) such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x= b^{\Box} \end{equation*}</p><p>in which case, we will simply call $\Box$ the <strong>logarithm</strong> of $x$ (in base $b$). In other words, logarithm is basically what happens when we expressed a number as a <em>power</em>, and then take the <em>exponent</em> from that power —&nbsp;It gives&nbsp;us the <strong>magnitude</strong> of a number, with respect to the base in question.</p><p>For example, when we try to express the number $64$ as a power of $2$, we get that $64= 2^6$. This alone shows that $6$ is the logarithm of $64$ — &nbsp;with respect to the base $2$.</p><p>Notation-wise, the logarithm of $x$ in <strong>base</strong> $b$ is denoted by $\log_b x$, with $x$ also being called&nbsp;the <strong>argument</strong> of the logarithm. When considered as a function, $\log_b x$ is defined on all <em>positive</em> numbers — as long as&nbsp;the base $b$ is <strong>valid</strong> (i.e.,&nbsp;&nbsp;$\displaystyle b&gt;0, b \ne 1$) .</p><p>To begin,&nbsp;we first note that <em>regardless</em> of the value of the base $b$, we always have that:</p><ul><li>$\displaystyle \log_b 1 = 0$ (since $0$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $1$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b b&nbsp;= 1$ (since $1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $b$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b \frac{1}{b} = -1$ (since $-1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $\displaystyle \frac{1}{b}$)</li></ul><p>Because these results are almost immediate and sufficiently notable, we’ll simply&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;them as the&nbsp;<strong>trivial logarithmic identities</strong>.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;since $\log_b x$ stands for the number which&nbsp;<em>exponentiates</em> to $x$, we also have that by definition:</p><p>\begin{align*}b^{\log_b x} &amp; = x \qquad (\text{for all }x&gt;0)\end{align*}</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;we also have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \log_b (b^x) = x \qquad (\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}) \end{align*}</p><p>Since one can see by inspection that $x$ is precisely the number which exponentiates to $b^x$.</p><p>For&nbsp;example, since $\displaystyle \log_2 53$ is the number that $2$ needs to raise to yield $53$, we have that $\displaystyle 2^{\log_2 53} =53$. Similarly, since $\displaystyle 10^{-\pi}$ is a power of $10$ with the exponent $-\pi$, we can infer&nbsp;that $\displaystyle \log_{10} \left(10^{-\pi}\right) = -\pi$.</p><h3 id="10"><span id="Common_Logarithm_(Base_10)"></span><a href="#toc">Common Logarithm (Base 10)</a><span></span></h3><p>Being the inverse of the exponential function $\displaystyle 10^x$, the base-$10$ logarithmic function — also known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>common logarithm</strong></a> — is customarily denoted by $\log_{10} x$, $\log x$, or simply $\lg x$ for short. The common logarithm is of great interest to us, primarily&nbsp;due to the prevalence of the&nbsp;<strong>decimal number system</strong> in various cultures around the world.</p><div><p><strong>Caution</strong></p><p>Note that in older scientific texts and some textbooks in higher mathematics, $\log x$ can also refer to — and usually is — the <a href="#e">natural logarithm of base $e$</a>.</p></div><p>When the common logarithm of a number is calculated, the&nbsp;<em>decimal representation</em> of the logarithm is usually split into two parts: the integer component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>characteristic</strong>) and the fractional component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>mantissa</strong>). The characteristic in essence tells us &nbsp;the <strong>number of digits</strong> the original number has, and the mantissa hints at the extent to which this&nbsp;number is close to its next power of $10$. These are the facts that make common logarithm a&nbsp;particularly handy tool in determining the <strong>order of magnitude</strong> of an <em>exceptionally&nbsp;large</em> (or <em>small</em>) number.</p><p>For example, to figure out the magnitude of the number $50!$ (i.e., $50 \times \cdots \times 1$), we proceed to calculate its logarithm, yielding that: \[ \log (50!) \approx 64.483 \] which means that $50! \approx 10^{64.483} =$ $10^{64}10^{0.483} \approx$ $10^{64} \cdot 3.04$, suggesting that $50!$ is a $65$<em>-digit number</em> which starts with $3$ — the <strong>characteristic</strong> $64$ gives away the number of digits, and the <strong>mantissa</strong> $0.483$ reveals&nbsp;the rest about the number itself.</p><p>Take home message?

        <blockquote><p>Experienced programmers have tales to tell about the things they had to do to test and debug their applications. They agree on one thing: The bad ol’ days of development are best left in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d been typing my code into a Model 33 teletype keyboard for a while, and I was anxious to see if my application worked. The teletype was attached to a General Electric model 225 computer located at Dartmouth College. The language that I was using, late in the summer of 1964, was <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>I typed “RUN” and almost immediately the printer came to life. “WHAT?” it said. I printed out the program code and found what I thought might be a mistake. I typed in the code again (I hadn’t yet discovered the <code>OLD</code> command), typed <code>RUN</code>, and waited. Seconds later, I got the response. “WHAT?” the printer said. Somebody at GE apparently decided that I’d wasted enough of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/nets/timesharing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their time-share time</a>, because I never got another chance.</p>
<p>But what I <em>did</em> experience was the challenge of debugging software, especially in the old days when QA tools didn’t exist, there was little help because almost no one at the time had ever written a program in BASIC, and I didn’t really know what I was doing anyway.</p>
<p>Other languages were similarly limited. When I managed programmers in a COBOL shop years later, debugging consisted of creating vastly long print-outs, taping them to the walls, and documenting the program flow with colored pencils. It was during one such session in the mid-1980s when an unhappy voice from the back of the room began excoriating me for using COBOL.</p>
<p>Standing there, petite and trim, was an elderly Admiral who was clearly not impressed. “You should be using C,” <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/grace-murray-hopper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Admiral Grace Hopper</a> told me. Admiral Hopper, who designed FLOW-MATIC, the immediate precursor to COBOL, clearly didn’t think her work was the right answer to serving the military. She was right, of course, but I didn’t have the appropriation to pay for changes.</p>
<h3>Printfs and other joys</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">debugging and testing</a> software was like that even at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Depending on the language and the application, developers usually had to create their own tools in order to determine what a program was doing as it executed. There were some exceptions, such as the <a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Consumer/Archive-Byte-IDX/IDX/80s/88-90/Byte-1990-Vol-15-No-11-Fall-OCR-Page-0250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware-assisted debuggers from Periscope</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And debuggers like the one built into the <a href="http://www.aztecmuseum.ca/intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manx Aztec C compiler</a> could generate symbol tables that could be fed into SID, a debugger from Digital Research for CP/M-80. But each of the early testing tools required brute-force effort, such as setting breakpoints, running step-by-step at the source code level, and dumping the call stack.</p>
<p>Finding out when loops worked as intended and exited when they were supposed to sometimes meant embedding errors at specific points in the code; the crash and subsequent memory dump would show the state of execution at the time.</p>
<p>“This then allowed the programmer to examine all aspects of the program at a point in time,” says zOS programmer Mark Jacobs discussing software debugging in the old days.</p>
<p>Bruce Marold, now retired, once worked in software development. He had similar experiences working on a Fortran IV project. “My first major software project was on a timesharing Fortran IV on a teletype with no debugging resources at all. Even worse, Fortran seemed to be aggressively non-modular. Sometimes GOTO was unavoidable. I had to use brute force to locate glitches.” Marold had to calculate results in the biostatistical application by hand to verify that his program was getting the right answer.</p>
<p>There were other approaches. Some programmers embedded printf commands in their code to stop execution so they could examine the state of the machine – and many still do! Farther back, programmers would single-step through a program, watching indicator lights on the computer’s front panel to follow program execution.</p>
<p>George Dinwiddie, an independent software development consultant, tells of having to build his own circuit emulator. “Every time I had to edit code, I had to burn new <a href="https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/input-output-and-memory/eprom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPROMs</a>,” Dinwiddie said. “I made an emulator to avoid that. The next week, instead of doing four iterations of finding a problem and editing code, I was able to do a couple dozen because I didn’t have to burn EPROMs.”</p>
<h3>An entire herd of yaks to shave</h3>
<p>QA testing is hard enough, but in earlier eras, developers and testers had little debugging support. Developers had to create their own testing methods and debugging tools, <a href="https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which consumed more time</a>. Plus, a lack of common test methods and procedures hurt accuracy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things have changed. Perhaps the biggest change is the idea that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-importance-of-planning-your-tests/">developers should plan for testing</a> in the first place. “Figuring out how you’re going to test before you build it is a huge advance,” says Dinwiddie. “With software you can build in tests.”</p>
<p>Preparing for testing leads to the ability to automate testing. “When I got the idea of ‘test first,’ in 2000, it really changed the way I thought about creating software,” Dinwiddie says. “Instead of seeing if it worked, I changed to the idea of asking the code to do what I wanted it to do.” Now he can worry about what he wants to accomplish, and then perform testing in little steps.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”—Brian W. Kernighan</p></blockquote>
<p>“The most significant difference between software testing in the past and present is the <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">reliance on automated testing</a>,” says Yaniv Masjedi, CMO of <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>, a voice-over-internet-protocol company. “The perception that manual testing is more accurate and gives fewer errors is an obsolete concept of the past. Modern testing software can provide the same output at a much faster pace without compromising test quality.”</p>
<p>Mostly, testing took longer – which meant it was slower to roll out new versions. “In the past, software testing was slower because it involved testing the software with little historical data and limited technology to automate tests,” says Denis Leclair, VP engineering at Trellis. Testing takes time today because historical data can predict possible outcomes. “It is now possible to automate software tests, which reduces the time spent overall in the software testing process,” he adds.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that some older aspects of testing aren’t still useful. “In the past, there were <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">more interactions between members of the software testing process</a>, and these regular meetings develop many innovative strategies to test software,” says Leclair. “If applied today, software testing will see significant developments based on constant knowledge sharing.”</p>
<p>While there is some nostalgia for the challenges of the good ol’ days, developers acknowledge that software development and testing has improved – not the least of which is hiring dedicated QA staff rather than waiting for users to file bug reports.</p>
<p>Of course most testing today avoids the intellectual team-building that happened while developers tried to figure out why their applications failed. That’s not all gone. Instead, those challenges have moved to designing reliable, mostly automated, testing. There may be less drama that way, but the result is a better product.</p>
<blockquote><p>Naturally, at Functionize we think we offer a better path for anyone who wants to test software, automate test suites, and ensure application quality. Won’t you take a few minutes to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/test-creation/">explore its features</a> and learn more?</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Fake reviews garner much attention and controversy worldwide. It is <em>the</em> primary reason Fakespot was created. Fakespot was launched after I was scammed on Amazon with a product that had hundreds of fake reviews.</p>

<p>When reading the reviews for this product, it was obvious that the seller had implanted fake reviews with the use of bots, spiced up with some human input. The product was freshly launched and it had <em>hundreds of 5 star reviews</em> in a matter of hours for a completely no name brand!</p>

<p>I was already familiar with black hat techniques fraudsters use to increase their listings’ rankings due to my security background, a passion I developed in my early teenage years. In case you were wondering… Yes, I was a hacker.</p>

<p>At the age of 18, I submitted my first bug bounties to the Zero Day Initiative, a pioneer of the bug bounty programs when there were none. The first vulnerability I discovered was a <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong> buffer overflow. My research later lead me to finding bugs in software ranging from <strong>Adobe PDF Reader</strong>, <strong>WinAmp</strong>, <strong>Foxit</strong>, <strong>VLC Player</strong> to some more <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<em>check out my publicly published vulnerabilities/exploits <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/search?e_author=skd">here</a> if you’re curious</em>).</p>

  <figcaption>The Metasploit module for the PowerPoint vulnerability I found way back in the day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><em>Funny story: I applied for a Microsoft internship at the time I received the payout for the bug bounty. Back in those days, Microsoft was notorious for “hating” on anyone who would find weaknesses in their products especially security researchers. Needless to say, they immediately rejected my application. It just shows how much Microsoft has changed since then.</em></p>

<p>My love for security has taught me that, reverse engineering to the lowest level is always critical. Especially, if you want to understand the fundamentals and scope to the problem you are encountering. That mindset helped me discover a completely different class of vulnerabilities altogether, the social context vulnerabilities in eCommerce: <strong>fake reviews</strong> and many others.</p>

<p>Fakespot was initially built to automate the process of analyzing the trustworthiness of reviews. After all, who has hours of free time to dissect and verify the reviews they’re reading? Since the launch of Fakespot in 2015, the state of fake reviews and eCommerce fraud has emerged and evolved in ways that I wouldn’t have imagined.</p>

<p>Before diving in to fake reviews and eCommerce fraud, let’s talk about eCommerce and take a look at the total volume and growth of sales:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://saoudkhalifah.com/assets/img/shopify_sales_graph.png" alt="eCommerce past years growth and forecast for 2021 - Source: Shopify"></p>
  <figcaption>eCommerce past years growth and forecast for 2021 - Source: Shopify</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>eCommerce sales are forecast to be close to <em>$4 trillion dollars</em> this year. That is <em>nearly 20%</em> of the GDP for the United States in 2019 alone. These numbers are astonishing and showcase the vast opportunities in eCommerce.</p>

<p>More and more sales happen online in the year of 2020. We can only see eCommerce gobbling up even more sales from brick and mortal retail as consumers work from home in quarantine. This is indeed the era of the <em>digital gold rush</em>. <strong>Make no mistake, it also the era of the digital Wild West.</strong></p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://saoudkhalifah.com/assets/img/wild_west_meme.jpg" alt="That's the truth, Clint."></p>
  <figcaption>That’s the truth, Clint.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s dive into trends we see with fake reviews.</p>

<p>Fakespot has analyzed over <strong>8 billion reviews</strong>, <strong>1 billion reviewers</strong> and served over <strong>20 million users</strong> visiting <strong>fakespot.com</strong>. From our analysis, we can clearly understand the trends that show the increase in fraud over the last 3 years with each month in comparison:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://saoudkhalifah.com/assets/img/fakespot_avg_graph.png" alt="The monthly average of analyses that had >= 30% unreliable reviews - Source: Fakespot"></p>
  <figcaption>The monthly average of analyses that had &gt;= 30% unreliable reviews - Source: Fakespot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The data unveils the whole story for the trend of fake reviews. We have comparable rises each year in the amount of unreliable reviews.</p>

<p>Specifically, the averages from March 2020 to August 2020 reached <strong>record numbers never seen before</strong>. This sequence of increases would only occur in Black Friday and Christmas shopping seasons of prior years. Sellers are quoted as saying “It was Black Friday everyday” <a href="https://mashable.com/article/people-shopping-more-coronavirus/">[1]</a> and we all experienced the widespread stock depletion on Amazon and other platforms.</p>

<p>Let’s also take note that in September 2020 Amazon significantly <strong>purged</strong>, albeit in a delayed fashion, a large chunk of fake reviews to move it down from the <strong>43.75%</strong> average we see in August. Likely, in preparation for Prime Day and the impending holiday shopping season.</p>

<p>This year is quite different, <em>to say the least</em>.</p>

<p>As the majority of the world went into lockdown the importance of reviews increases for sellers and consumers alike. We shop online, unable to judge the product by touching, feeling and physically testing it. Thus, we heavily rely on the opinions of others that have purchased the product. <strong>I believe one of the great innovations of the Internet is shared knowledge, and reviews are a conduit of that.</strong> Unfortunately, sellers also know that reviews can make or break their sales and they are abusing that to the maximum for their advantage.</p>

<p>This overview of the general trends is useful in understanding the scale of eCommerce fraud. Fake reviews and the fraud surrounding eCommerce is extensive, complex and deep. To go through all the topics requires a sequence of posts with this being the first one.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-processing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-processing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            
                            

<p>When I realized that I cannot apply common image processing pipelines in medical images, I was completely discouraged. Why does such functionality not exist? So, I made up this post for discouraged individuals who, like me, are interested in solving medical imaging problems.</p>

<p>We have already discussed medical image segmentation and some initial background on <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">coordinate systems </a>and DICOM files. My experience in the field leads me to continue with data understanding, preprocessing, and some augmentations. As I always say, if you merely understand your data and their particularities, you are probably playing bingo. In the field of medical imaging, I find some data manipulations, which are heavily used in preprocessing and augmentation in state-of-the-art methods, to be critical in our understanding. To this end, I provide a notebook for everyone to play around. It performs transformations on medical images, which is simply a 3D structured grid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The accompanying notebook on google colab can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fyU_YaZUO3B5qVzBJwGoYZ6XVvVLog30?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Data</strong>: We will play with 2 MRI images that are provided from nibabel (python library) for illustration purposes. The images are stored as nifty files. But before that, let’s write up some code to visualize the 3D medical volumes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The images will be shown in 3 planes: sagittal, coronal, axial looking from left to right throughout this post.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole tutorial, we will extensively use a function that visualizes the three median slices in the <strong>sagittal, coronal, and axial</strong> planes respectively. Let’s write some minimal function to do so:</p>

<p>Nothing more than matplotlib’s “<code>imshow"</code> and numpy’s array manipulations. For the record, medical images are a single channel and we visualize them in grayscale colors.</p>

<p>The two images that we will use to play with a plethora of transformations can be illustrated below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>show_mid_slice</span><span>(</span><span>epi_img_numpy</span><span>,</span> <span>'first image'</span><span>)</span>

<em>The initial brain MRI images that we will use.</em></p>

<p>Now we are good to go! Let’s commence with resize and rescale in medical images. Yeap, it’s not exactly the same.</p>

<h2 id="1-medical-image-resizing-downup-sampling">1. Medical image resizing (down/up-sampling)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scipy</a> library provides a lot of functionalities for multi-dimensional images. Since medical images are three dimensional, a lot of functionalities can be used. This time we will use <strong>scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom</strong> for resizing the image in the desired dimensions. This is similar to downsampling in a 2D image. The same function can be used for interpolation to increase the spatial dimensions. As an illustration, we will double and half the original image size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that in this kind of transformation the ratios are usually important to be maintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably don’t want to lose the anatomy of the human body :)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>scipy</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This kind of scaling is usually called isometric. Honestly, I am not a big fan of the scipy’s terminology to use the word zoom for this functionality.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-image-processing/resized-mri-images.png" alt="resized-mri-images">
<em>Downsampled and upsampled image by a factor of 2</em></p>

<p>It is very common to downsample the image in a lower dimension for heavy machine learning.</p>

<p>Note that there is another type of resizing. Instead of providing the desired output shape, you specify the desired voxel size(i.e. voxel_size=(1,1,1) mm). Nibabel provides a function called resample_to_output(). It works with nifti files and not with numpy arrays. Honestly, I wouldn’t recommend it alone since the resulting images might not have the same shape. This may be a problem for deep learning. For example to create batches with dataloaders the dimension should be consistent across instances. However, you may choose to include it in a previous step in your pipeline. It can be used to bring different images to have the same or similar voxel size.</p>

<h2 id="2-medical-image-rescaling-zoom--inout">2. Medical image rescaling (zoom- in/out)</h2>

<p>Rescaling can be regarded as an affine transformation. We will randomly zoom in and out of the image. <strong>This augmentation usually helps the model to learn scale-invariant features.</strong></p>

<p>It is important to see that the empty area is filled with black pixels (zero intensity).</p>

<p>The next one on the list is 3D rotation.</p>

<h2 id="3-3d-medical-image-rotation">3. 3D Medical image rotation</h2>

<p>Rotation is one of the most common methods to achieve data augmentation in computer vision. It has also been considered a self-supervised technique with remarkable results [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spyros Gidaris et al.</a> ].</p>

<p>In medical imaging, it is an equal import functionality that has also been used from self-supervised pretraining [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xinrui Zhuang et al. 2019 </a>]. A simple random 3D rotation in a given range of degrees can be illustrated with the code below:</p>

<em>Random 3D rotation</em></p>

<p>We simply have to define the axis and the rotation angle. As scaling provided the model with more diversity in order to learn scale-invariant features, rotation aids in learning rotation-invariant features.</p>

<p>Next in our list is image flipping.</p>

<h2 id="4-3d-medical-image-flip">4. 3D medical image flip</h2>

<p>Similar to common RGB images, we can perform axis flipping in medical images. At this point, it is really important to clarify one thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we perform augmentations and/or preprocessing in our data, we may have to apply similar operations on the ground truth data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, if we tackle the task of <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">medical image segmentation</a>, it is important to flip the target segmentation map. A simple implementation can be found below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>

<em>The initial image as a reference and two flipped versions</em></p>

<p>Observe that by flipping one axis, two views change. The first image on top is the initial image as a reference.</p>

<h2 id="5-medical-image-shifting-displacement">5. Medical image shifting (displacement)</h2>

<p>Here I would like to tell something else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rotation, shifting, and scaling are nothing more than affine transformations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I implement them by just defining the affine transformations and apply it in the image with scipy, and sometimes I use the already-implemented functions for multi-dimensional image processing.</p>

<p>In order to use this operation in my data augmentation pipeline, you can see that I have included a wrapper function. The latter basically samples a random number, usually in the desired range, and calls the affine transformation function. Below is the implementation for random shifting/displacement.</p>

However, that means any two companies that both have your personal email address can easily trade information about you.</p><p>Recently, it has become common for companies to sell our personal information. Even governments are starting to sell your personal information – both the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjekz/the-california-dmv-is-making-dollar50m-a-year-selling-drivers-personal-information">California DMV</a> and the <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/i-team-florida-dmv-sells-your-personal-information-to-private-companies-marketing-firms">Florida DMV</a> have been found selling citizens' private data to make money.</p><h4>Criminals</h4><p>For criminals, your inbox is a doorway to identity and financial theft.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.phishingbox.com/assets/files/images/Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report-DBIR-2019.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Report</a>, 94% of malware is sent over email and 31% of all data breaches included a phishing element. Attackers know that if a well-disguised email (often masquerading as a trusted source, or using leaked information associated with your personal email address) arrives in your inbox, there's a good chance you'll click the link, or open the file — which is often all they need to hook you as their next victim.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>Anonymous, service specific, and replaceable email addresses – incognito addresses.</p><p>Many email providers have spam blockers, but they don't catch all unwanted mail, and spam is only one barrier to a quieter, safer inbox. Incognito addresses fill in the security and privacy gap where existing email providers fall short.</p><h4>Anonymous</h4><p>Using an anonymous email address for each online service (e.g. bigstore.com, socialbook.com, videobox.com) gives you more control over which companies have access to your online identity. Email address anonymity makes it difficult for advertisers to share and sell your data without your consent, and it makes it difficult for criminals to deploy personalized or targeted attacks.</p><h4>Service Specific</h4><p>By creating a unique, anonymous email address for each online service, you make it impossible for advertisers or criminals to create identifying associations with your email alone.</p><p>In addition, using a unique email address for each service enables Owl Mail to alert you if any inbound emails are from an unexpected sender – preventing spam from reaching your inbox, and illuminating when companies may have had a data breach or sold your incognito email address.</p><h4>Replaceable</h4><p>If your personal email address is sold by a company, or leaked in a data breach, there isn't much you can do in response. Your family, friends, and co-workers reach you at that address, so it's difficult to abandon. All you can do is hope your email service is winning the war on your always-increasing spam.</p><p>In contrast, incognito addresses are easily destroyed and replaced. If you discover an incognito address has been leaked, just delete and replace it – stop spam before it begins!</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>Incognito address are a major step toward better privacy and security online. But, that's just the start. At Owl Mail, we plan to build the world's best email tools – creating a spam, phishing, and malware free experience with easy-to-use end-to-end encryption to all of your messages.</p><p>We hope you are as excited about quieter, safer email as we are.</p><p><span><a href="https://owlmail.io/sign-in">Try Incognito Addresses</a></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ATM skimming is a type of payment card fraud. It is a way of stealing PINs and other information off credit cards and debit cards by rigging machines with hidden recording devices.</p><p>Bank ATMs and payment terminals at gas pumps and other merchants are the targets of this scam. Thieves then use the stolen information to produce fake cards and spend victims’ money or take cash straight from their bank accounts.</p><p>“If they are able to retrieve the card number itself, it’s common to use those in online marketplaces or to sell the card numbers in batches to other criminal groups who may attempt to use them for fraudulent purchases,” says Nathan Wenzler, chief cybersecurity strategist at Tenable, a cybersecurity firm in Columbia, Maryland.</p><p>Here is what you need to know about ATM skimming and how to protect yourself.</p><h3>Methods of ATM skimming</h3><p>Thieves employ several techniques to steal data that’s embedded in the magnetic stripe on credit and debit cards:</p><div><ul><li>A plastic overlay placed over the ATM keypad captures PINs as they are entered.</li><li>An overlay placed over the card insertion slot records the data on the magnetic stripe.</li><li>Tiny cameras placed on an ATM record keypad entries and your fingers as you type.</li><li>An overlay that covers the whole ATM faceplate is embedded with cameras and card-slot and keypad overlays.</li></ul></div><p>“Skimmers are getting harder and harder to detect, especially with the advent of 3-D printers and other inexpensive fabrication devices,” warns Wenzler.</p><p>Even chip-enabled payment cards, which are more secure than magnetic stripe cards, are vulnerable to theft. By placing a super-thin shim between the chip and the chip reader inside the ATM, thieves can capture your PIN and other card information. These devices are called “shimmers,” and as chip technology becomes more prevalent, they are starting to supplant skimmers as thieves’ choice tool.</p><h3>How prevalent is ATM skimming?</h3><p>You hear quite a lot about ATM skimming these days, especially at gas pumps. It’s a scam that costs consumers and U.S. financial institutions more than $1 billion each year.</p><p>“ATMs and gas pumps are certainly the most common targets,” Wenzler says, “but customers should be aware and vigilant of any card reader anywhere, whether that’s restaurants, retail stores, coffee shops or wherever else you may swipe your card.”</p><p>Wenzler notes that advancements in 3-D printers that can replicate an ATM’s card reader are making skimming cheaper, easier and more accessible to less sophisticated criminals.</p><p>“Plus, they can sell or share these (skimming) blueprints with others, making it easier to scale up attacks wherever that particular model of ATM is used ... This makes it even harder for law enforcement to track and trace who is performing these kinds of attacks,” he says.</p><p>Also, wireless technology enables cyber-thieves to retrieve stolen PINs and other card data “without approaching the ATM ever again, making it very difficult to catch them in the act,” Wenzler says.</p><h3>Ways to avoid ATM skimming</h3><p>To avoid becoming a victim of ATM skimming and possibly having your bank account cleaned out, follow these tips:</p><div><ul><li>Go with cardless ATM transactions. Using your smartphone and your bank’s mobile app, you can conduct ATM transactions from anywhere, without a physical debit card.</li><li>Use debit and credit cards with chip technology, which is more secure.</li><li>Run your debit card as a credit card transaction and don’t enter your PIN.</li><li>Avoid using a debit card if you have linked accounts. Use a credit card instead.</li><li>Use a mobile payment system such as Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or PayPal.</li><li>Check your bank statements regularly for suspicious transactions; get account alerts and notifications.</li><li>Besides using safer payment methods, there are some physical, common-sense ways to avoid being an ATM skimming victim:</li><li>Don’t use ATMs located in dark, out-of-the-way places, in bars and restaurants or in areas with lots of tourists. Go to your bank or inside a store to use an ATM.</li><li>If the ATM doesn’t immediately return your card after the transaction, waste no time in reporting it to the card issuer.</li><li>Look over the ATM for signs of skimmers or ask the store manager to do it for you. Don’t use ATMs that have damaged or loose parts or look as if they have been tampered with.</li><li>“Try wiggling the card reader area to see if it feels loose or if there is a ‘cover’ over it,” advises Wenzler. “That could be a sign of a skimmer having been placed on top of the actual card reader itself.”</li><li>Use a gas pump that is within view of the gas station attendant or pay inside.</li><li>Cover the PIN pad when you enter your PIN.</li></ul></div><h3>Beware of e-skimming</h3><p>While some criminals skulk around banks and stores to attach skimmers to physical payment terminals, other criminals steal your credit and debit card data without getting out of their pajamas.</p><p>“Cyber-criminals now practice the concept of digital skimming or e-skimming,” says Ameet Naik, security evangelist and director of product marketing at PerimeterX, a California-based cybersecurity company. “Instead of placing a physical device on the ATM, they inject a piece of malicious code into a website script that skims credit card numbers from checkout pages on e-commerce sites.”</p><p>When there is an online payment transaction, the business collects personal data from the buyer, explains Naik. This usually includes name, email address, phone number, password, payment card data and verification code. “This data is most vulnerable at the point of entry,” Naik says.</p><p>The store, payment processor or bank is often not aware that skimming has occurred, Naik says, because the information was taken from the consumer’s device, not a company server.</p><p>“The lack of visibility means that the attacks often go undetected for weeks or months, while hackers yield a rich bounty of credit card numbers to sell on the dark web,” he says.</p><h3>Ways to avoid e-scamming:</h3><div><ul><li>Don’t enter your card number repeatedly on a website. “If your trusted merchant has an option to save the card number for future purchases, choose it so as to minimize the times you have to type in your information,” advises Naik.</li><li>Use alternative payment methods such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or PayPal so that you don’t have to type in payment card information. “However, consumers must ensure they use strong passwords to secure these services and avoid account compromise,” Naik says.</li><li>Be on the lookout for fake checkout pages that impersonate an online merchant. “Be especially wary of payment transactions that appear to fail,” warns Naik. “If that happens, immediately contact the card issuer who can place a fraud alert on your account.</li><li>Monitor your credit reports and bank and credit card statements routinely for suspicious activity, and report it right away.</li></ul></div><h3>Bottom line</h3><p>Whether you are using a physical bank ATM, a point-of-sale terminal at a merchant or doing cardless ATM transactions, there is always a risk of fraud. Chip-enabled credit and debit cards are safer than magnetic stripe cards, but even those can be hacked.</p><p>“Frankly, until we can move away from using magnetic stripes for transactions, the technology that creates skimmers will continue to advance and improve, resulting in more attacks against more devices against the globe,” Wenzler says.</p><p>To minimize your risk exposure, follow the tips and advice outlined here and stay vigilant.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Learn how to expose your local OpenFaaS functions to the Internet for development &amp; testing.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a> you can build functions, APIs, and microservices in a short period of time and host them on Kubernetes. You’ll also get built-in monitoring, metrics, auto-scaling, and a REST API for management.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-openfaas-ingress/openfaas-logo.png" alt="OpenFaaS Logo"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenFaaS has over 23k GitHub stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this post we’ll deploy the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> to your local Kubernetes cluster to enable your OpenFaaS gateway and functions to be exposed on the Internet. Why would you want to do this?</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-openfaas-ingress/openfaas-inlets-pro.png" alt="Conceptual architecture"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inlets-operator takes over the role of a cloud LoadBalancer, and provisions an exit-server on public cloud to tunnel traffic to the IngressController.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Hybrid Cloud:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For hosting services on-premises</li>
  <li>For hybrid cloud whether part of your offering is still on a private network</li>
  <li>Receive webhook events or data feeds from third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>For faster testing and development loops:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expose a webhook via a function</li>
  <li>Integrate with OAuth and SSO solutions</li>
  <li>Integrate with payment gateways</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve completed this tutorial, you will be able to share your functions and APIs hosted on OpenFaaS with colleagues, friends, and third-parties for integrations. You’ll also be able to deploy to your local OpenFaaS cluster from CI systems like GitHub Actions.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will need an inlets PRO license, <a href="https://inlets.dev/">start a 14-day free trial</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> on your local machine.</li>
  <li>arkade (CLI) installed below</li>
  <li>A domain and access to your DNS admin panel to create a sub-domain for OpenFaaS</li>
  <li>A cloud account on DigitalOcean or another cloud, to provision an exit-server with a public IP</li>
</ul>

<p>The main pre-requisite for the tutorial is the arkade CLI, which can be used to download CLI tools and to install helm charts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># You can also run without sudo, but you'll need to move the arkade binary</span>
<span># to /usr/local/bin yourself</span>
curl <span>-sLS</span> https://dl.get-arkade.dev | <span>sudo </span>sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>inlets ® is a network tunnel that can be used to connect services between private and public clusters. The open source version comes with support for HTTP and the commercial edition (inlets PRO) adds support for TCP and has built-in TLS. The <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> projects can set up exit-server VMs for you on public cloud, which are used to gain access to your private services.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know? You can also create your own exit servers with Terraform, or host them as Kubernetes Pods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the drawbacks of SaaS tunnels is that they often lack a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> integration for LoadBalancers or Ingress. Those which have limited support tend to force you to also use the rest of their product suite like their DNS and edge solution. In this tutorial you’ll be able ot use your own domain and pick which cloud you use for hosting your tunnel server for inlets.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-cluster">Create a cluster</h3>

<p>Download KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) and kubectl, the CLI for Kubernetes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade get kind <span>--version</span> v0.9.0
arkade get kubectl <span>--version</span> v1.19.2

<span>export </span><span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$PATH</span>:<span>$HOME</span>/.arkade/bin/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Create a Kubernetes cluster using KinD (Kubernetes in Docker):</p>



<h3 id="install-openfaas">Install OpenFaaS</h3>

<p>Get the OpenFaaS CLI:</p>



<p>You can install OpenFaaS with a single command:</p>



<p>Follow the post-installation instructions to log into OpenFaaS.</p>

<h3 id="install-the-inlets-operator">Install the inlets-operator</h3>

<p>Around half a dozen cloud providers are supported by the inlets-operator including AWS EC2, Equinix Metal, Hetzner, Civo, Linode and GCE. It’s open source and you can contribute on GitHub.</p>

<p>Save an access token for your cloud provider as <code>$HOME/access-token</code>, in this example I’m using DigitalOcean. You can create a token from your dashboard.</p>

<p>Make sure you set <code>LICENSE</code> with the value of your license.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>LICENSE</span><span>=</span><span>"INLETS_PRO_LICENSE_JWT"</span>
<span>export </span><span>ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/access-token

arkade <span>install </span>inlets-operator <span>\</span>
 <span>--provider</span> digitalocean <span>\</span>
 <span>--region</span> lon1 <span>\</span>
 <span>--token-file</span> <span>$ACCESS_TOKEN</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--license</span> <span>$LICENSE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can run <code>arkade install inlets-operator --help</code> to see a list of other cloud providers.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Set the <code>--region</code> flag as required, it’s best to have low latency between your current location and where the exit-servers will be provisioned.</li>
  <li>Use your license in <code>--license</code>, or omit this flag if you just want to serve port 80 from your IngressController without any TLS</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configure-your-dns-records">Configure your DNS records</h3>

<p>Now create a DNS A record in your admin panel example: <code>openfaas.example.com</code>, set the TTL to the lowest possible value of around 1 minute or 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Sometimes DNS records can take a few minutes to propagate throughout the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="install-an-ingresscontroller-and-cert-manager">Install an IngressController and cert-manager</h3>

<p>An IngressController allows you to serve a TLS certificate for the OpenFaaS gateway and functions, cert-manager allows you to obtain a TLS certificate for free from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>cert-manager
arkade <span>install </span>ingress-nginx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Find out the IP address of the LoadBalancer created for ingress-nginx, it will be listed under EXTERNAL-IP:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl get svc ingress-nginx-controller
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On DigitalOcean the IP address will appear in less than 30 seconds, which is much quicker than the typical cloud LoadBalancer that can take 5-10 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-ingress-record">Create an Ingress record</h3>

<p>arkade has a built-in way to generate Ingress records for OpenFaaS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>TOP_DOMAIN</span><span>=</span>example.com
<span>export </span><span>DOMAIN</span><span>=</span>openfaas.<span>$TOP_DOMAIN</span>

<span>export </span><span>EMAIL</span><span>=</span>webmaster@<span>$TOP_DOMAIN</span>
arkade <span>install </span>openfaas-ingress <span>\</span>
 <span>--domain</span> <span>$DOMAIN</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--email</span> <span>$EMAIL</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You now need to wait for your DNS entry to propagate and for cert-manager to obtain a certificate.</p>

<h3 id="log-into-openfaas">Log into OpenFaaS</h3>

<p>Log-in to OpenFaaS with TLS</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>OPENFAAS_URL</span><span>=</span>https://<span>$DOMAIN</span>

<span>PASSWORD</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>kubectl get secret <span>-n</span> openfaas basic-auth <span>-o</span> <span>jsonpath</span><span>=</span><span>"{.data.basic-auth-password}"</span> | <span>base64</span> <span>--decode</span><span>;</span> <span>echo</span><span>)</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$PASSWORD</span> | faas-cli login <span>-s</span>

faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo
faas-cli list <span>-v</span>

faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also open the OpenFaaS UI over an encrypted connection:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>echo </span>Open a browser at https://<span>$DOMAIN</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-openfaas-ingress/portal-ui.png" alt="OpenFaaS Portal"></p>

<h3 id="learn-more-about-openfaas">Learn more about OpenFaaS</h3>

<p>From here you can now share your URL for your various functions by running <code>faas-cli describe FUNCTION</code>, this will give you a synchronous and asynchronous URL that you can enter into a third-party’s webhook settings page.</p>

<p>You can also host websites and APIs with OpenFaaS, as long as your Dockerfile follows the <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/">OpenFaaS workloads convention</a> of having a health endpoint and listening to HTTP traffic on port 8080.</p>

<![CDATA[Better Git diff output for Ruby, Python, Elixir, Go]]>

October 19, 2020 | https://tekin.co.uk/2020/10/better-git-diff-output-for-ruby-python-elixir-and-more | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tekin.co.uk/2020/10/better-git-diff-output-for-ruby-python-elixir-and-more">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>The regular Git users amongst you will be familiar with the diff output that breaks down into “hunks” like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> class TicketPdf
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line (starting <code>@@</code>) is known as the hunk header, and is there to help orientate the change. It gives us the line numbers for the change (the numbers between the <code>@@..@@</code>), but also a textual description for the enclosing context where the change happened, in this example <code>"class TicketPdf"</code>. Git tries to figure out this enclosing context, whether it’s a function, module or class definition. For C-like languages it’s pretty good at this. But for the Ruby example above it’s failed to show us the immediate context, which is actually a method called <code>tickets_as_html</code>. That’s because out of the box Git isn’t able to recognise the Ruby syntax for a method definition, which would be <code>def ticket_as_html</code>.</p>

<p>What we really want to see is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> def tickets_as_html
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s not just Ruby where Git struggles to figure out the correct enclosing context. Many other programming languages and file formats also get short-changed when it comes to the hunk header context.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it’s not only possible to configure a custom regex specific to your language to help Git better orient itself, there’s even a pre-defined set of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/userdiff.c">patterns for many languages and formats right there in Git</a>. All we have to do is tell Git which patterns to use for our file extensions.</p>

<p>We can do this by defining a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes"><code>.gitattributes</code></a> file inside our repo that maps the Ruby file extensions to the diff pattern for Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span>.rb <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
<span>*</span>.rake <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some open source projects define their own <code>.gitattributes</code> file. There’s <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in Rails</a>. There’s even <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in the Git source</a> that enables the diff patterns for Perl and Python.</p>

<h2 id="configure-a-global-gitattributes-file">Configure a global .gitattributes file</h2>

<p>Instead of adding a <code>.gitattributes</code> file to every repo we can configure a global <code>.gitattributes</code> file. Just create a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in your home directory, fill it with all the file formats you are interested in and point Git at it:</p>

<pre><code>  <strong>$ git config --global core.attributesfile ~/.gitattributes</strong>
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve put together an <a href="https://gist.github.com/tekin/12500956bd56784728e490d8cef9cb81">example .gitattributes file</a> with some common file formats to get you started.</p>

<p>I have no idea why Git doesn’t have these file format patterns configured by default. Thanks to Tom whose <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart/status/1304401459069452290">exasperated tweet</a> brought this non-obvious feature to my attention.</p>

		<p><em>I first posted this on <a href="https://davidnoelromas.com/2020/09/02/data-practices-for-scrappy-startups.html">my personal blog</a> and was inspired to write more about the topic, hence this website! I’m still very eager for feedback; please consider filling out this very short <a href="https://forms.gle/6PtpnLDtxuctU9Py7">Google Form</a> after reading. Thanks!</em></p>

<hr>

<p><br>
Even though the <a href="https://stripe.com/">scrappy startup I’m most enamored with right now</a> is (ahem) bigger than this, the 1-, 2- and 3-person startups of the world hold a special place in my heart. There’s something intoxicating about small groups of people creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>By the time startups reach the point where the “scale-up” happens, they usually have some aspect of a “data practice” in place. There will be an engineering side (either dedicated data engineers or application/infrastructure engineers who are “borrowed” periodically to build and maintain the data systems) and an analyst side (again, either dedicated data scientists or some set of people who are comfortable using SQL to answer business questions). Tiny startups typically don’t have this, primarily for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the very early days of a startup, the amount of user/customer activity is small and therefore the amounts of data generated are perceived as having low value.</li>
  <li>The resources required to implement a data practice are therefore perceived as being better spent elsewhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, “perceived as.”</p>

<p>First, small amounts of user/customer activity can still result in highly valuable data. How are people finding your new feature? Do free users engage with it as much as paid users? What can you learn from looking at cohort behavior before/after a pricing change?</p>

<p>Even if it’s true that early data is valuable data, it might still be too expensive to implement a “data practice,” right? What would it even entail? The Facebooks and Googles of the world have armies of engineers that speak another language, with words like Hive, Presto, Hadoop, and Flink, but all of that is usually a distraction for founders and early employees who must remain focused on making things people want. You could just spin up a separate database (whatever your application uses) and start dumping reporting data in there, but to do that well you’d probably want to build a frontend for it so you could include data from third parties like your CRM, your marketing email service, website analytics, etc. And you probably also want some sort of visualization tool, the stuff that enterprises call “business intelligence.” And if you do your job well and collect a lot of relevant data, you’ll quickly reach storage sizes that become a material part of your infrastructure costs.</p>

<p>So, while I still contend that there <em>is</em> a way to do all of this cost-effectively (in terms of both money <em>and</em> time!), it’s easy to understand why most early-stage startups don’t bother. This results in one of the few advantages big companies hold over small startups: big companies which are well-run are disciplined about using data to drive decisions. <strong>Small startups might pay lip service to data-driven decisions, but they can’t actually do this because they don’t even have all their data in one place.</strong></p>

<p>The way I learned about all this, by the way, was from working in my own tiny startup a few years ago. The solution I came up with at the time was not only for internal reporting; we also used it to serve embedded analytics to our users (at a small fraction of the cost charged by third parties who specialize in this stuff). A lot of the underlying technologies have improved since then, which is great news for anyone interested in re-implementing this today.</p>

<p>The very rough recipe is as-follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon Athena</a> to store your data. This uses Presto and a bunch of other fancy data-land goodies under the hood, but you don’t need to worry about that. Unfortunately the documentation for Athena is inscrutable to mere mortals, but there are a <strong>simple set of best-practices you can follow without becoming an Athena expert (let me know in the <a href="https://forms.gle/6PtpnLDtxuctU9Py7">Google Form</a> if you’d like me to write about this).</strong></li>
  <li>Build a simple ingestion pipeline. This is way easier nowadays, because Athena supports SQL INSERT statements, so you can just build a normal REST API with a normal SQL backend. (It used to be necessary to interact with the S3 files that back Athena, and this was awkward.) I recommend having a single endpoint to consume all your writes, rather than separate endpoints for each resource type, because you want the process of adding new resource types to be very lightweight. You can put this API behind a queue if you envision consuming a lot of writes.</li>
  <li>Don’t worry about migrating all your existing data into the system, at least not at first. (It will feel intimidating and prevent you from actually using it.) Instead, focus on instrumenting your app to copy new writes into Athena (in addition to your application database). You might also want to instrument new events, which are unrelated to your application objects—page loads, for example. You probably don’t need to worry about instrumenting client-side events, at least initially.</li>
  <li>Instrument all your third-party tools to send data into Athena as well. The easiest way to do this is using something like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. This way your entire company can be queried in one place.</li>
  <li>Now you need a convenient way to query Athena and visualize the results. The options at this point are endless (it’s “just SQL” after all) and switching costs are low, so pick anything you like. <a href="https://redash.io/">Redash</a> is a nice open-source option which you could either host yourself or have them host.</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach costs approximately 1 engineer-week to set up, with an ongoing monthly cost in the low hundreds of dollars (depending on storage size and usage). The general architecture will scale from gigabytes all the way up to petabytes of data if you need it to. Best of all, once it’s in place, this system will change the question from “How can I measure this?” to “What should I measure?” which is a much more powerful question.</p>

			<p><em>How do you find out if someone is a vegan/minimalist/cross fitter? Don't worry: they will tell you within 10 minutes.</em> </p><p>Remote workers think that they have found the cure to all diseases. And they (we) are quick to let you know about how remote work will solve all your problems.</p><ul><li>Too many meetings? <em>It should have been a document; remote work would have made you do that more often.</em></li><li>Tired all the time? <em>Probably because of your commute. Remote work would have solved that.</em></li><li>Seasonal depression? <em>Well, I take a sunlit walk every single day, because I can work from home, so the time change doesn't affect me: I don't spend all the daylight hours in a cubicle.</em></li><li>Don't have enough time for family? <em>Ah, you need to try remote work. You will be around more and it will make you a better parent.</em></li><li>Acne? Eating out too much? Not tall enough? <em>Obviously, remote work will provide time for skincare, home cooking, and to apply the latest advances in genetic engineering.</em></li></ul><p>This attitude tracks as arrogance and separates us from what we want: <strong>for more people to work remotely; for it to become more normal.</strong></p><p>There are two audiences that hear all this remote-work bragging: the skeptic and the curious.</p><p>For the curious, they want to know when and how it works, and what benefits are real. Can you really have more time for your family without your work suffering? Can you really build a career this way? The last thing they want to hear is that the remote community is condescending, elitist, or somehow tied to a specific situation. Being honest about what it makes harder and easier helps more for those that are interested. You don't have to be a digital nomad or travel the world to work from where you wish, you don't have to be a freelancer or own your own small business to do it. You don't have to be an expert in your field to do it.</p><p>For the skeptical audience, many of the arrogant messages are simply ammunition to help them dismiss the practice as unprofessional. Let's say you post about how you can hang out by the pool and work for a few hours, but don't talk about how you only do this a few days a month or about how you do it to get sunshine because you are struggling with working too much and not going outdoors. Someone from a more traditional work environment couldn't take a video call from beside a pool without getting fired, so its hard for them to imagine a workplace that would allow it. Instead, talk about how your workplace transitioned and/or runs a results-oriented environment, and what happens if you were just tanning all day and not actually working. To implement remote work a company needs <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/companies-that-support-remote-workers-win-against-those-that-dont/">a way to track how much is getting done</a> that does not rely on the traditional methods. Be honest with both sides.</p><p>I personally think that remote work can be effective in a very large majority of industries and experiences. I start my book about <a href="http://theartofworkingfromhome.com/">how to work from home effectively</a> by saying that <em><strong>anyone that does all their work on a computer owes it themselves to try it</strong></em>, because of how powerful it can be. &nbsp;Yet I understand why starting out your career you might prefer a drive to a large busy office so you can establish a lot of social relationships, or why as a manager you might want your people to be physically present so you can install a certain work culture quickly. </p><p>Don't we all just want remote work to be an option, at least part-time, for a larger number of people? If so let's be empathetic to the fact that to make remote work happen more companies and more workers need to know what they are doing, and we need to help them learn how. </p><p>To make sure I'm not (just) a blowhard, here is what I'm trying to do.</p><ul><li>Discuss the real <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/beginners-guide-working-from-home/">challenges</a> and <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/work-life-harmony-resistance/">obstacles</a> honestly and openly.</li><li>Explain why it is so important to us personally; explain where the <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/work-from-home-an-anniversary/">passion</a> for remote work comes from.</li><li>Provide <a href="http://theartofworkingfromhome.com/">resources that <em>help</em></a>, <a href="http://remoteworkguides.com/">for all parties</a>,<em> </em>rather than dismiss those who are trying to work remotely but currently can't.</li><li>Be cheerleaders for those that are new to it, rather than competitive or arrogant.</li></ul>

October 19, 2020 | https://hodovi.ch/blog/optimizing-postgres-full-text-search-django/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hodovi.ch/blog/optimizing-postgres-full-text-search-django/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Postgres provides great search capability out of the box. For the majority of Django apps there is no need to run and maintain an ElasticSearch cluster unless you need the advanced features ElasticSearch offers. Django integrates nicely with the Postgres search through the built in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/postgres/">Postgres module</a>.</p>
<p>For small data sets the default configuration performs well, however when your data grows in size the default search configuration becomes painfully slow and we need to enable certain optimizations to keep our queries fast.</p>
<p>This page will walk you through setting up Django and Postgres, indexing sample data and performing and optimizing full text search.</p>
<p>The examples go through a Django + Postgres setup, however the advice is generally applicable to any programming language or framework as long as it uses Postgres.</p>
<p><strong>If you're already a Django veteran you can skip the first steps and jump right into the optimization.</strong></p>

<li><a href="#measuring">Measuring the performance improvement</a></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-setup"><a id="project-setup"></a>Project setup</h2>
<p>Create the directories and setup the Django project.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mkdir django_postgres
<span>cd</span> django_postgres
python -m venv venv
<span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject full_text_search
<span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py startapp web
</pre></div>


<p>Now we'll need to install 3 dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>psycopg2: the Postgres client library for Python</li>
<li>wikipedia: a client library to retrieve Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>django-extensions: to simplify debugging of SQL queries</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span>pip install psycopg2 wikipedia django-extensions
</pre></div>


<p>We also need to run Postgres locally. I'll use a dockerized version of Postgres here since it's easier to set up, but feel free to install a Postgres binary if you'd like.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/docker-compose.yml</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>---</span>
<span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>'2.4'</span>
<span>services</span><span>:</span>
  <span>postgres</span><span>:</span>
    <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>postgres:11-alpine</span>
    <span>ports</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>'5432:5432'</span>
    <span>environment</span><span>:</span>
      <span># Set the Postgres environment variables for bootstrapping the default</span>
      <span># database and user.</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>:</span> <span>"me"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The project structure should now look like the output below. We'll ignore the venv directory as that is packed with files and irrelevant for now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ tree -I venv
.

        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py

<span>5</span> directories, <span>15</span> files
</pre></div>


<p>We will modify the default database settings to use Postgres instead of SQLite.  In settings.py change the <code>DATABASES</code> attribute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"ENGINE"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django.db.backends.postgresql"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"NAME"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We will also modify our <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> to include a few apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>django.contrib.postgres</code> the Postgres module for Django which is required for full text search</li>
<li><code>django_extensions</code> to print SQL logs when executing queries in Python</li>
<li>our <code>web</code> app</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/settings.py</code> and modify:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.admin'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.auth'</span><span>,</span>

    <span>'django_extensions'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'web'</span><span>,</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Start Postgres and Django.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
docker-compose up -d
./manage.py runserver
</pre></div>


<p>If we open our browser and enter http://localhost:8000 we should see a successful installation.</p>
<p>[image "django_installation_complete.png" not found]</p>
<h2 id="creating-models-and-indexing-sample-data"><a id="creating-models"></a>Creating models and indexing sample data</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a model which represents a Wikipedia page. For simplicity we'll use two fields: title and content.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/web/models.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>

    <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now run the migrations to create the model.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py makemigrations <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./manage.py migrate

<p>We'll use a script to index random wikipedia articles and save the contents to Postgres.</p>
<p>Edit <code>web/index_wikipedia.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>
<span>import</span> <span>wikipedia</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Now let's run our script to index Wikipedia. There will be errors when running the script, but don't worry about those as long as we manage to store a few hundred articles. The script will take a while to run so grab a cup of coffee and return in a few minutes.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>./</span><span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell_plus</span>

<p>Django performs two preparatory queries and finally executes our search query.  Looking at the last query we can at first glance see that the execution was ~315ms for the query execution and serialization alone. That's it far too slow when we want to keep our page load speeds in the double digits in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at why this query is performing so slowly.  Open a second terminal where we'll use the excellent <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reading-an-explain-analyze-query-plan">Postgres query analyzer</a>.  Copy the query from above and run <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>:</p>

<p>We can see that although the planning time is quite fast (~3ms) the execution time is very slow at ~220ms.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>We can note that the query performs a sequential scan over the entire table in order to find matching records. We can likely optimize the query by using an index.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Filter</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally the query normalizes the <code>content</code> column from text to a tsvector using <code>to_tsvector</code> in order to perform the full text search.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHERE</span> <span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>"web_page"</span><span>.</span><span>"content"</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>(</span><span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>tsvector</code> type is a tokenized version of our text which normalizes the search column (more on tokenization <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/indexing-for-full-text-search-in-postgresql/#tokenization">here</a>). Postgres needs to perform this normalization for every row and each row contains an entire Wikipedia page. This is both a CPU intensive and slow operation.</p>
<h3 id="specialized-search-column-and-gin-indexes"><a id="specialized-column"></a>Specialized search column and gin indexes</h3>
<p>In order avoid on-the-fly casting of text to tsvectors we'll create a specialized column which is used only for search. The column should be populated on inserts or updates. When querying is performed we'll avoid the performance penalty of casting types.</p>
<p>Since we can now have a tsvector type we are also able to add a gin index to speed up the query. The gin index ensures that the search will be performed with a indexed scan instead of a sequential scan over all records.</p>
<p>Open our <code>web/models.py</code> file and make modifications to the Page model.</p>

<p>This photo was me a year ago to the day, selling the company I founded five years before.</p>

<p>I thought I’d write some notes about the process and the story.</p>



<p>Until today, there has never been anything more challenging in my life that I have done than running BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>I moved to Switzerland 7 years ago and opened BinaryEdge a little over a year after getting here.</p>

<p>I still remember sitting down with my friend Pekka Jackli and telling him: “I want to open a company that does internet scanning, but I don’t know how to do it. Can you help me ?” (He jumped immediately at the challenge and ended up being a co-founder.)</p>

<p>I had previously founded a security research group (called PTCoreSec) that played around with the idea of internet scanning, so I thought it was time to pick that up again.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/ptcoresec.png" alt="ptcoresec"></p>

<p>To make sure everyone understands the situation I was in, I decided to open BinaryEdge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a country I had just arrived at (1 year is not enough to adapt)</li>
  <li>In a country where I do not speak any of the native languages.</li>
  <li>Never having gone to business school or read a single business book</li>
  <li>Not having any close friends or people I could go to in the country that could provide advice on running a startup</li>
  <li>Having my family to take care of as we moved here for a job</li>
</ul>

<p>Some might wonder why on earth, I would take on this challenge under these conditions instead of trying to make them more optimal first. But here I was just a few years after beating cancer and being stuck in a bed for one year. It had left me with this weird feeling that I had just wasted that one year of my life doing “nothing”, so even if the situation wasn’t perfect, my energy was at an all-time high, if cancer couldn’t stop me, well nothing could.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="fuck cancer"></p>

<p><strong>PS: Fuck Cancer!</strong></p>

<p>After I spoke with Pekka, we immediately got started figuring out how we would register the company and how we would get some funding.</p>

<p>Pekka introduced me to Till Spillmann, a lawyer-entrepreneur that I had to convince to invest in something that didn’t even exist back then other than in the format of a prototype and PowerPoint!</p>

<p>Sitting down with Till, I showed him evidence that we were doing something different and the problems we wanted to solve (these have changed over the years, and we have slowly refined some of our approaches); I convinced Till to be the first official investor.</p>

<p>This was a great win for team BinaryEdge. Till brought what is typically called smart-money. He brought the needed capital that allowed us to get a small group of developers to start putting together the platform’s first version and all his knowledge and resources as a lawyer.</p>

<p>We started building a better internet scanning platform, improving the types of data we collect and onboard new enterprise customers. (I will go into more in-depth details of the ups and downs of this in a future post!)</p>

<p>At some point, I remember sitting down with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/halvarflake">Thomas Dullien</a>, and asking him for some advice, which ended up with him being the next and last investor ever into BinaryEdge. To this day, bringing Thomas onboard is one of my proudest achievements as there has been no one that has given me as good help or advice as he has. He had already gone through the experience of opening a startup and selling it, so he was the one person that just “got me” and all the headaches and complications I was going through. If you can get Thomas as a friend, investor, or advisor, do it. He is a wonderful human being!</p>

<p>During most of the time of BinaryEdge, I always had a second full-time job. The money BinaryEdge generated was to grow BinaryEdge. I took a salary at the beginning to keep things on track and going but then ended up feeling like the money could be better used to grow the team faster and that I could just deal with having two jobs.</p>



<p>From the moment I met Joshua Motta, I knew joining Coalition to go work with him in some capacity was in my future. When he initially floated the idea by me of Coalition acquiring BinaryEdge (Coalition had already been a customer for a while), we were in a situation where we had the option to raise a funding round or get acquired (by Coalition or 2 other parties that had shown interest), and I had to make a decision.</p>

<p>Our objective was to go down the cyber-insurance path and build a platform to sell cyber-insurance if we had fundraised. This was known to most people as we had already started blogging about it. Cyber insurance is a type of business I was a big believer in from the first day I heard about it, not how the market predominantly currently works but rather the revolutionary way we do it at Coalition and that we wanted to do ourselves.</p>

<p>We had a few other acquisition opportunities on the table from current customers; however, I did not believe we would have been a good fit. I felt strongly I needed to believe in the company that was acquiring us and their business model.</p>

<p>After about two months of the initial conversation, Joshua flew to Zürich and sat down with me Pekka and Till, while Thomas joined remotely. He explained who Coalition was, why they wanted to acquire us, and <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com/blog/why-we-acquired-binaryedge">the secret master plan</a>.</p>

<p>The fit was perfect, the desire was there by both parties, and with that, we triggered the next phase, which brought the hard part of the process—due diligence. Looking at how much ahead of the market Coalition was business wise made it an easy decision on what I wanted for BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>For about two months, a team of people and lawyers from Coalition passed a comb over every document I signed, every decision I made and asked a LOT of questions. To say that this is a stressful situation is to put it lightly.</p>

<p>Having an M &amp; A Lawyer in the team helped a lot as he knew this process like the back of his hand, which enabled us to get through the diligence at a fantastic pace (compared to some of the stories I have read before).</p>

<p>As it is now public, we ended up being acquired, and we joined the Coalition team; and a few days after the first photo at the beginning of this post, we got on a flight to the USA for the first offsite.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-us.png" alt="offsite"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-coalition.jpg" alt="offsite2"></p>

<p><strong>So what do we do these days?</strong></p>

<p>I became the General Manager for Customer Security at Coalition. I run the BinaryEdge Enterprise business and build tools to protect our policyholders and bridge the collection done by our team with the underwriting, data, and security team at Coalition.</p>

<p>Florentino flourished into a fantastic engineering manager and runs the engineering team associated with the scanning engine (the team has grown quite a bit since). It has been a privilege to see him evolve over the years.</p>

<p>Tom works with me on growing our enterprise business  (If I were to say Florentino is my right hand, Tom would be my left) while also doing a lot with me on the product management and planning.</p>

<p>Ana continues her career as a data scientist (she is one of the people in my life I admire the most, thinking about how before BinaryEdge she had never written a single line of code to being the amazing data scientist she is today just makes me proud).</p>

<p>Marco was a dad and moved to the data science team as a data engineer to help with faster integration of our data. He was the best CTO one could have asked for and just want BinaryEdge needed.</p>

<p>This team is what made all of this possible, and I will forever be thankful to them for everything they did. They made my dream theirs, and I will forever be indebted to them for that. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and this group was the reflection of that. There was no quitting on us.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Opening a startup forces you to learn specific skills, fast, that otherwise you probably wouldn’t care about. Invoicing, accounting, planning, dealing with banks, customers, partnerships, etc…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you go through it, a lot of things become more comfortable in life. To get to the point of where you’re feeling pressure or panic takes a lot more than it did before because while you’re running your startup, it will happen that you will go through those feelings, and you will have to figure out how to solve them or get out of those situations (often on your own!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going from being someone’s employer to employing people is a HUGE shift in your life. Having people you’re responsible for and salaries to pay or having investors who gave you money and that you need to show hope that they will get a return is a level of responsibility that I am not sure anything else in life can prepare you for. (Speaking on a phone with a customer that is &gt;10 days late with a payment while having to be polite is one of the hardest things you might ever do).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on something you founded makes it that the highs are just acceptable but the lows are really deep. Use the wins as small as they are to come out from low moments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running a remote team is hard. Back then there weren’t really any founder resources on how to do it properly and we had to figure out a lot on our own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entrepreneur life is not as glamorous as a lot of the blogs, youtubers and others make it seem. It is hard, the grind to close customers and get paid is long (sometimes months long if you’re into enterprise software business) and you need to convince a bunch of strangers to join you on this crusade that is your vision as part of your team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve had a few people ask me what “comes next”, if I’m looking for investment for my next startup or just the general “Are you ever opening a startup again?”.</p>

<p>My focus is on growing and executing a vision that I get to have the honor of building and planning for, so what is next is Coalition.</p>

<p>I love my job, if you’ve interviewed with me lately you will have heard me say “I have the best job in the world” and the reason for that is that I still get to build <a href="https://asm.binaryedge.io/">amazing products</a> while working with a team that has more than doubled in size and that makes it an absolute pleasure to wake up each morning and get to work.</p>

<p>My team is everthing for me, all the cool stuff I get to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="js-post-content">
        <p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnie/status/1030488024906313728?s=12">this tweet</a> forever ago and thought “hey, that’d be kinda fun to write that...”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking about making an anti list of Dieter Rams’ 10 Principles for Good Design, with things like “Let the a/b tests decide it” and “Roll it back if the KPIs suffer”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote this post up as satire, but never published it because I realized it could be misconstrued as cynical and I didn’t want to be cynical and critical. Being critical is easy. “Can you build up rather than tear down?” So I never published. </p>
<p>Fast-forward a couple years, I ran across this cobwebbed post in my drafts and rediscovered the element of humor I found in it—humor borne out of a real confrontation with the realities of the world. Not a reality based in the evil intentions of humans, but rather the messiness of our nature. Doing hard things is hard, and along the way we quite often fail as humans. The fact is, sometimes we just don’t live up to our expectations, however lofty. And sometimes, if you can’t laugh at your reality, however failing, then all you’re left with is cynicism.</p>
<p>So with that preface, I present: Ten Anti-Principles of Good Design, riffing from Dieter Ram’s <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">Ten principles of good design</a>. I would hope that you, dear reader, find an element of relatable humor in them and not a critical cynicism. Good Design™ strives against the entropy of the universe, so it will forever be an uphill battle requiring exertion and energy to achieve It.</p>
<h2 id="1-good-design-is-innovative-fashionable">1. Good design is <del>innovative</del> fashionable</h2>
<p>Technological advancement is always revealing opportunities for new design. As technology progresses and innovates, the best way to design for it is to use whatever is in vogue, that way people take notice.</p>
<h2 id="2-good-design-makes-a-product-useful-sexy">2. Good design makes a product <del>useful</del> sexy</h2>
<p>A product is meant to be looked at. Good design slaps fresh paint on it, instilling desire into those who see it. </p>
<p>Also, sex.</p>
<h2 id="3-good-design-is-aesthetic">3. Good design is aesthetic</h2>
<p>And aesthetics are determined by data, not taste. </p>
<h2 id="4-good-design-makes-a-product-understandable-through-explanation">4. Good design makes a product understandable <em>through explanation</em></h2>
<p>A product should be self-explanatory, and by self-explanatory I mean it should explain itself. Slap some words in there because words are cheap. Just litter the thing with tooltips. Do everything but understand and take apart the complexity of your business that filters into your software.</p>
<h2 id="5-good-design-is-unobtrusive">5. Good design is <del>un</del>obtrusive</h2>
<p>A product should be used <em>exactly</em> the way you designed it to be used. Heavy-handed tactics are employed to make any other use of it impermissible.</p>
<h2 id="6-good-design-is-dishonest">6. Good design is (dis)honest</h2>
<p>As in, we use dark-patterns to influence people to do things in a way that will improve our bottom line.</p>
<h2 id="7-good-design-is-long-lasting">7. Good design is long-lasting</h2>
<p>But not too long-lasting. People need to keep consuming or we’ll go out of business.</p>
<h2 id="8-good-design-is-thorough-down-to-the-last-detail">8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h2>
<p>But also we have to ship shit, so you can disregard this principle as needed.</p>
<h2 id="9-good-design-is-environmentally-friendly">9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</h2>
<p>But only really when “environmentally-friendly” is cost-effective, meaning marketable and sellable.</p>
<h2 id="10-good-design-is-as-little-design-as-possible">10. Good design is as little design as possible</h2>
<p>...but we hired all these designers, and we gotta get our money’s worth. So slap some more “design” on there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

<h2 id="907">9:07</h2>

<p>A lot of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> protocols. In those days, we actually had a decent number …</p></div></div>

It promotes articles which use stunning visualizations to give the reader a more intuitive understanding of the topics. Spatial reasoning and imagination tends to work very well to understand topics in machine learning &amp; data science. This is not surprising, considering so much of the fundamental math behind the fields is linear algebra and calculus.

Besides being one of the most known deep learning researchers on earth, he is a font of creativity, creating widely used tools like <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver">arxiv sanity preserver</a> as side projects.</p><p>Countless people have entered the field via his <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Stanford cs231n course</a>, and you would benefit from committing his <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">neural network training recipe</a> to heart.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8">his talk about the real-life problems Tesla needs to overcome</a> when trying to apply machine learning at massive scale in the real world. It's impressive, informative and sobering.</p><p>Besides writing about ML directly, he also writes some <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html">good life advice</a> for <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">aspiring researchers</a>.</p><h2 id="uber-engineering"><a href="https://eng.uber.com/">Uber Engineering</a></h2><p>Uber's engineering blog is truly impressive in scope and breadth, covering a ton of topics, <a href="https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/">AI in particular</a>.</p><p>What I particularly like about Uber's engineering culture, is their tendency to spin off <a href="https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/open-source-articles/">super interesting and valuable open source projects</a> at a head-spinning pace. Some examples are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/ludwig">https://github.com/uber/ludwig</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/h3">https://github.com/uber/h3</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/react-vis">https://github.com/uber/react-vis</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/aresdb">https://github.com/uber/aresdb</a></li><li>And the list goes on and on and on... Hats off, Uber 🎩</li></ul><h2 id="openai-blog"><a href="https://openai.com/blog/">OpenAI Blog</a></h2><p>Putting aside any controversy, the OpenAI blog is undeniably beautiful. From time to time, it posts content about deep learning insights which only OpenAI's massive scale can reach, such as the hypothesized <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/">Deep Double Descent</a> phenomenon. They tend to post infrequent, high-impact pieces, so it's a high noise-to-signal ratio.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png" alt="Deep Double Descent, from OpenAI" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/</figcaption></figure><h2 id="taboola-blog"><a href="https://engineering.taboola.com/category/data-science/">Taboola Blog</a></h2><p>Not as well known as some of the other suggestions in this post, I find the Taboola blog to be unique - it deals with very down-to-earth, real-life problems when trying to use ML in production for "normal" businesses - less self driving cars and RL agents beating world champions, more "how do I know if my model is now predicting things with fake confidence?"</p><p>These problems are relevant for almost everyone working in the field, and they get less press coverage than the more sexy AI topics, but solving them correctly still requires world class talent. Thankfully, Taboola has both that talent AND the willingness and ability to write about it, so that others can learn as well.</p><h2 id="reddit">Reddit</h2><p>Alongside Twitter, there's nothing quite like Reddit to get caught up on papers, tools, and the wisdom of the crowds.</p><ul><li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/machinelearning/">reddit.com/r/machinelearning/</a></li><li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/machinelearning/">reddit.com/r/datascience/</a></li></ul><h2 id="state-of-ai"><a href="https://www.stateof.ai/">State of AI</a></h2><p>Published only annually, but contains very dense information content.</p><p>Relative to the other sources in this list, it's more accessible to (non-technical) business people.</p><p>What I like about the report, is it tries to give a more holistic view of where the industry and research is going at 10,000 feet - tying together advances in hardware, research, business, and even geopolitics.</p><p>Be sure to start by skipping to the end to read about the conflicts of interests :)</p><h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2><p>To be frank, in my opinion podcasts are problematic for learning about technical topics. Most of them have a hard time explaining the things that need explaining using audio only, as data science is a very visual field. Podcasts tend to succeed only in giving you leads for deeper investigation later, or in fun philosophical discussions.</p><p>Nevertheless, here are some recommendations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/"><strong>Lex Fridman's podcast</strong></a>, when he has on prominent researchers from the field of AI.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>The core of a product manager's job is to make change happen by influencing stakeholders without exerting power over them. It is not an easy task. But it is much more approachable with the right tools. </span></p> <p><span>Here I have curated some powerful principles and practical tips from the field of psychology as well as experts trained in persuasion so that you can rally support behind your ideas. </span></p> <p><span>Persuasion is the focus of this post. Other topics such as building the right product and making robust decisions are out of scope (to be covered in future posts). </span></p> <p><span>It should go without saying, but use these techniques wisely. Always do what's right for the product and for your customers.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Facts Are Overrated</span></h3></p> <p><span>We like to think we are perfectly logical and rational beings. But we are not. Humans tend to make decisions based on (often hidden) biases and emotions. </span></p> <p><span>By all means, bring facts and data to the table wherever possible. But don't expect facts alone to change people's minds. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reciprocation</span></h3></p> <p><span>We are hardwired to reciprocate favours. If you want a partner's cooperation tomorrow, do that person a favour today. But offer real value, not just as a means to get what you want.</span></p> <p><span>Another way in which reciprocation can work to your advantage is starting with a bigger (exaggerated) ask that is likely to get rejected. Then concede to a smaller request. It is more likely to work than when presented on its own.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Persuasion Still Works Even if the Person Recognizes the Technique</span></h3></p> <p><span>In a way, this is similar to optical or audio illusions. Even if you know certain psychological effects are at play, it is hard to resist. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>What you Think More About Becomes More Important</span></h3></p> <p><span>When you devote mental energy to an idea, you remember it better. In your mind, it becomes more important. For this reason, intentional "errors" in your message (such as a typo in your email) can make the message rise in importance, even as the errors attract criticism (which is a form of attention). </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Repetition is Persuasion</span></h3></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Commitment and Consistency</span></h3></p> <p><span>The moment we make a decision, there is a tendency to justify the wisdom of our choice and find reasons to dismiss the other options. From this point, cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias are at play. </span></p> <p><span>Trivial requests increase the likelihood of compliance to larger requests. In the book Influence, Robert Cialdini noted that once a small commitment has been made, people tend to add justification to further commitments. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Visual Persuasion</span></h3></p> <p><span>All else being equal, visual persuasion is more powerful than non-visual persuasion. Humans are generally visual creatures. Using visual language and visual imagery is persuasive. What's more, if you can make someone imagine the scene, you don't even need a physical picture.</span></p> <p><span>Try using the whiteboard in a meeting and drawing out ideas as you go, or attaching simple illustrations in your emails/messages to convey your ideas.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Thinking Past the Sale</span></h3></p> <p><span>Related to the above points about visualization and the importance we tend to assign to what we think about more, getting your stakeholder to "imagine" a future where your proposal will have manifested is powerful. </span></p> <p><span>As they think about your proposed future more, they are more likely to see opportunities to make that future a reality. In persuasion writer Scott Adams' observations, people tend to gravitate to the future they are imagining most vividly, even if they don’t want that future.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Social Proof</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you already have buy-in from some other stakeholders, you are more likely to gain support for your idea. </span></p> <p><span>You know that restaurant in town that is popular </span> <em>because</em> <span> it is popular? Or the TV show that everyone is talking about </span> <em>because</em> <span> everyone is talking about it? Your feature idea can be like that too.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Don't Feel Their Pain. Label It.</span></h3></p> <p><span>We all like to be heard. When we talk to people who ignore us, resentment and frustration build up. We talk past each other. Conversations break down.</span></p> <p><span>Pay close attention to the subtle changes in people when they respond to your words. One way to validate and acknowledge the other person's feelings is by labeling. Give their emotion a name. Then lead with words such as "it seems like...", "it sounds like...", or "it looks like...". </span></p> <p><span>And once you have used a label, be quiet and listen. Give the person a chance to share and reveal.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>"That's Right"</span></h3></p> <p><span>According to FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are "that’s right." If you are arguing with your stakeholder, you want to lead the conversation to a "that's right". </span></p> <p><span>It is at the point that they feel heard and become ready to listen to what you have to say. They are signaling that they believe you understand their perspective. You are now on the same page. You are now ready to move the discussion forward.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Good programmers are good at forecasting. They can often predict roughly how long it’ll take to accomplish a particular programming task. They can also predict when and to what extent a project will see ROI from a particular technical investment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this skill isn’t guaranteed to develop as we gain more experience programming. In <em>Superforecasters</em>, the authors note that many experienced people are surprisingly bad at making forecasts and that time and experience often don’t make us any better.</p>
<p>They present a framework for how to improve as a forecaster, and since <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs/">I’ve started my new job</a>, I’ve been using that framework.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I’ve seen a small — but measurable — improvement in my forecasting ability, and I’d like to share the specifics around how I’ve used this framework to that effect.

Then I’ll get into how I’m using a simple google spreadsheet and some slack reminders to track my progress within that framework.</p>

<p>Forecasts, in this framework, are probabilistic predictions that a certain event will occur by a certain time. For example, I might say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m 75% confident that I’ll finish programming task X by the end of the week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, to take an ROI-related example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m 85% confident that refactoring code in this file will facilitate future product changes within 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the forecasted event occurs, we assign that event a <code>1</code>. If it doesn’t occur, we assign it a <code>0</code>. Once we do that, measuring whether a particular forecast was a good one is easy: we simply take the squared difference between our probabilistic prediction and the value we’ve assigned the event after the deadline has passed.</p>
<p>Continuing with the above programming task example: if I didn’t actually accomplish the task by the end of the week, the quality value we’ll give to the forecast will be:</p>





<p>We’re basically taking the squared error of our forecast here, so a lower value means that our forecast was actually closer to the truth.</p>
<p>As we make <code>N</code> forecasts, we can simply take the mean of the sum of the squared errors of our predictions:</p>





<p>This is called a “Brier score.”</p>
<h2 id="my-spreadsheet--reminders">My spreadsheet + reminders</h2>
<p>I’m using a spreadsheet to apply this framework in two ways. First, it allows me to easily enter forecasts and calculate a rolling brier score from my last 10 forecasts. I’m also using it to graph my brier score over time. I’ll quickly cover how those things are working in this section.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet looks like this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prediction summary</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Confidence</th>
<th>Came true?</th>
<th>Prediction Squared Error</th>
<th>Brier Score</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Finish programming task X</td>
<td>10/31/20</td>
<td>.85</td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Refactoring will facilitate product work</td>
<td>1/31/20</td>
<td>.75</td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>0.5625</td>
<td>0.3125</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A few quick notes on how this works. <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> are encoded as <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> by Google Sheets the formula for the “Prediction Squared Error” column is a simple subtraction. Also, like I mentioned before, I’m tracking a rolling brier score of the last 10 predictions in the “Brier Score” column. I’ve also got some conditional styling setup to color a row green if it’s time fill in the actual outcome for a more long-range prediction:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/conditional-styling.png" alt="example of conditional styling"></p>
<p>Of course, it’s pretty trivial to create a graph of this. Here’s what mine looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/over-time.png" alt="example brier score over time"></p>
<p>I’ve also setup some simple daily slack reminders to tell me to keep this spreadsheet updated. One reminder tells me to make predictions at the beginning of the day, the other one tells me to record whether those predictions were accurate at the end of the day:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/remind1.png" alt="example reminder 1">
<img src="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/remind2.png" alt="example reminder 2"></p>
<p>This framework, spreadsheet, and graph together make it abundantly clear whether I’m actually improving as a forecaster/programmer, and it prompts reflection on whether I’m making the same mistakes over and over again (I recently added a notes column to each prediction so I can record <em>why</em> it was a good or bad prediction). I’d recommend it to anyone who’s interested in improving as a forecaster and as a programmer.</p>

    <p>As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates issued by 122 different organizations from 47 countries. This number is quite high, and has been steadily growing over the last few years. And it turns out many of those certificates are not needed at all by the vast majority of Windows users, can be distrusted with no ill effects of any sort.</p>

<p>Each of these CAs is given tremendous power over your Internet traffic, so it makes great sense to minimize the number of CAs your computer trusts. 
One simple way to achieve this goal is to replace the default Windows list of root CAs with the much stricter Mozilla trust list, which includes 142 roots (52 organizations - 21 countries). An even stricter option is using the Google CTL, which currently includes just 127 root certificates (48 organizations - 21 countries). For the vast majority of users, applying either set is a great way to reduce your exposure to unnecessary CAs, with no negative impact whatsoever.</p>

<p>Replacing the default Windows list of root CAs with the Mozilla or Google trust lists can be done manually, but is extremely time-consuming and error prone. 
The free version of RootIQ(*) offers a much simpler way to perform this system change:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set
2. Right-click the selection and click Invert selection
3. Right-click the selection and click Distrust
   Click Yes on the confirmation dialog
   This will distrust all roots that are not part of the Mozilla trust set, except for any Microsoft OS-critical roots.
4. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set (again)
5. Right-click the selection and Trust
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://nsa40.casimages.com/img/2020/10/17/201017023914436079.png" alt="img123"></p>

<p>As of this writing, on a standard Windows 10 system, you will end up with 145 trusted roots (rather than 322 roots for the default Microsoft CTL)</p>

<p>(*) RootIQ, our own root certificate manager for Windows, is now <a href="https://www.metasudo.com/">available</a>. A free version of RootIQ is available for home and evaluation use.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>We need to start getting some experience with using Ubuntu 20.04</h2>

	<p><small>October 18, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Under normal circumstances, we would have a decent number of machines
running Ubuntu 20.04 by now, probably including our login servers.
But the situation is not normal, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">ongoing world and local
events</a> still have
us working from home, making it not so simple to install and deploy
a new physical server with a new version of Ubuntu. However, it
really looks like this is the new normal so we should start dealing
with it.</p>

<p>It may or may not make sense to spend limited in-office time upgrading
perfectly good 18.04 machines to 20.04 (I speculated about this <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/Ubuntu2004MaybeMostlySkipping">back
here in early August</a>), although I
suspect we're going to wind up doing some of it. I think it does make
sense to install completely new machines on Ubuntu 20.04 for more
lifetime, and we're certainly going to have some of those. We have what
I believe is a working 20.04 install system, but what we don't currently
have are any continuously running 20.04 machines, especially ones that
normal people can use, explore, and see what's broken or odd. In the
past actually operating new versions of Ubuntu has frequently turned up
surprises, so the sooner we start doing that the better.</p>

<p>The obvious thing to do is to build a few 20.04 test servers. We're
likely going to run Apache on some 20.04 machines, so one test server
should have an Apache install. Another one should be a general login
server, which would let us look into how various programs that people
use behave on 20.04. We should also build a third server that's
completely expendable and we can experiment with rebooting and other
things that may blow up. All of these have to be built on physical
hardware, since we don't currently have any virtualization environment
(and anyway we'd be running most 20.04 machines on physical hardware).</p>

<p>(Running on actual physical hardware has periodically turned up
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/RatelimitKernelMessages">practical problems</a>. Since it's now eight
years after that issue, perhaps we should experiment with no longer
supplying that kernel parameter in 20.04.)</p>

<p>PS: An expendable test server is where it would be very nice to
have some way to roll back the root filesystem to an initial state.
This can apparently be done through LVM, which Ubuntu does support
for the root filesystem, and I may experiment with it following eg
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Create_root_filesystem_snapshots_with_LVM">the Arch wiki</a>.</p>

<p>(This is one of the entries that I write partly to motivate myself
to start working on something. We've been mostly ignoring Ubuntu
20.04 so far and it would be very easy to keep on doing so.)</p>

<p>Hi, I know it’s been a while.  I recently had to nuke and re-pave my personal laptop and I thought it would be a nice thing to share with the community how I set up OpenBSD on it so that I have a useful, modern, secure environment for getting work done.  I’m not going to say I’m the expert on this or that this is the BEST way to set up OpenBSD, but I thought it would be worthwhile for folks doing Google searches to at least get my opinion on this.  So, given that, let’s go…</p>



<p>After downloading the install67.fs image from my favorite site (<a href="https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64">https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</a>) I write it to a USB drive on Linux with:</p>



<p>$ sudo dd if=install67.fs of=/dev/sdc bs=1M</p>



<p>I then boot off of that USB drive and drop to a (s)hell at the install prompt.  From there, I create the full disk encryption container for my install:</p>



<p># cd /dev<br># chmod +x ./MAKEDEV<br># ./MAKEDEV sd1<br># fdisk -iy sd1<br># disklabel -E sd1</p>



<p>Create one big “a” partition for the whole drive but specify RAID as the partition type.</p>



<p># bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd1a softraid0</p>



<p>I then enter my decryption password and type ‘exit’ to restart the installation.  The only tweak I make to the installer is to set up my wifi (it won’t work in the installer or on reboot for me because I have an Intel ‘iwm’ device that needs the firmware installed – I do that later) and make sure that my /usr partition is at least 200g in size (I probably should but I don’t create the subdirectory mount points, just one big /usr).</p>



<p>After the first reboot, I go back to my Linux box with the same USB drive, turn it into a single partition FAT32 drive and download the firmware for my Intel ‘iwm’ device from <a href="https://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/6.7">https://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/6.7</a> as a single .tgz file that I place on that USB drive.  I then mount the drive on OpenBSD:</p>



<p># mount /dev/sd2i /mnt</p>



<p>Next, I copy the .tgz file to the /etc directory and expand it there.  It will automatically put the right files in the /etc/firmware directory.  I then reboot and should have WiFi.  I then update the other firmware:</p>



<p># fw_update</p>



<p>Next, I run syspatch to ensure that I’m fully patched on the kernel and userland I’m running:</p>



<p># syspatch</p>



<p>That takes a bit of time, just be patient.  At this point, it’s best to reboot because so much has changed on the disk from what is running in memory.  You should see in the dmesg output that all of your firmware installed successfully and that the kernel relinked to help fight off potential ROP attackers.</p>



<p>First things first, I create an /etc/doas.conf file so that I can run everything in my regular user account:</p>



<p># echo “permit persist keepenv MY_USERNAME as root” &gt; /etc/doas.conf</p>



<p>Next, I set up power management (because I’m running on a laptop):</p>



<p># rcctl enable apmd<br># rccl set apmd flags -A<br># rcctl start apmd</p>



<p>Since I run development tools and the owncloud desktop, I have to tweak some values in /etc/login.conf to make things work the way I want them to.  First, I add myself to the “staff” group:</p>



<p># usermod -G staff MY_USERNAME</p>



<p>I then edit /etc/login.conf in the “staff” section to make the following changes:</p>



<p># pkg_add vim<br># vim /etc/login.conf</p>



<p>…<br>staff:\<br>    :datasize-cur=4096M:\<br>    :datasize-max=infinity:\<br>    :maxproc-max=512:\<br>    :maxproc-cur=256:\<br>    :openfiles-max=102400:\<br>    :openfiles-cur=102400</p>



<p>I also modify /etc/sysctl.conf to include the line:</p>



<p>kern.maxfiles=102400</p>



<p>I then will typically reboot to pick up the changes.</p>



<p>Next, I want to install the Gnome desktop environment and the Gnome display manager.  It’s what I’m most comfortable in and I know it’s a pain in the you know what for the port maintainers to keep it working on OpenBSD because of the Linux-ism’s that keep creeping in so I want to put in a shout out to them for all of their hard work on this.</p>



<p># pkg_add gnome gnome-tweaks gnome-extras<br># rcctl disable xenodm<br># rcctl enable multicast messagebus avahi_daemon gdm</p>



<p>Install my favorite applications and utilities:</p>



<p># pkg_add firefox chromium libreoffice owncloudclient<br># pkg_add keepassxc aisleriot evolution evolution-ews<br># pkg_add tor-browser shotwell gimp</p>



<p>I will reboot at this point and go into Gnome with the default theme.  That needs fixing so I download the yaru-remix-complete theme from <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/">https://www.gnome-look.org</a> and install it manually by doing the following:</p>



<p>$ cd ~<br>$ mkdir .themes<br>$ cd .themes<br>$ mv ~/Downloads/Yaru-remix-complete.tar.xz .<br>$ unxz Yaru-remix-complete.tar.xz<br>$ tar xf Yaru-remix-complete.tar<br>$ mv themes/* .<br>$ rmdir themes<br>$ doas mv icons/* /usr/local/share/icons<br>$ rmdir icons<br>$ doas mv wallpaper/* /usr/local/share/backgrounds/gnome<br>$ rmdir wallpaper<br>$ rm Yaru-remix-complete.tar</p>



<p>Fire up gnome-tweaks and from “Extensions” turn on “user-themes”.  Close and restart gnome-tweaks, go to the “Appearance” tab and select “Yaru-remix-dark” for “Applications”, “Icons” and “Shell”.  ON “Top Bar”, turn on “Battery Percentage” and “Weekday”.  In “Window Titlebars” enable “Maximize” and “Minimize”.</p>



<p>Enable the extension “Dash to Dock” by downloading it from <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/</a> and pick the right shell version and extension version to match your install of Gnome shell.  You will have to manually install it because the Gnome shell extension integration doesn’t appear to be enabled for OpenBSD:</p>



<p>$ cd ~/Downloads<br>$ unzip dash-to-docmicxgx.gmail.com.v67.shell-extension.zip<br>$ cat metadata.json</p>



<p>The value for “uuid” is what you want to use next:</p>



<p>$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com<br>$ cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com<br>$ unzip ~/Downloads/dash-to-docmicxgx.gmail.com.v67.shell-extension.zip</p>



<p>Reboot to restart Gnome shell, log in, start gnome-tweaks, navigate to the “Extensions” tab and enable dash to dock.  From the settings gear icon, select “extend to edge…” and you should have a very serviceable dock that is quite similar to Ubuntu 20.04’s.</p>



<p>Finally, switch the terminal to “Green on Black” for a better look in the terminal.  Pin your favorite apps to the dock and you should be good to go.</p>

October 19, 2020 | http://rumpelsepp.org/blog/ssh-through-websocket/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://rumpelsepp.org/blog/ssh-through-websocket/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Have you ever been in a restricted corporate network where the only way to reach the internet is a dumb HTTP Proxy?
It sucks.
That’s why i wrote <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rumpelsepp/webcat"><code>webcat</code></a>.
Webcat aims to be the swiss army knife for websocket connections as <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1"><code>netcat</code></a> is for plain TCP.
It does not aim to provide a shitload of features as <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat"><code>websocat</code></a> does.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>webcat</code> does the same as <code>nc</code> does, but for websockets.
It can spawn a server, or act as a client.
Below are a few examples of how to use <code>webcat</code> to raise your attention.
In order to use <code>webcat</code> on a server, a reverse proxy like <code>nginx</code> or <code>caddy</code> with TLS is desired.
I will not go into the correct configuration of such a reverse proxy.</p>
<h2 id="socks-tunnel-via-ssh">SOCKS Tunnel via SSH</h2>
<p><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh"><code>openssh</code></a> provides the <code>-D</code> flag.
With this flag, <code>openssh</code> connects to the remote host as usual, but additionally it spawns a local SOCKS server.
This SOCKS server can be used by arbitrary software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to perform a dynamic port forwarding.
As the manpage explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words you can access the internet through a SSH tunnel which is in a Websocket tunnel which goes over your fancy corporate shit proxy.
<code>-N</code> and <code>-T</code> is useful of you want to disable the pty and shell functionality for this ssh session.
In order to use the Websocket tunnel, <code>webcat</code> will be used via the <code>ProxyCommand</code> setting:</p>
<p>First, a few preparations are required.
On the server webcat.example.org, <code>webcat</code> must be listening like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ webcat -l 127.0.0.1:4444 -p /ssh -t 127.0.0.1:22
</code></pre><p>On a webserver like <a href="https://caddyserver.com/"><code>caddy</code></a> a config snippet like this is required:</p>
<pre><code>reverse_proxy /ssh localhost:4444
</code></pre><p>nginx requires this:</p>
<pre><code>location /ssh {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4444;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
}
</code></pre><p>Now the following forwarding on the server is established:</p>
<pre><code>port 443 -&gt; caddy &lt;-&gt; webcat &lt;-&gt; ssh port 22
</code></pre><p>Now this whole setup can be used like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -NT -D 127.0.0.1:1080 -o 'ProxyCommand=webcat -k 25 -t wss://webcat.example.org/ssh' user@example.org
</code></pre><p>Eventually, the internet can be accessed via example.org like this<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code>$ all_proxy=socks5://localhost:1080 curl https://google.de
</code></pre><h2 id="reverse-tunnel-via-ssh">Reverse Tunnel via SSH</h2>
<p>With the preparation from the previous example a reverse tunnel is straightforward.
A reverse tunnel has these three parties: Target (T), Server (S), and Initiator (I).
In this scenario, I wants to connect to T who is behind a corporate firewall, NAT, and a lot of virus scanners.
To solve this problem I jumps over S to T.
This solution works only, if T is connected to S and maintains this connection to be reachable.
Since the connection between S and T is also “secured” by a shitty HTTP proxy, it must be tunneled through <code>webcat</code>.
<code>webcat</code> understands any HTTP or SOCKS proxy configuration and uses it automatically.</p>
<h3 id="t---s">T &lt;-&gt; S</h3>
<p>Let’s do a reverse port forwarding with SSH through Websocket and expose this connection on a UNIX domain socket <strong>on the server</strong>.
It is a bit more secure to not open any ports on the server.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -o 'ProxyCommand=./webcat -k 25 -t wss://webcat.example.org/ssh/' -TN -R "reverse.sock":localhost:22 user@example.org
</code></pre><h3 id="i---s">I &lt;-&gt; S</h3>
<p>Thats easy.
Forward a local port (e.g. 2222) to the previously opened unix domain socket <code>reverse.sock</code>.
If a Websocket tunnel is desired, just set <code>ProxyCommand</code> as well.
I omit it here.</p>
<p>On your local machine you create a local portforwarding to your server.
This portforwarding connects to the reverse tunnel to the target.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -TN -L 2222:reverse.sock user@example.org
</code></pre><h3 id="i---t">I &lt;-&gt; T</h3>
<p>Connect to the local port 2222 which:</p>
<ul>
<li>forwards to S</li>
<li>is piped into <code>reverse.socks</code></li>
<li>which is connected to the reverse tunnel to T on port 22</li>
<li>which goes through the <code>webcat</code> tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<p>On your local machine you can now connect to your local portforwarding with:</p>

<p>The Monday terror intensifies as the weekend nears, the uneasiness reaches its peak on Sunday. Instead of being cheerful, the weekend slips away by dreading the inevitable day. The mere thought about it breaks the brittle bliss house that I hope to stay in on weekends. I wonder why do I hate it so much.</p>
<p>I love writing computer programs and build cool things. I am doing what I always wanted to do - <em>follow my passion</em>. I thought building my career around my passion would be great as it is the holy grail that everybody seeks, after all, you know the quote -<br>
<em>“Do what you love, and you’ll never work another day in your life”</em></p>
<p>I recently came across interesting research done by <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/18/weve-broken-down-your-entire-life-into-years-spent-doing-tasks_a_23248153/">HuffPost Australia</a> about the total percentage of time an average individual spends on throughout their life. Being “in bed” tops the chart, “work” comes in at second place chomping 24% of your entire life. The percentage would soar if you counted the entire workdays (Monday to Friday) as work, because even though you are physically “done for the day”, the mind isn’t at ease.</p>
<p>I wonder what change brought forth this hate for office work, or should I say the lack of change thereof? This is not a blog post about questioning the purpose of life, rather making the 24% of it less miserable.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of working is to earn money which would then be used to buy happiness. We work by the framework defined by the society we live in, mostly 9-5 from Monday to Friday. We follow this system (loop) throughout our life, chasing wealth which would supposedly buy happiness.</p>
<p>What brings happiness to me are the small things that I would do for joy and not for the sake of money, computer programming was one of them. Doing the same thing as part of my job doesn’t bring the same pleasure as before. Even though career-wise I’m doing good, at least for me putting my passion in a 9 to 5 box has surely made it to fade.</p>
<p>If you have reasons to hate Monday, please share in the comments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <section>
          <p><strong>You should use punctuation in Slack.</strong> You should also use complete sentences and proper grammar. You should expand acronyms<sup>[1]</sup> and — when communicating emotion — even mix in some emoji for effect. You should do that not just in Slack, but in all of your professional communication.</p>

<hr>

<p>Written communication is hard, but in the digital world we work in it’s also vital. Sadly, the style of communication that services like Slack incentivize is awful.</p>

<p>To voice an opinion before the conversation moves on, you type fast and use abbreviations and hit send even with misspellings. You think one message at a time. You bounce between different threads and become easily distracted.</p>

<p>There are some obvious downsides to this fast and loose style. Most notably, it interrupts more productive work and deters deep thinking. But one large and often overlooked downside is the impact it has on others.</p>

<h2 id="externalities">Externalities</h2>

<p>When you use an obscure initialism or take shortcuts on grammar and spelling, it may save you a couple seconds. The problem is those small savings are often outweighed by the cost born by your audience.</p>

<p>Every person who reads your message spends some finite period of time interpreting what you’re saying. Setting aside the possibility that a sloppy message might lead the reader to an incorrect interpretation, it’s harder to parse messages written hastily — messages with poor grammar, misspellings, minimal punctuation, obscure acronyms, or delivered a few words at a time.</p>

<p>As an example, assume you send the following message to a Slack channel with 10 other people in it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>anyone know the latest on cai
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And further assume that “cai” refers to an internal project: <strong>C</strong>rusade <strong>A</strong>gainst <strong>I</strong>nitialisms. By writing in all lower case, using an initialism to refer to the project, and omitting the question mark, you’ve saved yourself two words and a handful of extra keystrokes. Under the most generous assumptions, say that translates to five seconds in savings. That’s a lot!</p>

<p>But let’s now examine the impact the shortcuts have on your 10-person audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two people thought “cai” was a typo and spent several moments trying to guess what you actually meant to type before realizing you were referring to the internal project. <em>Cost: 20 seconds</em></li>
  <li>Two people didn’t know what “cai” stood for. One spent three minutes tracking it down on the internal wiki, and the other sent a private message to another team member to ask. <em>Cost: 4 minutes</em></li>
  <li>One person ignored your ask because they didn’t realize it was a question when scanning the channel. <em>Cost: Priceless</em></li>
  <li>Five people understood what you meant but still had to mentally expand the initialism before internalizing your ask. <em>Cost: 5 seconds</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Your 5 seconds of savings amounted to roughly 4.5 <em>minutes</em> of cost spread across your audience. Sure, this is a contrived example and sure there are cases where the cost is lower, but the point stands: <strong>your communication shortcuts are costly</strong>.</p>

<p>In economics, this phenomena is referred to as a negative externality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A negative externality is the cost that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you take a communication shortcut, you are inflicting a micro-externality on your audience. The more egregious the shortcut, the larger the externality; the larger your audience, the more times the externality is multiplied and the larger the overall cost.</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>If you’re communicating with a close friend and choose to use shorthand, you’re probably fine. Not only will your friend probably be accustomed to it (i.e. the externality will be small), but the audience is also small (i.e. the total cost will be small). In this case, it’s entirely possible your shorthand saves you more time than it costs your friend.</p>

<p>However, when you’re communicating in a one-to-many setting such as email or Slack, and particularly in a professional setting, sloppy writing<sup>[2]</sup> has real consequences. It prioritizes your time above the time of <em>every other person</em> that will be reading that message and might misinterpret your intent or tone. In aggregate, it is a net drain on productivity at your company.</p>

<p>So use proper spelling and grammar. Write out your entire thought before hitting send. Expand acronyms. Use punctuation.</p>

<p>A period, even at the end of “Do it,” communicates, “I’ve said everything I wanted to say.”</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] For the sticklers out there, this includes initialisms as well as acronyms.</p>
<p>[2] The term "sloppy" might sound harsh, but I chose it deliberately. Not everyone speaks the company language (e.g. English) natively, and for them using proper spelling or grammar might be challenging to say the least. The argument here is scoped to people who have some degree of mastery over the language but are being <em>sloppy</em> with their written communication, which is to say "careless and unsystematic; excessively casual".</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>I started writing this post when being very very annoyed by <a href="https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/10/12/from-heavy-metal-to-irrational-exuberance/">this blog post</a> on the SIGPLAN blog.
I could not understand how “THE SIGPLAN” blog
could simply write 30 years of
programming language research out of existence,
only barely acknowledging Self and JavaScript.
It felt like <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">duty called</a>…</p>

<p>Though, after multiple rounds of edits,
I am now assuming that there’s simply an issue of awareness.
What follows is therefore an attempt to raise awareness on the various
academic but also industrial efforts around the performance of dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this blog post isn’t attempting to be complete in any way,
but I hope it provides enough pointers for people interested in
<em>language implementation technology for dynamic languages</em>
to go deeper and possibly even contribute.</p>

<h2 id="languages-vs-language-implementations">Languages vs. Language Implementations</h2>

<p>Before going into technical details,
it is important to start distinguishing between
a language and its implementation.
Especially, when we talk about programming language research,
these two are rarely the same.</p>

<p>While the languages mentioned in the post (Python, R, PHP) all have
“standard” implementations, which are the by far most widely used ones,
they are far from the only implementations.
Let’s just pick three for each language:
There are PyPy, IronPython, and Jython for Python,
pqR, Renjin, and FastR for R,
as well as HippyVM, PeachPie, and Quercus for PHP.</p>

<p>They all have benefits and drawbacks. And perhaps are not even 100% compatible,
but various groups of people clearly spent a lot of time and energy on
more optimized language implementations. Some of these implementations have
state-of-the-art just-in-time compilers and can reach performance competitive
with JavaScript, which itself is certainly competitive with for instance Java,
and only slightly behind “metal” languages in some, and ahead in other benchmarks.</p>

<p>How do I know? I didn’t benchmark all of these language implementations,
but I worked on comparing compilers across languages with the <a href="https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/">Are We Fast Yet project</a> [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/dls16-marr-et-al-cross-language-compiler-benchmarking-are-we-fast-yet.pdf">5</a>].
One important insight here is that language design can definitely have
a performance impact. But, the ingenuity of compiler writers
and language implementers has eliminated all major performance hurdles
in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>This means, claims about the <em>languages</em> for instance them
being “all notoriously slow and bloated” and “not designed to be fast or space-efficient”
are rather misguided.</p>

<p>Just-in-time compilation technology as used for JavaScript, Java, Python
and others is very effective, and not particularly language-specific.
Some of the key techniques have been known
for 30 years, <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/08/optimizing-the-unoptimizable-using-old-ideas/">as I discussed elsewhere</a>.
Others, such as <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43823/">mementos</a>,
and <a href="http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Papers/Stadler14/Stadler2014-CGO-PEA.pdf">partial escape analysis</a> are much more recent and help with many issues.
Perhaps interesting to note is that storage strategies were actually
first done in PyPy, and are now pretty much standard in just-in-time compiling
VMs for a whole range of languages, including JavaScript.</p>

<p>Though, one may argue that these techniques have not been successful enough,
because people don’t use the language implementations actually benefiting from
them.</p>

<p>Fine, but I believe this is only partially a technical problem.
Some of it is a social issue, too.</p>

<p>Others have spent time on identifying potential reasons
of why people do not pick up our research. For instance, Laurie wrote blog posts
on why not more users are happy with our VMs [<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_2.html">2</a>].</p>

<p>Given the claim that JavaScript is somehow exceptional,
I would argue that JavaScript was lucky in a way.
JavaScript was hilariously slow to start with.
For V8 this meant that they didn’t have to worry about making “startup performance”
worse. Their baseline native code compiler
produced code that was much better than the JavaScript interpreters
back then. Perhaps unfortunately, Python has a surprisingly fast interpreter,
which gives VMs such as PyPy quite a challenge.
Still, it is not impossible to beat such interpreters and have
just-in-time compiling VMs that have also good startup performance.
Examples are indeed modern JavaScript VMs, but also much smaller
and less well funded projects such as <a href="https://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>,
which has an incredibly fast interpreter and a very effective just-in-time compiler.
But indeed, it takes time and effort to build these systems,
which contrary to the claims in the blog post,
are indeed invested in these languages.</p>

<h2 id="is-python-doomed-of-course-not">Is Python doomed? Of course not!</h2>

<p>So, what about Python then?
The blog post picks up a claim that Python is incredibly slow when it comes
to matrix multiplication. And later, without much context claims that PyPy
is perhaps 2 times faster than Python, but sometimes slower.</p>

<p>One could have asked the PyPy community,
or looked at <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/06/repeating-matrix-multiplication.html">their blog</a>. PyPy doesn’t have auto-vectorization as far as I know,
so, indeed, it has a hard time reaching the performance of vectorized code,
but it is much faster than what’s implied.
Such broad claims are not just unjustified and bad style,
they are also painfully unscientific.
No, Python is not necessarily slow and bloated.
<a href="https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/implementation.pdf">Maps</a>,
<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/14">Hidden Classes</a>,
and <a href="https://chrisseaton.com/rubytruffle/pppj14-om/pppj14-om.pdf">object shapes</a>
make it possible to store even integers rather efficiently.
With the previously mentioned
<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>,
this works extremely well for your hugh array with integers, too.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps more important is the questions whether auto-vectorization is something
dynamic languages simply can’t support.
Again, there’s no fundamental reason why VMs for dynamic languages can’t support it.
The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a> supports auto-vectorization
and can speedup JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and other dynamic languages with it.
Key techniques are speculative compilation, type feedback, object shapes, and
storage strategies.
With them, optimistic compilers can vectorize even
the code of dynamic languages.
For good measures, I should probably also mention <a href="https://jjfumero.github.io/publications/">Juan Fumero’s work</a> around using just-in-time compilation for dynamic languages to target GPUs.</p>

<h2 id="are-dynamic-languages-single-threaded">Are Dynamic-Languages Single Threaded?</h2>

<p>This one, I do indeed take personally.</p>

<p>First of all, being effectively single threaded can be a Good Thing™.
Why would you want to deal with shared memory race conditions?
This is a language design question. So in the end a matter of taste.
And, if one really wants to, <a href="http://stefan-marr.de/downloads/comlan-de-koster-et-al-domains-sharing-state-in-the-communicating-event-loop-actor-model.pdf">some forms of shared memory are possible,
even without introducing all its drawbacks</a>.</p>

<p>That aside, Python, R, and others have fairly nice ways of supporting parallelism, including multiprocess approaches.
And, to blow my own horn a little more, if you really want shared memory multithreading, you can have that efficiently, too with our work on thread-safe object models [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla16-daloze-et-al-efficient-and-thread-safe-objects-for-dynamically-typed-languages.pdf">3</a>] and thread-safe storage strategies [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla18-daloze-et-al-parallelization-of-dynamic-languages-synchronizing-built-in-collections.pdf">4</a>] .</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To sum up: yes, metal languages will continue to be important, but so will the irrational exuberance languages. We as a community should lead the way in developing systems (at the hardware and software levels) that will make them run faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we should. And the PL community spent a lot of effort doing this for the last 30 years.
So, please join us. We are out there and could use help!</p>

<p><a href="https://mplr2020.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/mplr/program">MPLR</a> has a keynote coming up titled “Hardware Support for Managed Languages: An Old Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come?”.
Perhaps worth <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdONvpOEBMtVqvwK9W_IqYMa0uiLSNX79Olrz6H4sk62KuJnw/viewform">registering for</a>. Attendance is free.</p>

<p>And of course, SPLASH is around the corner, too.
With <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/dls-2020">DLS</a> and <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2020">VMIL</a>, SPLASH has a strong history of providing venues for discussing
the implementation of dynamic languages.
OOPSLA, as in the past, has pretty cool papers on <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla20-j.pdf">dynamic</a> <a href="https://www.o1o.ch/about/assets/cd.pdf">language</a> <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/details/splash-2020-oopsla/50/Hidden-Inheritance-An-Inline-Caching-Design-for-TypeScript-Performance">implementation</a>.</p>

<p>Other relevant venues include for instance <a href="https://2019.ecoop.org/series/ICOOOLPS">ICOOOLPS</a> and <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/series/MoreVMs">MoreVMs</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/06/efficient-and-safe-implementations-of-dynamic-languages/">Introduction to Efficient and Safe Implementations of Dynamic Languages</a> has many pointers
to research, some of which also made it into <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/tmp/bibtex.html">some early overview of the field</a>.</p>

<p>For questions or difference in opinion, find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/smarr/">@smarr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="post-scriptum">Post Scriptum</h2>

<p>Part of my annoyance with the blog post is its dismissive and condescending tone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of these so-called “scripting languages” are essentially moribund, like Perl (1987)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems a completely unnecessary point to be made.
It is also unclear how this is assessed. The Perl community is active,
but yes, a lot of effort went into
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/08/is-perl-6-being-renamed.html">Raku</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, it describes “JavaScript is an outlier”, refers to the
“monoculture [of] (the browser)”, and says there’s “no need for compatibility with legacy code”.
JavaScript is certainly an interesting special case,
and indeed, as acknowledged, browsers just happen to have attracted a lot of funding.
But a monoculture? In which sense? At least in the past,
“the browser” itself was rather diverse. When it comes to backwards compatibility,
the number one design goal of Ecma TC39, the group designing JavaScript,
is “don’t break the web”.</p>

<p>And of course, browsers themselves are incredibly complex “legacy systems”.
To get a taste, I’d recommend to listen to <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/dls-2019/dls-2019/1/Untangling-the-web-Memory-management-in-Chrome-s-web-platform-implementation">Michael Lippautz</a>
talking about how C++ and JavaScript interact.</p>

<h2 id="post-post-scriptum">Post Post Scriptum</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python programmers need to distinguish between time and memory spent in pure Python (optimizable) from time and memory spent in C libraries (not so much). They need help tracking down expensive and insidious traffic across the language boundaries (copying and serialization).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3201898">We could also try to get rid of it instead.</a>
Or give more power to people like <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/76576/">Stephen Kell</a>,
and avoid copying/serialization in a different way.</p>

Where does it come from, you might be asking. Often mispronounced, the real backstory of what Kubernetes means starts with a translation. The name originates from Greek, meaning helmsman (you can see that referenced in the logo) or pilot. Google Translate gives the <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82">modern Greek pronunciation</a>, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/j6dv9u/well_this_explains_everything/g7zufar/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit explains the common pronunciation</a> as more similar to ancient Greek. Either way, Flavor Flav puts his own spin on it <a href="https://youtu.be/QxvmO-QlxJQ?t=27">here</a>.</p><p>Okay, now on to the technical stuff. First, let's define Kubernetes.</p><blockquote><strong>Kubernetes</strong> is a DevOps software development tool built and supported by Google to enable teams to simplify the management of deploying updates and services in a distributed system.</blockquote><p>Phew, that is a lot of techie words, but to simplify that: Gone are the days for having to have one giant compute machine on Amazon to support all your running containers. (Or worse, multiple identical giant compute machines holding everything imaginable because you needed more services that help user John_63_xyz to see his dashboard and upload his profile photo... okay, you get the point.)</p><p>Next, containers. A container is a standardized unit of software. If you are hung-up on what containers are, I strongly encourage you to give <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">this article</a> by Docker a read and then come back. You can also peek the graphic below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container-what-is-container.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The advantages of running containerized code are innumerable and it is well established as an industry best practice, but in short: <strong>Containerization</strong> allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely than before.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container_evolution.svg"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>With traditional methods, code is developed into a specific computing environment that when transferred to a new location often results in bugs and errors.</p><p>Containerization also reduces wasted resources because each container only holds the application and related binaries or libraries. Simply by allowing more containers in the environment without the need for more servers, containerization increases scalability up to 100 times that of traditional VM environments.</p><p>Getting back to Kubernetes and what it is, it is a tool used for container orchestration. Meaning that it is one point of reference that you can "talk to" to access ANY of the services that you have running on your Kubernetes cluster. Even if those services are across different machines. Pretty great, yeah?</p><h2 id="so-what-does-kubernetes-do-exactly"><strong>So What Does Kubernetes Do Exactly?</strong></h2><p>EVERYTHING... for deployment and maintenance needs. Historically (not speaking ftp), the deployment process looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Code review is approved and changes are merged into master</li><li>ssh into your Amazon EC2 instance holding the git repo for your application</li><li>cd into your project directory</li><li>^C to stop application</li><li>git pull origin master</li><li>&lt;application start command&gt;</li><li>Hope it works out 🤞</li></ol><p>Over the years, the process has improved with Docker and docker-compose to run images of the application in containers instead of the application on bare metal, but it still follows the same steps as above.</p><p>Alternatively, if using Kubernetes, you can run <code>kubectl apply -f {deployment yaml}</code> to directly target ALL services on ALL machines of the specified type in your deployment yaml file and apply the new image(s) from your local machine (depending on the privileges you setup for the connection to your cluster).</p><p>On top of it being one line, it applies the update in a rollout fashion, meaning that it shuts down the services one at a time as it applies the new changes.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-to-add-new-services-not-defined-in-the-cluster"><strong>W<strong><strong>hat </strong></strong>i<strong><strong>f I </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>eed to </strong></strong>A<strong><strong>dd </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ew </strong></strong>S<strong><strong>ervices </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ot </strong></strong>D<strong><strong>efined in </strong></strong>the<strong><strong> </strong></strong>C<strong><strong>luster?</strong></strong></strong></h3><p>Simple, create a new deployment yaml file for the new service and run the apply command.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-one-of-the-same-service">What if I Need More Than One of the Same Service?</h3><p>Even easier, each service (called a deployment) has a number of pods representing the number of "service instances" that are running that application. Just set that value to be greater than 1, or even better set the "autoscaling" limit to be the maximum number of service instances you want running at a time and let Kubernetes scale the number of instances up and down based on traffic.</p><h3 id="is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-services-that-i-can-run">Is There a Limit on the Number of Services That I Can Run?</h3><p>Yes and no. Your Kubernetes cluster manages which machines (called nodes) the new pods get deployed to (and yes you can pair up applications that need to be together), which isn't a problem until there isn't enough space on any of the nodes you have allocated to your cluster. You can correct this by adding more nodes, so the sky and your wallet are the limit.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-setup-a-kubernetes-cluster-for-my-application">How Do I Setup a Kubernetes Cluster for My Application?</h2><p>There are a number of ways for setting up a Kubernetes cluster for your application ranging from bare metal to managed cloud provider solutions. In this article I'm going to point you in the right direction for setting up a managed solution in each of the major cloud providers as well as how to use The Ops Platform to make your life simpler, observable, and streamlined like a <a href="https://cto.ai/blog/slack-control-plane-for-devops-workflows/">Control Plane</a>.</p><h3 id="amazon-web-services-aws-eks"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) EKS</strong></h3><p>According to AWS's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">documentation</a>, there are 2 ways to create a new EKS managed Kubernetes cluster. The first being an officially supported CLI developed by Weaveworks called <code>eksctl</code>. With eksctl, you can spin up a new managed cluster with reasonable defaults just by running <code>eksctl create cluster</code>.</p><p>Pretty easy right? You can also customize the settings on the cluster via the command line or a configuration yaml if you know what you are doing, which adds some complexity. From their <a href="https://eksctl.io/">website</a> it looks like this tool does the heavy lifting from the setup side, but doesn't provide any abstractions over <code>kubectl</code> for pod or deployment maintenance.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>$ eksctl create cluster

Hopefully it’s the first of many. I decided to go with a topic that’s interesting, presently relevant, and leaves lots of room to explore in future posts. So please tweet me </span><a href="https://twitter.com/caervs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>@caervs</span></a><span> to let me know what areas interests you.</span></p><p><span>Many of you will have heard recently that </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Google achieved quantum supremacy</span></a><span>. Many of you also will already know the essential implications of this event, a crucial one being that </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>classical cryptography</span></a><span>, the </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>basis for today’s secure internet</span></a><span>, is on a </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613596/how-a-quantum-computer-could-break-2048-bit-rsa-encryption-in-8-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>path to obsolescence</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you’re like me though, your curiosity doesn’t end there, and for good reason. All of us, engineers, mathematicians, analysts, data scientists, and other users of the internet, will be making big bets at some point in our careers on where to allocate our time, money, and other resources. We deserve an understanding of quantum computing that goes one step beyond the oft described and mystifying idea that qubits are “</span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-quantum-cat-state-can-be-in-two-places-at-once-1779243935" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>in two states at once</span></a><span>.” This post will give you a detailed, qualitative account of quantum computing that is more advanced than a popular science article but more digested than a textbook or research paper.</span></p><p><span>I learned a lot researching this topic and I hope you will learn a lot reading about it. We will start by spending a good amount of time covering how quantum computers fit into the larger landscape of classical computing. These foundations help us to understand quantum, not as a wholy new paradigm, but as a continuation of a long tradition of how we compute. We will dive deep into how the secure internet works so that we can understand how it does not work in a post-quantum world. Then we will learn just enough quantum mechanics to fundamentally understand some important quantum algorithms, meaning I have to leave out A LOT. Still I have tried to make the reading self-contained. Finally we’ll be armed to understand who are the big players in this space today and what they have achieved. Let’s begin!</span></p><h2 id="Part-1-Classical-Computing" data-id="Part-1-Classical-Computing"><a href="#Part-1-Classical-Computing" title="Part-1-Classical-Computing"><span></span></a><span>Part 1: Classical Computing</span></h2><p><strong><span>Three Theories that Shaped History</span></strong></p><p><span>The word “computer” has for most of its life not referred to a machine. The earliest known example of its use in fact </span><a href="https://howtospeakmachine.com/2019/02/24/first-use-of-the-word-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>goes all the way back to 1613</span></a><span>! Back then up throughout the 1900s (see </span><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/ladies-who-launch-the-women-behind-the-apollo-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Apollo program computers</span></a><span>), the word referred to a professional whose work was to process information. Like any other specialists these professional computers created an abstraction for their fellow workers. For computationally intense organizations like the Census Bureau or NASA these “departments of computers” were trained in advanced rules for computation and symbol manipulation. They would take in requests for computations and follow various rules to arrive at and output the desired piece of information. For example if you work in the Census Bureau where county population tables are available you may ask your computers what the total population is per state, an early application for </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/herman-holleriths-tabulating-machine-2504989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>what would eventually become IBM</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The story of how we trained people en masse to solve analytical problems and then ultimately automated their work has unfolded over a thousand years and defined the modern world. Understanding this history gives us a better sense of what are the time-invariant truths of Computer Science and what are just fads. Those of you who are eager to dive into quantum and the secure internet are welcome to skip to </span><a href="#TLS-and-Asymmetric-Ciphers"><span>Part 2.3</span></a><span>. I won’t judge you! In this part we will study three key milestones that gave us the computer, starting with how humans became computers using a program for arithmetic.</span></p><h3 id="Arithmetic-and-Algorithms" data-id="Arithmetic-and-Algorithms"><a href="#Arithmetic-and-Algorithms" title="Arithmetic-and-Algorithms"><span></span></a><span>Arithmetic and Algorithms</span></h3><p><span>In 8th century Arabia a new power had emerged to challenge the old worlds of Persia and Rome. During the hundred years after the death of their first leader, Muhammad, the Arab clans of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayya_ibn_Abd_Shams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ummaya</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_ibn_Abd_al-Muttalib" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Abbas</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ali</span></a><span> would form a vast empire and war amongst themselves to determine who would lead it. When the dust settled in 752 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Al-Mansur</span></a><span> the Abbasid was victorious. This new emperor declared that all books throughout his land should be collected and translated into Arabic and that all wise men of his land should congregate in a new </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>house of wisdom</span></a><span> in Baghdad so that they may discover knowledge to fill new books.</span></p><p><span>Among the scholars of this house was a Persian named </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</span></a><span> (meaning from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarazm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Khwarazm</span></a><span>). His </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>most famous work</span></a><span> on “al jabr” (lit. the balancing) would become today’s algebra, but we’re more interested in his second most famous work, his </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Hindu_Reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Principles of Hindu Reckoning</span></a><span>, which would introduce the West to a program for performing arithmetic, as with an abacus, but no hardware needed. It was thus that the method of al-Khwarizmi </span><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Dixit_algorizmi.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>later transliterated as the “Algorithm”</span></a><span> was born.</span></p><p><span>Khwarizmi’s Indian program is based on what today we would call a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>place value system</span></a><span>. From a finite alphabet of numerals we can represent infinitely many numbers by using place to indicate successively larger groupings of units. Khwarizmi’s work is now extinct unfortunately but from later sources we can reconstruct his program for the addition of numbers </span><code>x</code><span> and </span><code>y</code><span> which should look familiar from grade school.</span></p><pre><code><div><p>Arrange x and y one on top so that their digits are aligned from the right
Track your "carry" digit which is initially 0

Start from the rightmost digit
Add the carry and top and bottom digits (blank is the same as zero)
The ones place from this addition is a next digit of your result
The tens place is your new carry
If there are no more digits, carry is the last digit and you're done
Otherwise move one digit to the left and repeat from step 5
</p></div></code></pre><p><span>Simple enough. We’ll skip running through an example as you all have done addition of two numbers before. You may notice that al-Khwarizmi wrote his numbers with the biggest place at the left and the smallest place at the right just like we do in English despite the fact that he wrote in Persian and Arabic which are both right-to-left languages. Look carefully at the above algorithm and you will realize perhaps surprisingly that it is we who write numbers in the Perso-Arabic style of right-to-left.</span></p><p><span>We start with this simplest of algorithms to unravel the mystery of why algorithms in general work, a question at the heart of computation, quantum or otherwise. To answer this question we’ll move beyond simple pairs of numbers we want to add and start drawing out the whole space of inputs and outputs to addition. When we enumerate this space we start to make a graph like this one</span></p><pre><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->

</pre><p><span>Every circle represents a number that may function as an input to or an output from the algorithm. A square represents the parameters of a specific execution of the algorithm with arrows in denoting input and arrows out denoting output. Of course we have only shown six possible parameter pairs but the full graph goes on infinitely in two (countable) dimensions.</span></p><p><span>Because place value is familiar to us I have labeled the nodes with their decimal representation, but there is nothing extra special about decimal. We could have used a different base than decimal. We could have used tally marks or Roman numerals, spatial relations (brail), or electrical impulses (like computers do). Our choice of representation is somewhat arbitrary. Critically however when we remove labels the underlying structure of the graph always remains the same. It is fundamentally the structure of addition. When we use </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>algebra</span></a><span> in this article we will mean this type of collection of elements and their interrelationships.</span></p><p><span>Whatsmore, for any numerical representation you choose, there is exactly one way to label the elements of the graph. This is because the natural numbers with addition are </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>self-similar</span></a><span> in exactly one way, or stated equivalently they have no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>symmetries</span></a><span>. To see this fact is quite simple. In any representation, "one’ will be the unique value that has no arrows going into it; it is never the output of our addition. “Two” is the sum of one and one. “Three” is the sum of two and one and so on.

</pre><p><span>A graph of numbers without any numbers written on it sounds pretty abstract so let’s remember concretely what we’re doing. In any situation where we’re adding we are taking two </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>disjoint</span></a><span> sets of objects (apples, houses, spears) and asking ourselves how many objects we would have if we </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>combined</span></a><span> the two sets. It is here that our choice of representation starts to matter because not all representations are as easy for us to manipulate. Some take more time, some more space, but all of them have the same graph. The magic of the decimal representation was that it led to a procedure for doing any conceivable addition with a sequence of simple and unambiguous symbol manipulations.</span></p><p><span>To see why this is so special let’s try to do the same thing with another operation we use a lot in cryptography, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>integer factorization</span></a><span>. We’ll start by drawing out the same kind of algebraic graph but for multiplication</span></p><pre><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->

<p>In just five years, rapper Tupac Shakur produced more than 700 songs. By 35, inventor Thomas Edison had more than 100 patents to his name. In his lifetime, author Isaac Asimov wrote nearly 500 books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of these creators was prolific. And each produced some incredibly high-quality work. In creative fields, quality and quantity are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <a href="https://www.animalz.co/blog/content-marketing-strategy/">B2B content strategy</a>, we've all come to accept that we need to "slow down" and focus on quality. Because quantity, the thinking goes, had its moment already. After all, it wasn't so long ago that platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn rewarded content creators who churned out tons of content. Content teams cranked out as much as they could. But it became a race to the bottom and before long, social networks decided giving away free traffic was bad for business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content marketers, by and large, moved their focus to a more established and reliable distribution channel. Someplace where quality can thrive and traffic comes in slowly and predictably over time: <strong>organic search</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite Google's imperfections, most writers I know are far happier writing for search than social. Pieces are worked on for a week or a month instead of an afternoon. Clickbait headlines are passed over in favor of depth and comprehension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what if we all overcorrected? What if prolific writing actually does work? What if quality or quantity isn't a one-or-the other decision? Could content teams benefit from upping their output?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote><p>For about six months in 2015, I was the world's most productive content marketer.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote, edited, and published one article per day. These weren't light pieces either. They were heavily-researched deep dives, anywhere from 800 to 3,500 words. Four years later, many of them still rank on the first page of search results for competitive terms like "creative juices", "asynchronous communication," and "tools to start a business."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An article in the New Yorker recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake" target="_blank">linked to one</a> of these pieces. My first week on the job I was interviewed on a national radio show about one of them. Our approach worked and before long, the <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="iDoneThis (opens in a new tab)">iDoneThis</a> site grew to 400,000 monthly pageviews. This strategy isn't for everyone, but it can work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One piece per day. Here's how I did it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Structure Your Day to Enable Creative Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“In effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.”—Paul Graham.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must have read Paul Graham’s famous “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</a>” piece, where he suggests structuring a day into two blocks of time. One block is for focused creative work, the “maker” side, the other is for the “manager” part of your role like meetings and email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could never have made this work without the maker/manager approach. Writing just requires so much focus and momentum. It’s like pushing a flywheel. It’s hard to get it started, but once it’s spinning it’s hard to stop. You’re best off starting and stopping only once per day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here was what my daily schedule looked like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7:30-8am:</strong> This was a quick skim of email and Slack. I’m talking 15-20 minutes of sitting with a cup of coffee and making sure nothing set on fire overnight or needed my immediate attention. I’m not trying to clear out inboxes yet, just hoping to let the caffeine kick in and give myself some assurance that I can safely slide into maker mode for the next few hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8am-12pm:</strong> The first half of the day was full-on writing mode. Saying you can start and finish anything in just half a day sounds ambitious. And it is when that time’s full of distractions and email. But think about four uninterrupted hours. That’s a lot of time. What’s the last thing you totally focused on for four hours?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I intentionally structured maker time so it would end at lunch. Lunch is a nice finish line and dividing point for the day. It helps to have a few minutes to reset yourself before switching to manager mode. I’d get away from my desk, stretch out, take a walk, have something to eat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other bonus of putting writing time before lunch was that I could always delay lunch and buy myself an extra 60 or 90 minutes of writing time if I needed it. I didn’t quit until I had a draft written, read, read, read again, edited, read again, and in a place where I was confident publishing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>12-12:30pm:</strong> Like I said, lunch. Also, get outside, walk the dog, meet a friend for coffee. Reset my thoughts. This was a fully remote team, so getting some sunshine and seeing other humans was super important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1-5:30pm: </strong>Manager time. Even though the top line in my job description would have been “write blog posts,” there was a lot of work that wasn’t writing which I needed to make time for. Like running our email program, promoting the content, tracking performance, 1:1s with my manager, answering email and Slack, uploading and scheduling content into WordPress. I was also the only person in a marketing role in this startup, so you naturally wind up wearing a lot of hats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manager time typically didn’t take 4.5 hours, thankfully. And there was one more, really key activity during this time that I’ll get to in the next section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Set Strict Rules for Your “Maker” Time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were two things I really didn’t want to happen during writing time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The <strong>first</strong> was that I would sit down in the morning without knowing what I’d be working on, and waste my maker time trying to figure that out.</li><li>The <strong>second</strong> was that I’d start working on a piece, spend half a day on it, realize I didn’t have a strong enough idea and have to scrap it entirely. A lot of pieces sound good as a pitch, but fall apart once you try actually writing it. I didn’t want this to happen.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep both these fears at bay, I developed a strict “validated topics only” rule. That extra time during manager block that I mentioned? Researching and validating. This was for finding research, brainstorming, combing thought ideas and topics, finding the ones with potential and doing enough initial legwork to know the piece would actually hold up. Any extra time after regular manager activities was used for this.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep my system working, I always made sure to <strong>over-communicate the process.</strong> This was a remote team, and a small team, so I had some built-in protection against interruptions. But I still found it helpful to over-communicate my process. I’d talk about the system multiple times with managers and colleagues. I’d set my Slack status to something like “focusing on writing until noon,” I’d block my calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re going to try this, you’ve got to commit, and you’ve got to over-communicate. It simply won't work without large chunks of time every single day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Create a Workflow to Support Your Strategy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like I said, validating before writing was a huge part of making this work. Most content teams have some workflow that goes like this: Ideas, Writing, Editing, Published. I think there’s a missing step between ideas and writing, and that’s <em>validating</em>. Maybe it’s my newspaper background, because when I was a reporter I could never just grab an idea and start writing. I’d have to validate that idea with my editor. Often they would even need to validate it with the other editors in a morning planning meeting before giving me the green light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a big fan of Trello for managing content workflows. My Trello columns looked like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Ideas</li><li>Validating</li><li>Validated</li><li>Writing and editing</li><li>Ready for Wordpress</li><li>Scheduled in Wordpress</li><li>Published</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll just talk about the first three steps, since they are the most important. Why’s that? In any production system, flaws become more costly the further they move down the line. So it’s always more important, and cheaper, to catch errors as early in the production process as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Ideas:</strong> The first column—"Ideas"—was wide open. I’m a proponent of big backlogs and a “no bad ideas” approach. Every idea, even ones you think are bad or half-baked, go on there. A year from now that bad idea might weave together with two new ideas and turn into something great. Large backlogs are a secret weapon for a content program. </li><li><strong>Validating:</strong> The next column—"Validating"—was way more selective. These are topics where I felt like there was potential, and in a less-efficient system I might have just started writing right from here. The idea in "Validating" is to take topics from gut feel to a place where I’ve got some evidence the topic is sound and I’m confident enough to spend a day writing. </li><li><strong>Validated:</strong> From here, topics either move on to "Validated" or back to "Ideas." "Validated" became the column I could pull from at the beginning of each maker block. I could start my day knowing I had a strong topic that wouldn’t fall apart, I had research to work from</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This process wasn't complicated, but it was vital to the success of our strategy. It ensured that I had a distraction-free environment with a team who knew what I was doing. Most of all, it gave me time to write prolifically. And the more I wrote, the better I understood what content drove traffic and leads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not for everyone, but this strategy absolutely can work. If you try it, commit fully, validate every idea and write your heart out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span data-nosnippet="">
<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-9/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. In this thrilling new update, we
will learn a little bit more about x86-64 instruction encoding instead of
allocating more interesting things on the heap or adding procedure calls.</p>

<p>I am writing this interlude because I changed one register in my compiler code
(<code>kRbp</code> to <code>kRsp</code>) and all hell broke loose — the resulting program was
crashing, <code>rasm2</code>/Cutter were decoding wacky instructions when fed my binary,
etc. Over the span of two very interesting but very frustrating hours, I
learned why I had these problems and how to resolve them. You should learn,
too.</p>

<h3 id="state-of-the-instruction-encoder">State of the instruction encoder</h3>

<p>Recall that I introduced at least 10 functions that looked vaguely like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc7</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>src</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions all purport to encode x86-64 instructions. They do, most of the
time, but they do not tell the whole story. This function is supposed to encode
an instruction of the form <code>mov reg64, imm32</code>. How does it do it? I don’t know!</p>

<p>They have all these magic numbers in them! What is a <code>kRexPrefix</code>? Well, it’s
<code>0x48</code>. Does that mean anything to us? No! It gets worse. What are <code>0xc7</code> and
<code>0xc0</code> doing there? Why are we adding <code>dst</code> to <code>0xc0</code>? Before this debugging
and reading extravaganza, I could not have told you. Remember how somewhere in
a previous post I mentioned I was getting these hex bytes from reading the
compiled output on the Compiler Explorer? Yeah.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is not a robust development strategy, at least with
x86-64. It might be okay for some more regular or predictable instruction sets,
but not this one.</p>

<h3 id="big-scary-documentation">Big scary documentation</h3>

<p>So where do we go from here? How do we find out how to take these mystical
hexes and incantations to something that better maps to the hardware? Well, we
once again drag <a href="https://tchebb.me/">Tom</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> into a debugging session and pull
out the big ol’ Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Software Developer Manual</a>.</p>

<p>This is an enormous 26MB, 5000 page manual comprised of four volumes. It’s
<em>very intimidating</em>. This is exactly why I didn’t want to pull it out earlier
and do this properly from the beginning… but here we are, eventually needing
to do it properly.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to understand all of this manual, nor will this post be a
guide to the manual. I will just explain what sections and diagrams I found
useful in understanding how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I only ever opened Volume 2, the instruction set reference. In that honking
2300 page volume are descriptions of every Intel x86-64 instruction and how
they are encoded. The instructions are listed alphabetically and split into
sections based on the first letter of each instruction name.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Chapter 3, specifically at the MOV instruction on page
&nbsp; 1209. For those following along who do not want to download a massive
PDF, this <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html">website</a> has a bunch
of the same data in HTML form. Here’s the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mov">page for
MOV</a>.</p>

<p>This page has every variant of MOV instruction. There are other instructions
begin with MOV, like MOVAPD, MOVAPS, etc, but they are different enough that
they are different instructions.</p>

<p>It has six columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Opcode</em>, which describes the layout of the bytes in the instruction stream.
This describes how we’ll encode instructions.</li>
  <li><em>Instruction</em>, which gives a text-assembly-esque representation of the
instruction. This is useful for figuring out which one we actually want to
encode.</li>
  <li><em>Op/En</em>, which stands for “Operand Encoding” and as far as I can tell
describes the operand order with a symbol that is explained further in the
“Instruction Operand Encoding” table on the following page.</li>
  <li><em>64-Bit Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in 64-bit mode
(“Valid”) or not (something else, I guess).</li>
  <li><em>Compat/Leg Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in some
other mode, which I imagine is 32-bit mode or 16-bit mode. I don’t know. But
it’s not relevant for us.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>, which provides a “plain English” description of the opcode,
for some definition of the words “plain” and “English”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other instructions have slightly different table layouts, so you’ll have to
work out what the other columns mean.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of some rows from the table, with HTML courtesy of Felix
Cloutier’s aforementioned web docs:</p>

<p>If you take a look at the last entry in the table, you’ll see <code>REX.W + C7 /0
id</code>. Does that look familiar? Maybe, if you squint a little?</p>

<p>It turns out, that’s the description for encoding the instruction we originally
wanted, and had a bad encoder for. Let’s try and figure out how to use this to
make our encoder better. In order to do that, we’ll need to first understand a
general layout for Intel instructions.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encoding-big-picture">Instruction encoding, big picture</h3>

<p>All Intel x86-64 instructions follow this general format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>optional</em> instruction prefix (1 byte)</li>
  <li>opcode (1, 2, or 3 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Mod-Reg/Opcode-R/M, also known as ModR/M (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Scale-Index-Base, also known as SIB (1 byte)</li>
  <li>displacement (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
  <li>immediate data (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this information at the very beginning of Volume 2, Chapter 2 (page
527) in a section called “Instruction format for protected mode, real-address
mode, and virtual-8086 mode”.</p>

<p>You, like me, may be wondering about the difference between “optional”, “if
required”, and “…, or none”. I have no explanation, sorry.</p>

<p>I’m going to briefly explain each component here, followed up with a
piece-by-piece dissection of the particular MOV instruction we want, so we get
some hands-on practice.</p>

<h4 id="instruction-prefixes">Instruction prefixes</h4>

<p>There are a couple kind of instruction prefixes, like REX (Section 2.2.1) and
VEX (Section 2.3). We’re going to focus on REX prefixes, since they are needed
for many (most?) x86-64 instructions, and we’re not emitting vector
instructions.</p>

<p>The REX prefixes are used to indicate that an instruction, which might normally
refer to a 32-bit register, should instead refer to a 64-bit register. Also
some other things but we’re mostly concerned with register sizes.</p>

<h4 id="opcode">Opcode</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.2 (page 529) for a brief explanation of opcodes. The
gist is that the opcode is the <em>meat</em> of the instruction. It’s what makes a MOV
a MOV and not a HALT. The other fields all modify the meaning given by this
field.</p>

<h4 id="modrm-and-sib">ModR/M and SIB</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.3 (page 529) for a brief explanation of ModR/M and
SIB bytes. The gist is that they encode what register sources and destinations
to use.</p>

<h4 id="displacement-and-immediates">Displacement and immediates</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.4 (page 529) for a brief explanation of displacement
and immediate bytes. The gist is that they encode literal numbers used in the
instructions that don’t encode registers or anything.</p>

<p>If you’re confused, that’s okay. It should maybe get clearer once we get our
hands dirty. Reading all of this information in a vacuum is moderately useless
if it’s your first time dealing with assembly like this, but I included this
section first to help explain how to use the reference.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-piece-by-piece">Encoding, piece by piece</h3>

<p>Got all that? Maybe? No? Yeah, me neither. But let’s forge ahead anyway. Here’s
the instruction we’re going to encode: <code>REX.W + C7 /0 id</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rexw">REX.W</h4>

<p>First, let’s figure out <code>REX.W</code>. According to Section 2.2.1, which explains REX
prefixes in some detail, there are a couple of different prefixes. There’s a
helpful table (Table 2-4, page 535) documenting them. Here’s a bit diagram with
the same information:</p>

<p>In English, and zero-indexed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bits 7-4 are always <code>0b0100</code>.</li>
  <li>Bit 3 is the W prefix. If it’s 1, it means the operands are 64 bits. If it’s
0, “operand size [is] determined by CS.D”. Not sure what that means.</li>
  <li>Bits 2, 1, and 0 are other types of REX prefixes that we may not end up
using, so I am omitting them here. Please read further in the manual if you
are curious!</li>
</ul>

<p>This MOV instruction calls for REX.W, which means this byte will look like
<code>0b01001000</code>, also known as our friend <code>0x48</code>. Mystery number one, solved!</p>

<h4 id="c7">C7</h4>

<p>This is a hexadecimal literal <code>0xc7</code>. It is the <em>opcode</em>. There are a couple of
other entries with the opcode <code>C7</code>, modified by other bytes in the instruction
(ModR/M, SIB, REX, …). Write it to the instruction stream. Mystery number
two, solved!</p>

<h4 id="0">/0</h4>

<p>There’s a snippet in Section 2.1.5 that explains this notation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the Reg/Opcode
field may be used as an opcode extension. This use is represented by the
sixth row in the tables (labeled “/digit (Opcode)”). Note that values in row
six are represented in decimal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little confusing because this operation clearly <em>does</em> have a second
operand, denoted by the “MI” in the table, which shows Operand 1 being
<code>ModRM:r/m (w)</code> and Operand 2 being <code>imm8/16/32/64</code>. I think it’s because it
doesn’t have a second <em>register</em> operand that this space is free — the
immediate is in a different place in the instruction.</p>

<p>In any case, this means that we have to make sure to put decimal <code>0</code> in the
<code>reg</code> part of the ModR/M byte. We’ll see what the ModR/M byte looks like in
greater detail shortly.</p>

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

<p><em>id</em> refers to an immediate <em>double word</em> (32 bits). It’s called a <em>double</em>
word because, a word (<em>iw</em>) is 16 bits. In increasing order of size, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ib</em>, byte (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>iw</em>, word (2 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>id</em>, double word (4 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>io</em>, quad word (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we have to write our 32-bit value out to the instruction stream.
These notations and encodings are explained further in Section 3.1.1.1 (page
596).</p>

<p>Overall, that means that this instruction will have the …</p></div></div>

<p>As software teams, we know how important it is to have the right tool for any given job. After all, we’re the people who actually <em>build</em> the tools used for all kinds of jobs.</p>



<p>And now, as more companies make digital transformations, there’s mounting pressure to build better apps, faster. Software teams are expected to get more and more agile, which requires teamwork from development and operations teams to increase their build velocity and deliver new, better solutions —&nbsp;faster than ever before.</p>



<p>You already know that’s where DevOps practices come in. Agile methodologies are the key to delivering the constantly increasing speed and quality that’s now expected. But what DevOps tool is right for the job? When software teams have so many choices, how do they know they’re using the best tool for the job?</p>



<p>Two of the biggest names in the game are Azure DevOps and GitHub, so let’s take a look at both, their similarities and differences, pros and cons, and see which one is actually the better tool for developers.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: What are the differences?</h2>



<p>When you get down to the bare basics of each of them, Azure DevOps and GitHub Projects are both project management tools for development teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Azure DevOps</strong> is a collection of services for teams to share their code, track their work, and deploy and ship software. Some of the products included in Azure DevOps are:</p>



<ul><li>Azure Boards</li><li>Azure Pipelines</li><li>Azure Repos</li><li>Azure Artifacts</li></ul>



<p>What sets Azure DevOps apart from the many tools available to developers and software teams is its extended features for supporting continuous delivery/integration (CI/CD). Azure DevOps comes with a pretty robust set of features, including:</p>



<ul><li>Agile tools, like kanban boards, backlogs, and scrum boards</li><li>Reporting via dashboards, widgets, and Power BI</li><li>Git, which is a free repository with unlimited private hosting and pull requests</li></ul>



<p>Azure DevOps has also long supported other Microsoft products, and offered cloud-specific development services like cloud build and cloud testing.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>GitHub </strong>is a massive, open-source code repository that has long been a favorite for sharing and collaboration among teams. It features some of the best source control management the internet has to offer, along with cloud-based code sharing and social networking among an expansive community of developers all over the world.</p>



<p>While Microsoft has spent the last few years making moves to make Azure DevOps more open-source friendly, GitHub has always been designed that way. Think of it like “social coding” —&nbsp;users can work together on projects, share projects for experimentation and specialization, and use the platform to share ideas and find new collaborators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GitHub’s list of features is also pretty stacked, including:</p>



<ul><li>Cod management in both private and public repositories</li><li>Code workflow via GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, code reviews, pull requests, and protected branches</li><li>Excellent security and compliance tools, from customizable security alerts and automated code scanning to audit logs and LDAP</li><li>A marketplace for finding integrations like build tools, issue trackers, and more</li></ul>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub are Microsoft products, and when Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, it went straight to work at adding integration features that would allow Azure DevOps users to use GitHub as well. Despite how seamlessly the two toolsets can integrate now, though, there are still users who prefer one or the other. To fully understand how to choose between Azure DevOps, GitHub, or both, you need to understand the pros and cons of each.</p>



<h2>Azure Devops vs GitHub: Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/azure-devops-vs-github-enterprise">reviews</a> from users, there are plenty of pros and cons to consider with both Azure DevOps and GitHub tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>Let’s start with Azure DevOps.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Complete, flexible, and powerful set of tools<br>– Huge ecosystem of extensions<br>– One-stop-shop for all tools teams need for agile methodology and DevOps<br>– Constantly improving<br>– Free for five or fewer users<br>– Supports open source</td><td>– Some users describe it as a “Jack of all trades, master of none”<br>– Expensive for large teams</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>GitHub Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>And now for GitHub’s pros and cons.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>GitHub Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Constant new features useful for developers<br>– Brings social aspects into programming<br>– Fast and easy version control<br>– Industry standard for open source projects<br>– Extremely affordable</td><td>– The UI is not as simple as some other tools, meaning there can be a learning curve to use</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As you can see, real users think both these tools have a lot of pros, and not too many cons. So which one is actually better? Let’s take a look at how they stack up in different areas.</p>



<h2>How Do Azure DevOps and GitHub Compare?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Choosing the right tool for your team means evaluating both Azure DevOps and GitHub in a number of important areas. Here’s how they stack up against one another.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Included Features</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to their features and capabilities, both Azure DevOps and GitHub are powerful, stacked toolsets. Both are comprehensive and feature-rich, allowing teams to share and track their projects and code, opening doors for collaboration across teams, and creating an environment for quickly building software with CI/CD in mind.</p>



<p>We’ve already discussed a lot of the features that make both Azure DevOps and GitHub stand out in a sea of tools developers can choose from, so we’ll just say this: These are both pretty comprehensive and formidable sets of tools for teams of all sizes that come with useful integrations, collaboration support, and other features that make them powerful and attractive to all software teams.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Ease of Use</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub should be reasonably simple for the average software team to learn and use. They both have attractive, elegant interfaces as well as simple integrations with tools that should already be familiar to many developers.</p>



<p>It all depends on your team, though, and for some types of development, there may be a learning curve involved with either Azure DevOps or GitHub. While neither tool is <em>difficult</em> to use, they’re also not perfectly intuitive. However, to help combat this, both tools offer tutorials and courses, like GitHub’s fun <a href="https://lab.github.com/">Learning Lab</a>.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Community Support</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to community support, GitHub almost has to come out on top just because of the way it was designed: As a social, collaborative platform. Simply because of that, GitHub has some of the best community support there is in this industry.</p>



<p>But Azure DevOps users aren’t on their own by any means. While Azure DevOps products don’t quite have the same social support, Microsoft does have Azure DevOps virtual assistants who are available to help customers with questions. And if you need more support, you can purchase an Azure Support Plan.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Release Rate</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub: 5/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Azure DevOps is a tool that’s been around (in many different iterations) for some time. Formerly known as Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System, Azure DevOps sees regular releases and feature additions as users’ needs shift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, GitHub has evolved over its lifespan. It started as an online, social code repository, and has since grown into the suite of tools it contains today. Still, GitHub sees multiple new releases each month, including essentials like security updates, and new features as needed.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Pricing</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>For many teams, the cost is a major consideration when it comes to choosing the tools you’ll use in the long-term. Both Azure DevOps and GitHub offer different pricing plans and models depending on what a team might need.</p>



<p>Azure DevOps has per-user licenses available for purchase, and also sells bundles of services or individual units of usage. The Basic Plan costs $6 per user per month, and gives your users access to Pipelines, Boards, Repos, and Artifacts. Adding Azure’s Test Plans service increases the price pretty significantly, up to $52 per user per month.</p>



<p>GitHub, on the other hand, is widely viewed to be a more affordable option. All public, open-source projects can be hosted for free, and private repository plans start at $7 per month for personal use, up to $21 per user per month for enterprise plans.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: API, Extensibility, and Third-Party Integrations</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub allow for interfacing with their platforms via API very seamlessly. They also both offer extensive marketplaces of third-party integrations, from your favorite chat tools like Slack and HipChat to CI/CD tools like Semaphore and Travis CI.</p>



<p>There is a wide range of outside tools that communicate well with Azure DevOps, including REST APIs, command-line tools, web-based tools, desktop client developers, and more.</p>



<p>And GitHub Apps and Actions is where users can find a similarly wide variety of tools and solutions that integrate seamlessly with GitHub.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Security</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub: 4/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>And finally, there’s the question of security — a pretty important consideration for most software teams. For this, we’ll turn to some security experts: UpGuard, which <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-are-security-ratings">creates objective, data-driven security ratings</a> for online companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UpGuard rates Microsoft’s Azure website at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=azure.microsoft.com">751 points out of 950</a>, which is a B rating.</p>



<p>GitHub is rated slightly higher at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=github.com">789 points out of 950</a>, which is also a B rating.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Which Tool Is Better?</h2>



<p>So which is better? They’re both powerful toolsets with different pros, cons, and value to add to your team. Because of that, we …</p></div></div>

<p>There’s never been a better time to be a data engineer, in large part due to the rapid innovation and rising popularity of modern warehouses and data processing tools. When working with customer data, though, collecting all of your relevant information in one place and making it usable around the organization is a non-trivial challenge.</p>



<p>Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) have tried to solve for data collection and activation, but unfortunately most of them make the problem worse by creating additional data silos and integration gaps. Data engineers often find themselves stuck in the middle, only partially leveraging the power of tools like Snowflake and DBT because other components of the stack don’t integrate with their larger data workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s time for a new approach in the way companies architect their customer data stacks and how CDPs fit into the toolset, and that’s exactly what we’re building at RudderStack. By putting developers, their preferred tools and modern architectures front and center, we’re helping data engineers and their companies discover powerful new opportunities in the way they connect these critical systems and put them to work across the organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to announce RudderStack Cloud the most efficient, affordable and sophisticated customer data product for developers.&nbsp;</p>











<h2>RudderStack Cloud: A New Approach to Your Customer Data Stack</h2>











<p>RudderStack Cloud makes it easy for data engineers to collect, validate, transform and route customer data to their warehouse, real-time streaming services, and the cloud applications used by teams across the company.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Modern Cloud</h3>







<p>From the time we opened our first repo, we’ve built our product on Kubernetes for the cloud-native world, focused on extreme scale and fault tolerance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With RudderStack Cloud, we’ve created the best of both worlds for developers. Open source foundations, privacy-first architecture and developer-focused tooling make it easy to integrate the product into your existing stack, while maintaining the ease of use that comes with cloud SaaS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Running on the modern cloud and not storing data allows us to be much more cost efficient, as reflected in our new pricing model (more at the end of the post). </p>







<h3>Data Warehouse Centric</h3>







<p>Scalability and functionality limited warehouses in the past, meaning valuable information like customer cohorts were trapped in 3rd-party tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The warehouse is the CDP of the future, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/datasets/tapad-the-tapad-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapad’s new integration</a> with Snowflake, which allows you to integrate warehouse data with rich, 3rd party data sources directly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new approach, RudderStack Cloud allows you to turn your warehouse into a CDP with features like configurable, near-real time sync, and SQL as a Source, which turns your warehouse into a RudderStack Source.</p>

<p>We’ve also built RudderStack Cloud to leverage the more advanced functionalities of modern data warehouses. </p>



<p>To that end, <strong>we’re excited to announce support for semi-structured data via VARIANT type in Snowflake as part of RudderStack Cloud.</strong> Many data engineers send JSON objects via RudderStack as VARIANT in Snowflake to make querying much easier (you can access the entire object as opposed to querying multiple tables).&nbsp;Learn more in the warehouse section below. </p>







<h3>Developer First</h3>







<p>We believe that the customer data stack should be owned by the engineering team, which is why our product is always developer-first and integrates with the tools they already use and love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Schema Monitoring feature is exposed through a REST API, making it easy to integrate with existing data governance workflows. We <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/administrators-guide/monitoring-and-metrics">expose metrics</a> that can be easily consumed by any statsd server and use Grafana to visualize infrastructure health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, we remain committed to the OSS community and our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">OSS product</a>, with core developers providing daily community support <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/xNEdEGw">on Discord</a>.</p>











<h2>Features in Rudderstack Cloud</h2>











<p><strong>Sources &amp; Destinations</strong> — RudderStack Cloud has <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides">11 SDKs</a> for collecting web, mobile and server-side event data. This release also includes sendBeacon support for our JavaScript SDK, which can improve speed by up to 30% (a huge win for speed-sensitive eCommerce use-cases).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also ingest data from <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/sources">cloud application sources</a> (like Customer.io and Salesforce) and BI tools (like Looker). You can route ingested data to more than <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations">60 destinations</a>, including real-time/streaming destinations like Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis, warehouses like Google BigQuery and Snowflake and ML tools like AWS Personalize (not to mention cloud tools like Amplitude, ZenDesk and AppsFlyer).&nbsp;</p>

With administrative and view-only access, you can limit who sees and interacts with your data infrastructure.RudderStack Cloud also features a sophisticated <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-enterprise/rudderstack-events-schema-api">Schema Tracking API</a> that you can leverage to QA and monitor the schema evolution of your event data.</p>







<p><strong>Open Source</strong> — RudderStack remains committed to the open source community by keeping the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">RudderStack Open Source</a> version up to date with RudderStack Cloud.</p>











<h2>Customer Case Study: Mattermost</h2>











<p>Data engineering teams at top companies have implemented RudderStack Cloud to handle their high-scale data infrastructure needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mattermost is an open-source messaging and collaboration platform built for high-trust environments. They handle massive volumes of data generated by their enterprise customers and have built their infrastructure on modern tooling, including Snowflake, DBT and RudderStack Cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, Alex and his team dealt with the challenge of having a copy of their customer data in a 3rd-party platform. Not only did they have security concerns, but MTU-based pricing and marked-up storage costs meant they could only afford to collect a small percentage of their user event data.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><div><p>With RudderStack Cloud, we’ve removed restrictions on event volume and can send all of the data we want to Snowflake.&nbsp; We can analyze and act on all of that important customer data and ultimately become a more data-driven business.</p><p>—Alex Dovenmuehle, Head of Data Engineering, Mattermost</p></div></blockquote>

<p>In the process of migrating to Snowflake, which decouples storage and compute, they re-evaluated their customer data infrastructure and wanted to take a similar approach: decoupling the data pipeline from storage and removing the 3rd party platform from the equation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RudderStack Cloud enabled Alex and the data engineering team to achieve ubiquitous data capture across devices and fully leverage Snowflake as their owned, central repository of customer data.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>L</span>ast December, Hollywood actor Armie Hammer arrived in Saudi Arabia for a music festival in Riyadh, the gulf kingdom’s capital. A day after the event, in a breathless Instagram post, he compared the festival to “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/influencers-are-calling-other-influencers-out-for-saudi">Woodstock</a> in the 1960’s,” his desert surroundings notwithstanding.</p>



<p>Joining him were a mix of A–C-list celebrities like model Sofia Richie and actor Ryan Phillippe, along with a large group of Western travel bloggers. They had been flown out and, in some instances, paid to attend the festival, called <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/23/instagram-influencers-partied-saudi-arabian-music-festival-no-one-mentioned-human-rights/">MDL Beast</a>. The event, put on by the country’s General Entertainment Authority, a body created by royal decree in 2016, is one of the flashiest examples of influencer marketing ever. In this case, the product they were meant to market was leisure travel to Saudi Arabia, a kingdom ruled by an Islamic monarchy.</p>



<p>The Instagram posts coming out of the festival looked more Coachella than Sharia. Model Jourdan Dunn smized in <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/jourdan-dunn-attends-the-mdl-beast-festival-on-december-19-news-photo/1194937352">boxer braids</a> in front of a neon backdrop; Hammer and Phillippe wore traditional checkered <a href="https://toofab.com/photos/2019/12/20/ryan-phillippe-and-armie-hammer-travel-to-saudi-arabia-for-mdl-beast-festival/">kaffiyeh</a> headscarves with their fleeces. “So grateful to be in a country I’ve never experienced before,” wrote Olivia Culpo. “I’ve changed my name to Habib Aoki,” wrote DJ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Qx0n1jfoz/?utm_source=ig_embed">Steve Aoki</a> (also unable to resist the kaffiyeh).</p>



<p>The timing of MDL Beast drew particular attention: It took place just over a year after the infamous government-perpetrated murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia is a hyperbolic example, because its budget is bigger, monarchy more absolute, internal politics more extreme, and reputation more notorious than most other nation-states. But in recent years, travel influencers, Instagrammers, YouTubers, and bloggers have chased clout in a number of countries with notably severe authoritarian regimes and egregious human rights records, including <a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2020/2/18/the-youtube-influencers-selling-assads-syria">Syria</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/louis-cole-vlogger-north-korea">North Korea</a>, Iran, Myanmar, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-persuaded-one-muslim-nation-to-keep-silent-on-xinjiang-camps-11576090976">China</a>. The content that influencers make in these places shows up directly on millions of individual feeds, giving it an air of authenticity, as if each influencer can reveal the “real” North Korea or Syria or Xinjiang in their posts, and it’s potentially more effective than traditional promotional channels like billboards or anodyne,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqwBHyzMzME"> alliterative</a><strong> </strong>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfxQy5A_tHs&amp;feature=emb_logo">visit our country</a>” TV spots. But while the coronavirus pandemic has briefly jammed up the travel industry’s perpetual motion machine, it’s unclear whether the travel influencer model will maintain its hold on the imaginations of an increasingly wary audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As<strong> </strong>for the Saudi festivalgoers, at least, the public outcry was swift.<br>How could these influencers, demanded their critics, accept a free trip from a repressive monarchy that jails and tortures activists, oppresses its religious minorities, and fuels the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811">worst humanitarian crisis in the world</a> in Yemen? The cognitive dissonance was just too extreme.</p>

<p><strong>Until recently, visiting</strong> Saudi Arabia outside of religious pilgrimages wasn’t very easy. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/travel/saudi-tourist-visa-questions.html">with its newly minted tourist visa program</a>,<strong> </strong>the influencer model has quickly gone mainstream inside the kingdom, according to Nelleke Van Zandvoort-Quispel. A Dutch-Australian businesswoman, she runs Gateway KSA, a tourism NGO <a href="https://www.gatewayksa.com/the-team">partnered with a former head of Saudi intelligence</a>. The NGO operates with a mission similar to <a href="https://vision2030.gov.sa/en">Vision 2030</a>, the ambitious economic modernization program of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “A lot of Saudi government entities are inviting influencers now,” said Zandvoort-Quispel, who is currently based in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zandvoort-Quispel said her initiative laid the groundwork for the swell in Saudi influencer content we see today. “We started doing influencer programs two years ago, simply because we wanted to garner some attention and market what we were doing,” she said. Gateway KSA’s bread and butter is small-group trips for students at universities like Harvard and Oxford, who come to learn more about subjects like the oil industry and geopolitics from experts inside the kingdom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But back when the programs began, Zandvoort-Quispel felt that tapping the influencer market might create a virtuous cycle and draw more attention to their programming in general. “We wanted travel influencers specifically, and not just random bloggers, and we wanted to expose them to new environments,” she said. The nearly two dozen influencers they invited over the last few years got to try their hand at<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Ekx97ho2o/"> falconry</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7YZlEIB_QX/"> camp in the desert</a>, become<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0TPct_BdDS/"> sword guys</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqjYindBzx_/"> ride camels</a>, dive, and more.</p>

<p>“A lot of time was taken up by ‘getting the shot’,” she admitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Influencer travel marketing works, for the most part, by providing all-expense-paid trips or stays for celebrities, bloggers, or social media stars with large followings, in exchange for posts about their experience. This direct channel has been a game changer for countries with PR problems: They can leverage the popularity of influencers to garner positive attention, rather than rehabbing their images through overt or heavy-handed propaganda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The influencer marketing industry is still on the rise and had been expected to grow by nearly $10 billion in 2020, according to a March report from <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2020/">Influencer Marketing Hub</a>. Travel influencers made up 5% of Instagram’s total sponsored posts in July 2019, according to analytics firm <a href="https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/instagram-influencer-engagement-hovers-near-all-time-lows-study-says/558331/">InfluencerDB</a>. The industry watchdog account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Wb9ONnOmV/?utm_source=ig_embed">Diet Prada</a> reported that MDL Beast influencers were paid “six-figure” sums to attend the festival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, several prominent influencers turned down the MDL Beast trip on ethical grounds, including American actress Emily Ratajkowski and American model Teddy Quinlivan. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6YuWYNppGE/">Quinlivan</a>, who is transgender, said on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/22/teddy-quinlivan-blasts-influencers-travelling-saudi-arabia-give-country-good-name-11949516/">her Instagram story</a>: “If you have any semblance of journalistic integrity, maybe it might be a cute idea not to take money from foreign governments that, um, I don’t know, openly kill and assassinate journalists [and] LGBTQ+ people. Suppress women’s rights, suppress religious rights – I mean the list of shit goes on.”</p>



<p>“Every traveler has an obligation to think about the ethical consequences of their trip. … But it is even more critical for influencers because they are such important role models, especially for young people,” said Dr. Ulrike Gretzel, who researches technology and social media marketing at the University of Southern California. “Uncritically spreading political propaganda is unethical under all circumstances and especially in the form of branded content, where the lines are very blurry, and the audience might therefore not recognize it as such.”</p>



<p>For the people running travel influencer accounts — many of whom earn their income through paid content and sponsored posts — the ethics of accepting sponsored trips can be just as blurry. While the Instagram posts and YouTube videos that emerge from their visits to less-traveled countries are not journalism, content creators nevertheless take on some functions of journalists, especially in an age where traditional foreign correspondence is vanishing. Their content is not unlike the gonzo journalism<strong> </strong>of outlets like <em>Vice</em> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W66ovZe1-TM">its early years </a>— which once did a lot of consequential journalism simply by going to hard-to-reach places — but without the expectation of fact checks or impartiality.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Uncritically spreading political propaganda is unethical under all circumstances and especially in the form of branded content.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Influencers also need to be aware that they will likely see a lot of Potemkin villages and will probably not have a lot of freedom during their trips,” said Gretzel. She added that they also must weigh the need to be “authentic toward their audience” against the desire to post something critical that could get them in hot water with a foreign government. “Many influencers are not trained professionals like journalists and might not know how to negotiate such difficult decisions and how to find ways to communicate controversial information,” she said.</p>



<p>In 2016, a British YouTuber named Louis Cole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqRUmazxBU&amp;feature=emb_logo">posted vlogs</a> about his (independently funded) trip to North Korea to his nearly 2 million subscribers and, predictably, received considerable critical backlash. Cole<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/louis-cole-vlogger-north-korea"> pleaded ignorance</a>: “I am not an investigative journalist. I don’t really do political commentary… I can only share with you guys what I experienced.” But, given that ordinary journalism from North Korea is <a href="https://www.cjr.org/first_person/north-korea-olympics.php">nearly impossible</a>, perhaps he and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/louis-cole-vlogger-north-korea">other travel influencers</a> who get a chance to visit have a moral imperative to present some critical information about a country that remains a black box to foreign media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>American travel blogger Matt Kepnes, who goes by the moniker “Nomadic Matt” on his website, said he has chosen not to engage in influencer marketing or sponsored content. Kepnes, who started his website in 2008, has one of the oldest and highest-trafficked blogs in the field and focuses on budget and long-term travel. He said North Korea crosses his personal “red line” for no-go tourist destinations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are not always their governments, so, for me, as long as money is not going toward a [repressive] government, that’s all right. But I won’t go to North Korea because all your money goes directly to the Kim regime, and it’s impossible to travel there without doing so,” Kepnes said. He adds Saudi and Chinese authorities to that list too. “But if I could go to Saudi Arabia or China on my own dime, that’s a different story.”</p>



<p>With any trip to a lesser-visited country, even a sponsored one, there’s the potential of finding unique insight about its people or society that can’t be seen from the outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Opening up to travel influencers is therefore, per se, not a bad thing because it can lead to more travel to a region and, with that, hopefully, more opportunities to expose injustice,” said Gretzel. “If the influencer has the freedom to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-*</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>) (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                   </span><span>when-true</span><span>))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-false (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-bool</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>church-true</code> would return the first argument (true), and our <code>church-false</code> would return the second one! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-true)</span>
<span>; =&gt; true</span>
<span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-false)</span>
<span>; =&gt; false</span></code></pre><p>Do they look familiar? …</p></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p>This post was originally part of my series on <span>Python for Feature Film</span> on <a href="http://www.dgovil.com/">my personal site</a>, but is being ported here with minor changes. The dates have been adjusted to match release dates for the projects.</p></section><p>Python is a programming language that has become integral to the movie making process over the last few years. There’s rarely an animated feature or visual effects film, if any, that hasn’t had Python play a large part in getting it to the screen</p><p>When people think about movies, even programmers often think about the artistry involved in bringing those images to life. However, the technical side of the film industry is something that often goes unnoticed outside a small group of people.</p><p>To that end, I’ve written a few blog posts about how I’ve used Python on several major films that I’ve been lucky enough to work on. Hopefully this shows how much it contributes to the entire life of a movie.</p><p>I’ve also recently released a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Udemy</a> to teach artists how to learn Python For Maya since it’s becoming an increasingly valuable skill in the industry. These blog posts serve as companion material to the course as well.</p><p>With that intro out of the way let’s continue…</p><section></section><hr><h2 id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h2><p>Some of you may not be familiar with Python.</p><p>Python is a programming language designed to be very easy to read and write. It’s incredibly popular in the feature film industry as well as other groups, like mathematics, science and machine learning.</p><p>You can learn more about Python on <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the official website</a>.</p><p>It’s important to note that today, the film industry is largely still tied to Python 2.7. There is a concerted effort in 2020 to move over to Python 3, and
we should start seeing larger Python 3 adoption starting in 2021 and moving forward.</p><hr><h2 id="the-feature-film-pipeline">The Feature Film Pipeline</h2><p>The biggest use of Python is in our feature film pipeline.</p><p>This is an image that describes the pipeline at most major studios.
The Pipeline is the arrows that link each department together. It’s responsible for making sure that data flows between each department and that everyone can play well together.
It’s also responsible for the toolsets in each department so that the artists themselves can work efficiently, but for now lets focus on the inter-department flow.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>An overview of the Film Production Pipeline</figcaption></div><p>Here you can see the various stages of a visual effects film or animated feature. Studios may differ slightly from this, but it’s the general workflow.</p><p>The storyboards/footage/previs represent the data we get, and Compositing/Lighting are the last stages of the film for us.
Visual Effects Films differ slightly from animated films because you have to deal with the extra added element of film footage in the form of plates.</p><div><figcaption>A more visual demonstration of this graph is in this video of the making of Ratatouille by Pixar</figcaption></div><p>The Pipeline is responsible for getting the data between departments. Here’s the gist of how it works (though it is more organic a process than the one described):</p><ul><li>We get data from the client or story artists in form of plates, previsualization (previs) or storyboards that tell us what is happening in the scene.</li><li>Modeling look at all of this and generate 3D models of all the assets that will be required.</li><li>Rigging take the modelled assets for characters and apply a virtual skeleton to make it animatable.</li><li>Matchmove are in charge of creating virtual cameras that match the ones used to shoot the film as well as any standin characters or geometry</li><li>Layout take the rigs, and either create their own cameras or take matchmoves cameras and set up the scene. They’re the equivalent of a virtual director of photography.</li><li>The scene is then handed off to Animation, who are the equivalent of the actors. They are in charge of the movement of the characters, and bring the inanimate skeletons to life.</li><li>CharacterFX are in charge of all the technical parts of animation. Muscle simulations, making cloth move realistically, the hair, grass etc… all comes from CharacterFX.</li><li>FX then handle the non animation related effects. Whether it be destruction, fire, voxelization, etc… there’s a lot that FX is in charge of.</li><li>While this is happening, Texturing are in charge of giving color to the 3D Assets so they aren’t just grey objects.</li><li>Shading then takes these textures and gives the assets a material that tells it how light should interact with it.</li><li>Matte Painting are the department we use when it is not logical or feasible to build an environment. We realistically can only build so much, and past that point it’s more efficient to have someone make a very high quality painting instead.</li><li>This all gets funnelled into Lighting who are in charge of adding lights to the shot and rendering the image out. They also do a little bit of compositing to sweeten the image. On an animated feature this may be the end of the show.</li><li>On a visual effects show, we have to prepare the plates by either removing unwanted elements, removing noise or removing the lens warp. This is handled by Plate Prep,also known as RotoPaint.</li><li>Finally everything goes to Compositing who take all the images and integrate our CG renders into the actual film plate. On a visual effects show, this will be the last stage.</li></ul><p>We use Python to tie all these bits together.
In the next section I’ll go over publishing before moving onto describing how Python is used for the individual departments.</p><h3 id="publishing-and-asset-management">Publishing and Asset Management</h3><p>This is pretty much the core of traditional pipeline, to make sure assets can be shared between departments and be tracked.</p><p>The first part of this is Asset Publishing.</p><p>When a department deems it’s work ready, it decides to publish it so the next department in the chain can consume it. For example modeling exports models, but does animation export animation? Well that depends on who is consuming it. This is dependent on whether it needs to be interactive past this point or not.</p><p>For geometry  we often just publish as a geometry cache using Alembic  which is a industry standard developed by Imageworks and ILM so that we can have a consistent cache format.
For point cloud data, we either use Alembic or OpenVDB, for images we tend to use tiff’s or OpenEXR.
Soon the industry will probably also standardize on a universal scene format from Pixar called OpenUSD.</p><p>Anyway  the idea is to generally keep the data in the most efficient format possible, while allowing for easy interchange. Cache data is often best because you really only take an IO hit, which is cheap, versus a deformation hit, which can be very expensive.</p><p>This all gets really complex though. Artists don’t need to know where their data is coming from or going to, or even how it gets there. They just need to be able to load it in and publish it out.</p><p>This is the pipeline. We develop the UI’s and the tools to do this in a very user friendly manner.</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://www.gfx.dev/e49c8aaf611022c8415419e9f49e3d71/pyblish.gif" alt="Pyblish is a similar but open soruce frontend that is featured here for reference"></p>
    <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml">Pyblish</a> is a tool by Marcus Ottosson that is similar to many publishing tools in studios</figcaption></div><p>To publish data, the user just has to open a publish UI that will validate their assets against some tests, and then send it off to the machine farms where the conversion to one of the open formats happens.</p><p>To ingest the published data, we similarly just have an asset browser that lets the artist pick which asset they want. Often they just see a thumbnail and description. The details are irrelevant to most artists.</p><p>Because these publishing and asset management systems need to be common to multiple apps, we develop them in Python and Qt (PyQt or PySide) , which allows us to reuse our code without recompiling for each application and makes it easy to rapidly add functionality where needed.</p><p>This is common to pretty much every department, so I figure it warrants its own section here rather than repeating for each.</p><hr><h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3><p>Modeling is the department in charge of creating the 3D source geometry used by every other department.
Often there are quite a few repetitive tasks involved in regards to placing or editing geometry, or even just managing the scene.</p><div>

      </picture>
    </span></p><figcaption>A wireframe of a 3D model. This is Blender's Susan mesh.</figcaption></div><p>This is where Python comes in handy. Most 3D packages have a Python API that lets you do program everything that you would do manually.</p><p>So instead of spending 10minutes creating a simple asset, you can script it up and then just click a button when you need it next time. That 10 minutes saved really adds up, and over the course of a project you may be saving hundreds of hours that could be better focused on building more complex assets that require artistic input.</p><p>For example, in  my course  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python For Maya</a> I go over creating a simple gear using Python as well as creating a simple UI so that you can specify how many teeth the gear has and how long they will be.</p><p>This can get more complex though with using Python to create custom deformers or interactive tools, like this demo from Hans Godard demonstrates.</p><div><figcaption>Hans Godard has made some really interesting Python based modeling utilities.</figcaption></div><hr><h3 id="rigging">Rigging</h3><p>Rigging’s job is to create a skeleton for the character geometry so that it can deform, just like a real human would.</p><p>Of course that’s an over simplification.
Rigging is also essentially creating the interface that animators use to bring these creatures to life, but they also have to make sure that any movement happens convincingly.
If an animator moves the arm, the rigger must make sure that the shoulders deform properly.</p><p>Python plays an integral role in Rigging. Here are just some of the uses:</p><ul><li>Creating automated builds of rigs. Rather than doing everything manually, rigs can be composed using code which makes them easy to reuse.</li><li>Developing custom deformers or nodes to perform operations not native to the application.</li><li>Develop supporting scripts for animators to switch between modes or controls etc..</li></ul><p>In  my course  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python For Maya</a> I go over creating a controller library.
Controllers are, as the name suggests, the objects animators use to control the rig. Instead of using the geometry directly, they use controls, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>As I dabbled in SEO and content marketing, I quickly ran into a problem: I had way more content ideas to write about than there was time for.</span></p> <p><span>An article about a not-too-complicated topic would take me 2 hours to write, plus research and editing. But some of these topics weren't all that interesting, and I didn't want to spend all my time writing. </span></p> <p><span>I needed a way to scale this.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Outsourcing </span></h3></p> <p><span>The first thought was to hire freelance writers. In this case, I could focus on finding topics and outlining them and have others flesh these out into complete articles. This is a common practice among content marketers. </span></p> <p><span>I hired three writers from different countries on Upwork to write about different topics. The cost came down to about $10 for a 700-word article. The turnaround was fast too. But the quality wasn't immediately publishable. I would still have to spend a lot of time editing the drafts myself, on top of the overhead of working with the writers.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, the hacker in me said, "that's it, I'm turning my attention to automation."</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Generating Content with </span> <strike>GPT-3</strike> <span> GPT-2</span></h3></p> <p><span>The first content automation approach was to use a generative language model given a prompt. </span> <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank"><span>OpenAI's GPT-3</span></a> <span> has been making waves with the huge model and cool demos, so it was a good place to start.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of writing, I didn't have access to GPT-3 (by the way, if anyone can hook me up that'd be great). Instead, I used </span> <a href="https://huggingface.co/gpt2" target="_blank"><span>Hugging Face</span></a> <span>'s implementation of GPT-2, which was similar but with fewer parameters. </span></p> <p><span>I would give it an article prompt, say the title or first sentence I had in mind, and GPT-2 would spit out a plausible-sounding paragraph. The output read like human writing, which was good. But it was too free-form and off-topic for my use case. Playing with the model parameters that I could tweak didn't help with this either.</span></p> <p><span>I needed more control over the output topics.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Trying Production Services</span></h3></p> <p><span>Then I thought, maybe there are more production-ready services I could use. Sure enough, I came across </span> <a href="https://contentyze.com/" target="_blank"><span>Contentyze</span></a> <span> on an </span> <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/175-przemek-chojecki-of-contentyze" target="_blank"><span>IndieHackers podcast</span></a> <span> episode and was excited to try it out. </span></p> <p><span>It promised a lot on the landing page. And it had an interface that was easy to use. But the outputs just weren't usable. It just seemed like a wrapper on top of the language models I already tried.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Paraphrasing a Paragraph </span></h3></p> <p><span>I thought of a different approach. What if I took existing content, automatically paraphrased it, and added my unique angle at the end?</span></p> <p><span>I could take the content that ranked on the first page of Google for my topic and repurpose it as a starting point for my draft. And to simplify the problem, I could start with paraphrasing one paragraph (or sentence) at a time. </span></p> <p><span>And if I could crack this, this would be immediately useful for content writers and college students alike.</span></p> <p><span>This direction seemed promising!</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></h3></p> <p><span>I skimmed the latest natural language processing (NLP) research for the task of automatic paraphrasing. The first paper that caught my attention was the </span> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08417" target="_blank"><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></a> <span> paper (2020) by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Microsoft Research, and Google.</span></p> <p><span>It worked like this: given an input sentence (the sentence to be paraphrased) and an exemplar sentence, the model would "generate syntax conforming sentences [conforming to the exemplar] while not compromising on relevance". They even </span> <a href="https://github.com/malllabiisc/SGCP" target="_blank"><span>included the code</span></a> <span> and a pre-trained model. </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/sgcp.png"></p>  <p><span>Big promise from a strong team. Let's give it a try!</span></p> <p><span>And...the output was disappointing. I took the pre-trained model and ran it on the test data they provided (that is, not even using my own content). The results were far from even correct sentences. Here's one example:</span></p> <p><em>Input Sentence: why do some people like cats more than dogs ? 
</em></p> <p><em>Exemplar Sentence: why do some people develop food allergies later in life ? </em></p> <p><em>Output Paraphrase: why do some people prefer dog puppies more than dogs in ?</em></p> <p><span>Fancy approach on paper, but this wouldn't fit my use case.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Word Embedding Attention Network (WEAN)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>The model would use word embeddings (vector representation) to capture the meanings of the words and generate words from decoding the embeddings. That sounded great in theory.</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/wean.png"></p>  <p><span>In practice though, the outputs still weren't good enough. Using their pre-trained model, the outputs resembled correct sentences, but only for very simple phrases. For more meaningful sentences, often the model would not paraphrase at all. That is, the output would look exactly the same as the input. That was a deal-breaker for this use case since I couldn't just plagiarize other people's content.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3></p> <p><span>This was my first foray into delegating my writing. Many approaches I took sounded great in theory, but the outputs just weren't good enough at the time of writing. Though directionally I still think this is promising, as the automated techniques get more sophisticated. </span></p> <p><span>To this end, there are a few more ideas I can try: </span></p> <p><li><span>Run the paraphrase model outputs through a grammar-checking API. At least then I would eliminate the grammatical errors.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Train models some more with my custom data, or tweak the model architecture to apply more constraints to the text generation.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Try GPT-3 when I get access to it.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Generate content from underlying structured data.</span></li></p> <p><span>Thanks for reading this much.</span></p>

<p>I recently heard someone express the misconception that <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/02/10/false-positives-and-false-negatives.html">looking for strengths</a>, instead of weaknesses, is lowering the bar. This type of reaction is extremely common, but it’s completely wrong.</p>

<p>Let’s start by understanding what lowering the bar looks like: a candidate who was not considered qualified for the position before is now accepted into the position. Because there are limited positions and limited time to interview, this could very well mean a less qualified candidate takes the position over a more qualified one. The problem is what I’ve left as implicit, namely what it means to be “qualified” for a position.</p>

<h2 id="redefining-the-bar">Redefining the bar</h2>

<p>Most importantly, you need to <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/06/22/hiring-for-the-role.html">define the requirements for the position</a>. These are non-negotiable skills necessary to succeed at the role. You would not hire a lawyer for a senior software engineer role just because they are a great lawyer. Their legal training is not, in this job, the primary strength you’re looking for. You still require the ability to deliver high-quality software.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for strengths still means candidates have to meet the requirements for the job.</strong></p>

<p>And yes, in some cases, the bar needs to be adjusted to favor technical skills less. For a junior software engineering role, maybe the combination of legal training and moderate technical skills is extremely valuable in a legal-tech company. This isn’t lowering the bar! <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/06/08/why-youre-probably-not-hiring-the-best.html">It’s re-evaluating what’s valuable to the company.</a></p>

<h2 id="determining-fit">Determining fit</h2>

<p>Suppose you now have a well-defined set of requirements for the position you’re hiring for. Great! But is your interview process actually selecting people who meet those requirements? Or is it selecting those who meet a different set of requirements?</p>

<p>If you need a senior engineer with the ability to deliver high-quality software, but you present them with dynamic programming problems, you’ll reject candidates who are qualified but can’t solve dynamic programming problems on a whiteboard under the pressure of a job interview. If you need a strong team player who can work with others, but you force them to solve every problem on the interview alone, you’ll reject great candidates that <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/03/16/were-in-it-together.html">work collaboratively</a>.</p>

<p>Compounding this is the antagonistic attitude so many interviewers take. By hazing the candidate, you’re rejecting candidates that work better in a supportive environment than you’ve set up in the interview.</p>

<p>Once you’ve identified the key requirements for the role, looking for strengths comes down to aligning the interview toward those requirements and ensuring those who meet the requirements can show it. The best way to do this is to start with the assumption the candidate is qualified, then give them all the tools they need to demonstrate that fact. <strong>If you hire a candidate because they successfully demonstrate their skills, you haven’t lowered the bar at all!</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Looking for strengths is not about lowering the bar. Instead, it’s about re-evaluating what the requirements are for the job you’re filling, and ensuring qualified candidates are able to demonstrate they can meet those requirements. This could involve redefining requirements to focus less on technical skills, but only because other, more relevant skills are needed. No matter what, looking for strengths will ensure a larger number of qualified candidates, all of who meet the bar, have a fair shot at the job.</p>

<p>My friend sent a picture to our group chat complaining about the subtitles on his video.</p>

<p>He assumed this was due to the OCR program used to generate the subtitles. Naturally he was confused how it managed to interpret <code>'s</code> as two random chinese glyphs. I was interested and asked him to extract the subtitles so that we could search for more occurences.</p>
<p>It turns out, there were plenty of places where <code>'s</code> was properly written in the subtitles, but 20 places where there were two random chinese glyphs. They were not all the same two glyphs. The resulting glyphs were always consistent with what the original text was.</p>

<p>I have no idea what could have caused this replacement. There are plenty of words in the subtitle file that have apostrophes without a problem. I thought it might be an encoding problem, since the replacement for l was one codepoint before m.</p>
<p>The offset between the character for <code>m</code> and <code>U+6A93</code> was <code>0x6a26</code>, same for <code>l</code> and its replacement. The offset for <code>s</code> was <code>0x6a27</code> which just confused me even more.</p>

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

<p>I came across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion">end-of-history illusion</a> the other day, and it hurt. </p>



<blockquote><div><p>The end-of-history illusion is a psychological illusion in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant personal growth and changes in tastes up to the present moment, but will not substantially grow or mature in the future.</p><p>[…] Overall the study concludes that at all ages individuals seem to believe that their pace of personal change has now slowed to a crawl, while evidence points to this being an underestimation.</p></div><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Owwwww! I have grown and changed <em>so much</em> in the past few years. It doesn’t seem possible to repeat that rate of growth in the next few years. What else is there to learn? How else could I possibly change? I’m an idiot, but hey, apparently so is everyone else.</p>



<p>One of the conclusions of the original study was that “not only do people underestimate how much they will change in the future, <strong>but in doing so jeopardize their optimal decision making</strong>.” That’s terrifying. </p>



<p>Growth is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">one of my 2 values</a> and a few weeks ago I realized that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/10/what-the-heck-do-i-even-want/">I should pursue growth rather than happiness</a>. Now I’m realizing why that took me so long: because I assumed I couldn’t continue to grow at the rate that I have.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Make mistakes of ambition, and not mistakes of sloth.</p><cite>Niccolò Machiavelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>My takeaway is there’s no speed limit on growth. There’s no point of diminishing returns. The more I look, the more I’ll find. </p>



<p>I can’t make decisions based on the assumption that growth will slow down. I can’t make mistakes of sloth. If I’m going to make mistakes, they better be mistakes of ambition.</p>

    <p>TL;DR: These are the 3 major steps we took to reduce our memory footprint (0.2Gb instead of 4Gb) and the time to generate the reports (2m instead of 15m):</p>

<ul>
  <li>streamed the data directly to disk with <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a>;</li>
  <li>switched the memory allocator to <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>; and</li>
  <li>selected only what we needed, while avoiding ActiveRecord when pulling large amounts of data from the database</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-setup">Our setup</h2>

<p>Our main app used to be a rather big Rails monolith (235 Models, 220 Controllers, …) that was running on Heroku for the last few years.</p>

<p>Recently, we moved towards developing all new stuff as a smaller (micro) services alongside this monolith.
But hosting these smaller applications on Heroku quickly became too expensive, so we began to slowly migrate them to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">AWS EKS (AWS Managed Kubernetes Service)</a>.</p>

<p>After a while only our monolith remained on Heroku, so we decided to move it too.</p>

<p>Since there are parts of our monolith that are not so majestic, we expected some problems. Our biggest concern was reporting and its memory usage.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-history">Reporting history</h2>

<p>Reporting was developed in the early days of BetterDoc. Everything started as a simple HTML table. When the need to export them to Excel arose, we added a simple button to download the CSV report. That turned out to be error prone, so we switched to generating <code>.xlsx</code> files instead using the <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx gem</a>. We also started to generate the reports in the background and upload them to our secure storage. Everything was working great until one day reports stopped coming.</p>

<p>We quickly realised that our Sidekiq jobs were lost. We were using Standard 2x dynos with 1GB of memory and it was not enough anymore to generate reports. We quickly scaled to Performance M dyno with 2.5GB of memory and everything was working again. Performance M dynos are 4 times more expensive than Standard 2x so we needed to fix our reports. We had other priorities so we just wrote a script that will auto scale worker dynos while reports are generated. This turned out to be good enough for the time being (we only needed bigger dyno for a few hours during the week), so we never came around to implement a real fix. 🥴</p>

<h2 id="migration-to-aws">Migration to AWS</h2>

<p>When we started the migration from Heroku it took almost 15 minutes to generate the biggest report. In this time the worker consumed more than 4GB of memory. We were scaling to Performance L dynos to make it work.</p>

<p>Pseudo code for the report was looking like this:</p>

  <span>end</span>

  <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="step-1-stream-to-excel">Step 1: Stream to Excel</h2>

<p>We were using <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Batches.html#method-i-find_each">find_each</a> so that <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects got initialized in batches instead of all at once. But <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> still built up the whole report in memory before writing it disk. To avoid this we switched to the <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> gem which streams the rows to disk instead of writting them all at once. Luckily for us, the authors of <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> were smart to keep the API very similar to <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> so the required changes were minimal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Xlsxtream</span><span>::</span><span>Workbook</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>wb</span><span>|</span>

        <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>valuse_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This change was enough to keep memory usage in a 2Gb - 2.5GB range and we were pretty confident that this should be enough to make it work on AWS. We migrated our monolith, tested everything on staging and everything worked fine. 👍</p>

<h2 id="step-2-reduce-memory-fragmentation">Step 2: Reduce memory fragmentation</h2>

<p>Soon after deploy to production we got a ticket reported that some reports were not being generated. Our Sidekiq workers were killed and restarted cause they were reaching memory limits. Generating the reports kept our workers busy for a longer period of time, so they were using a high number of threads. We were already aware of <a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/2018/04/25/taming-rails-memory-bloat/">ruby’s memory fragmentation issue</a> when using multiple theads, so we decided to try <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>. In a few hours we had jemalloc running in production and reports were succesfully generated with memory usage below 1.5GB. 💪</p>

<h2 id="step-3-optimize-the-data-retrival">Step 3: Optimize the data retrival</h2>

<p>While working on first 2 fixes we also spent some time thinking if we could replace ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is a feature rich ORM but it is not a good fit for pulling large amount of “raw” data from the database. We decided to try <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> instead.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> we were able to reuse existing decorators and make the switch as simple as possible.</p>

<p>In the previous ActiveRecord-based version we also were fetching a lot of columns - due to eager loading some associations (<code>Inquiry.reporting.includes(:appointments, :iterations)</code>)  - but only used a small subset of them for the actual report. As such we made sure to only load columns which were strictly needed for any given report.</p>

<p>With this the final (pseudo) code was now looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Reports::Inquiry</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Sequel</span><span>::</span><span>Model</span>

It helps you achieve all your goals as well as assists you when you procrastinate. If you know how to focus on the task at hand, you are more likely to achieve your goal, but sometimes you just can’t keep the focus and distract. In this article, you will find out how attention works and what causes it to alter.</p><p>But before going into the details, let’s talk about what attention is.</p><h2 id="a-small-window-into-the-vast-world">A Small Window Into The Vast World</h2><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-satellitte-dish-analogy.png" alt="Satellite dish"></p><p>Consider the satellite dish. The signal from every satellite TV channel propagates through the air at every moment. And the satellite dish receives every frequency, but it amplifies only the channel we set it to. Millions of hours of airtime beam through space each moment, but we only see and hear what the satellite dish is tuned to, what it is focused on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>So it is with our brains and attention. We are bombarded with sensory information at any given moment: lights, sounds, sights, smells, balance, and more, but we direct our attention only to certain stimuli: the screen we see in front of us or a song we are listening to. Our attention works like a filter - we focus on what we like and filter out what we don’t seek. Like a satellite dish, the brain receives a flood of signal, but it promotes to our awareness only what we are interested in.</p><h2 id="orienting-attention-from-within-and-without">Orienting Attention From Within And Without</h2><p>We can orient our attention toward what we want or need as we decide. We are in charge of our attention. We are masters of it… Until we are not.</p><p>Studies have shown, and, from your experience, you can easily recall numerous cases when you are focusing on something but get distracted by noises, sights, people, and other unrelated things. Therefore, even though we are in charge of our attention, there is a lot more happening in the background.</p><p>In 2002, Maurizio Corbetta and Gordon L. Shulman published a paper<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in which they addressed the evidence of the two types of attention: the one that can be deployed under voluntary control and the other that can be captured by unexpected or salient events.</p><h2 id="goal-directed-attention-top-down">Goal-Directed Attention (Top-Down)</h2><p>Goal-Directed attention (GDA) is the cognitive effort we make when we are curious about something or when we focus on something that is aligned with our goals. And by “goals” here, I don’t mean some grandiose, life-defining objectives. If I ask you to look at the blue circle in the image below, focusing your attention on it is also a goal you are pursuing.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/colored-circles.png" alt="Image with three circles of different colors"></p><p>Another example is that you read these words now by deliberate focus and process the meaning of the text you see. Or whenever you speak with someone, you focus on the words they say and the meaning they try to communicate.</p><p>One essential characteristic of Goal-Directed attention is the fact that it is very narrow.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/gda.png" alt="Image with Goal-Directed attention that is narrow"></p><p>Since we purposefully direct the Goal-Directed attention on incoming sensory information or internal thoughts, we need to process that information to know how it aligns with our goal. But the conscious processing capabilities of our brains are scarce. Our Working Memory, which is believed to be where we operate and manipulate with data, has an estimated capacity of <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">four chunks of information.</a></p><p>Moreover, we cannot consciously focus on more than one thing at a time, which further thins down the already narrow focus we are able to exercise.</p><p>In 1959, Neville Moray published a paper<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> that described the phenomenon later coined as ** “The Cocktail Party Problem."** Experiment attendants were presented with two auditory information streams — one in each ear, and they were asked to attend to information presented in either one or the other ear.</p><p>The results showed that the verbal content in the unattended ear is blocked below the level of conscious perception, meaning that almost none of the verbal content of the rejected message is consciously processed.</p><p>Visual attention is also narrow. Even if the visual sense has the highest information throughput, we can process only about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pixelated-perception/">10,000 bits/sec out of the 10,000,000,000 bits/sec</a> that hit our eyes every second.</p><p>To demonstrate this, let’s play a game. Do you know Waldo?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/waldo.png" alt="Image of Waldo"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://www.subpng.com/png-actfys/">subpng.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>It is a character from a series of children puzzle books. The books consist of detailed illustrations depicting some scenes with many people at a given location. And the goal is to find Waldo. Here is an example of a picture. Take a look at it to get a grasp of what’s in there.</p><p>Now, can you find Waldo in it?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/find-waldo.jpg" alt="Image where Waldo is hidden"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://pixy.org/1456168/">pixy.org</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>I hope you enjoyed searching for Waldo, but I’d like to discuss the <em>process</em> you followed.</p><p>First of all, you can tell at a glance what the picture above is about. It is some sparsely arranged marketplace with lots of people walking around. It feels almost effortless and natural — you glance over the image, and you form an impression of what is there.</p><p>However, everything changes the moment you start looking for Waldo. Then you begin to analyze the image meticulously, inch-by-inch. Some people go character by character, examining and comparing the character they see with Waldo’s stored representation in their Working Memory. Others might look frantically across the image, trying to spot some resembling patterns in characters (e.g., red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, etc.). Yet others might move horizontally or vertically, trying to find Waldo along their line of sight.</p><p>Regardless of the approach you choose, you will still have to look thoroughly through the whole image until you finally find Waldo (spoiler alert: he’s at one of the corners of the table located at the top-left of the image).</p><p>That’s our Goal-Directed attention in action. You had a <strong>goal</strong> — to find Waldo, and because you cannot process the entire image at once, you have to go piece-by-piece and analyze it in small chunks.</p><h2 id="stimulus-driven-attention-bottom-up">Stimulus-Driven Attention (Bottom-Up)</h2><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>As the name suggests, this attention is driven by stimuli. As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">How People Learn — Human Senses</a>, there are five sensory channels capable of receiving information (stimuli) of the following types:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Taste</li><li>Smell</li></ul><p>And there is an enormous difference between conscious and unconscious attention throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-types-throughputs.png" alt="Image with conscious and unconscious attention throughput"></p><p>Although we can consciously process only a tiny bit of information we receive from the world around us, all that unconscious attention throughput is there for a reason. It participates in the unconscious monitoring of the world around us and promoting certain things to our attention, <strong>overriding our Goal-Directed attention,</strong> if necessary.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/sda.png" alt="Image with Stimulus-Driven attention that processes information from around us"></p><p>And it makes total sense from an evolutionary perspective. Imagine some of our very, very far ancestors, on a sunny day, found a bush with some delicious berries. They didn’t eat for a long time, and while savoring the juicy berries, totally immersed in this process, a branch cracks somewhere in the nearby bushes.</p><p>The first reaction is the <em>fight or flight (or freeze) response</em> that happens in the first milliseconds after hearing the cracking branch. And it happens automatically, without thinking like:</p><blockquote><p>“Hmm… what could have caused that sound in the nearest bush? Could it be a saber-toothed tiger? Or maybe a bird? I think it would be more reasonable to get away from it as most probable it is some predator since my brother reported seeing a group of lions recently.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, some stimuli have the potential to override your Goad-Directed attention, even though you wouldn’t want that.</p><h3 id="the-drivers-of-stimulus-driven-attention">The Drivers Of Stimulus-Driven Attention</h3><p>But what exactly can override your attention? According to the father of American psychology, William James:</p><blockquote><p>In passive immediate sensorial attention, the stimulus is a sense-impression, either very intense, voluminous, or sudden — in which case it makes no difference what its nature may be, whether sight, sound, smell, blow, or inner pain — or else it is an instinctive stimulus, a perception which, by reason of its nature rather than its mere force, appeals to some one of our normal congenital impulses … these stimuli differ from one animal to another, and what most of them are in man: strange things, moving things, wild animals, bright things, pretty things, metallic things, blows, blood, etc.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Therefore, the Stimulus-Driven attention is captured by either high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.) or intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.) or by some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.), or somewhat “important” (e.g., one’s own name).</p><p>Similar conclusions were found in the Moray’s experiments:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>[…] Described the sort of reports that subjects could give about the rejected message. They could distinguish between speech, noise, and tones, recognize clicks and gross changes in pitch, such as the change from a man’s to a woman’s voice. But the verbal content of the message was blocked entirely, even to the extent of the subject being unable to say in what language the message was being spoken.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, more salient stimuli, like gross changes in pitch or different tones, are promoted to our conscious attention, but more weak or homogeneous ones, like different words spoken in the same voice, are not.</p><h2 id="the-yin-and-yang-of-attention">The Yin And Yang Of Attention</h2><p>Although the two types of attention have different and sometimes opposite characteristics, it is the interaction between them that allows us to exhibit coherent behavior and navigate the social and physical worlds we live in.</p><p>Goal-Directed attention allows us to perform cognitive-related tasks when we need to concentrate and process information (e.g., communicating, writing reports, coding, operating machines, etc.).</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention allows us to stay safe and navigate the …</p></div></div>

<p>This is the first part of a series to build a toy container system for fun.
In this segment, we’ll work on the initial setup to run arbitrary commands
on an Alpine Linux image.</p>

<p>Containers are not exactly trivial to implement from scratch. It takes a lot
of work to understand and use namespaces, and getting the semantics right is
even harder – so let’s do it! What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Snark aside, we’ll try to implement a toy container system in this article,
and see what we learn. However, the fact remains that the namespacing part
alone would probably take months to do, so what can we do? Well, it turns out
that at Arista Networks, we released a tool called <a href="https://github.com/aristanetworks/bst">bst</a>, which makes
that work significantly easier. It is still not completely trivial, but it
becomes possible to write a toy container system over a few days.</p>

<p>What do we want out of a container system? A few things come to mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need it to manage container images.</li>
  <li>We need it to manage per-user containers.</li>
  <li>We’d like it to be fast.</li>
  <li>We’d like it to be usable unprivileged (i.e. the user should not have to use <code>sudo</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>

<p>For this setup, we’ll be needing a few things. First and foremost, a Linux
system. Containers are mostly an abstraction over a root filesystem and
Linux namespaces. We won’t go into the specifics of namespaces here, but
if you’re curious, the manual page for <code>namespaces(7)</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> contains a nice
overview of the existing namespace types, with links to more detailed
explanations for each type.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the other tool we’ll need is <a href="https://github.com/aristanetworks/bst">bst</a>. Grab a
release and either build it from source or install the static binaries.</p>

<p>We’ll eventually be using BTRFS for our container image management. We don’t
really need any specific tool, but installing <code>btrfs-progs</code> is typically a
good idea. However, we won’t be using BTRFS in this first part – this will
happen in the next parts.</p>

<p>For our programming language, we’ll be using Go. You can pretty much pick
whatever language you fancy, but I’m choosing Go because it’s relatively
easy to read and understand unknown Go code, and it’s fast to build.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourselves why we’re using a third-party utility like
<code>bst</code> when we could technically just use Go to setup our namespaces. There
are a few reasons<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, but the short of it is that Go is good at a lot of
things, but not the particular use-case that led to <code>bst</code>. But that’s okay
– we can use Go to build the unprivileged part of our container system,
and it shines way better there.</p>



<p>Let’s take some time to understand what we can do with bst.  The first visible
side-effect seems to be that bst drops us in a root shell:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>id
</span><span>uid</span><span>=</span>1000<span>(</span>snaipe<span>)</span> <span>gid</span><span>=</span>1000<span>(</span>snaipe<span>)</span> <span>groups</span><span>=</span>1000<span>(</span>snaipe<span>)</span>,998<span>(</span>wheel<span>)</span>
<span>$ </span>bst
bst: not enough IDs allocated <span>for </span>snaipe <span>in</span> /etc/subuid <span>(</span>currently 1 allocated<span>)</span><span>.</span> Things may not work as expected, please allocate at least 65534 IDs <span>for </span>it.
bst: not enough IDs allocated <span>for </span>snaipe <span>in</span> /etc/subgid <span>(</span>currently 1 allocated<span>)</span><span>.</span> Things may not work as expected, please allocate at least 65534 IDs <span>for </span>it.
<span># id</span>
<span>uid</span><span>=</span>0<span>(</span>root<span>)</span> <span>gid</span><span>=</span>0<span>(</span>root<span>)</span> <span>groups</span><span>=</span>0<span>(</span>root<span>)</span>,65534<span>(</span>nobody<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is not the host root user – by virtue of user namespaces, this is our
user ID being mapped as the root user. To demonstrate:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>echo </span>Bonjour <span>&gt;</span> greeting
<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-l</span>
total 4
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 snaipe snaipe 8 18 oct.  09:49 greeting
<span>$ </span>bst <span>ls</span> <span>-l</span>
bst: not enough IDs allocated <span>for </span>snaipe <span>in</span> /etc/subuid <span>(</span>currently 1 allocated<span>)</span><span>.</span> Things may not work as expected, please allocate at least 65534 IDs <span>for </span>it.
bst: not enough IDs allocated <span>for </span>snaipe <span>in</span> /etc/subgid <span>(</span>currently 1 allocated<span>)</span><span>.</span> Things may not work as expected, please allocate at least 65534 IDs <span>for </span>it.
total 4
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 root root 8 18 oct.  09:49 greeting</code></pre></figure>

<p>You might have noticed the two blaring warnings about not having enough IDs to map.
This happens because our real UID and GID do not have any associated sub[ug]id.
Let’s allocate ourselves 100000 of them, and confirm that we have the right
IDs allocated:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$USER</span><span>:1000000:1100000"</span> | <span>sudo tee</span> <span>-a</span> /etc/sub<span>{</span>u,g<span>}</span><span>id</span>
<span>$ </span><span>grep</span> <span>$USER</span> <span>-H</span> /etc/sub<span>{</span>u,g<span>}</span><span>id</span>
/etc/subuid:snaipe:1000000:1100000
/etc/subgid:snaipe:1000000:1100000
<span>$ </span>bst <span>cat</span> /proc/self/uid_map
         0       1000          1
         1    1000000    1100000
<span>$ </span>bst <span>cat</span> /proc/self/gid_map
         0       1000          1
         1    1000000    1100000</code></pre></figure>

<p>We can indeed see that our current UID (1000) is mapped to UID 0, while UIDs
1000000 to 1100000 are mapped starting from UID 1. More information about
these mappings can be found in the manual page for <code>subuid(5)</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and related
pages<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Being the root user of a user namespace does give us full control over other
namespaces created under it. For instance, bst gives us our own mount namespace,
so we are able to mount certain things (but not everything) unprivileged.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>bst
<span># mount -t tmpfs tmp /tmp</span>
<span># ls -l /tmpfs</span>
total 0
<span># mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</span>
mount: /mnt: permission denied.</code></pre></figure>

<p>We couldn’t mount /dev/sda1 onto /mnt because doing so would have security
implications – if we could, a malicious user could mount and change the host
root filesystem.</p>

<p>You might now be thinking: “OK, that’s great and all, but all this gives me is
access to my own rootfs. Can’t we use something else?”</p>

<p>We can indeed! Let’s try to download an <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">Alpine Linux minirootfs</a>, and
extract it somewhere we can use:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>curl <span>-LO</span> http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/releases/x86_64/alpine-minirootfs-3.12.0-x86_64.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> alpine-minirootfs-3.12.0-x86_64.tar.gz <span>-C</span> rootfs
<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>rootfs
bin  dev  etc  home  lib  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var</code></pre></figure>

<p>Alpine Linux is a light, minimalist distribution that is fairly popular in the
Docker world, which makes it a great distribution to hack on.</p>

<p>Let’s try using our newfangled rootfs:</p>

<p>Uh oh. It turns out that we haven’t configured any network access whatsoever,
so we can’t install anything. Let’s exit the shell and pass some more flags to
bst:</p>

<p>This does a few things:</p>

<p>First, we add some very lazy networking support – actually bridging the
inner network namespace to the outside is non-trivial and out of scope for
this article. We do this by sharing the network namespace with the host,
and bind-mounting the host /etc/resolv.conf to the inner /etc/resolv.conf
to get DNS to work.</p>

<p>Second, we add default mounts for /proc, /dev, /tmp, and /run. A lot of
programs expect these mounts to be present, so we oblige.</p>

<p>With the new shell, sure enough:</p>

<p>Victory!</p>

<p>At this point, we should have a pretty good idea on how to use bst. It’s high
time we started to build the framework of our container system – our bst
command-line was starting to get pretty big and cumbersome to type.</p>

At RavSam, we also use Flutter for <a href="https://www.ravsam.in/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile app development</a> services.

There are tons of plugins available on <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a> build by the community that can be integrated right on the go with our Flutter apps. In this article, we will take a look at some of those plugins which can be used almost in any Flutter app and enhance the User Experience to a great extent.</p><figure><img width="100%" src="https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png" sizes="auto" alt="Share Widget in Flutter App" data-srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    " srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    "></figure><p>Share is a plugin that we can use to share the app content via other apps using the platform’s share dialog.

  <p><strong>This</strong> is the blog post that I’ve been excited to write.</p>

<p>I’ve been writing a series about the time tracking platform that I’ve been
building over the last two years. In the <a href="https://nathantornquist.com/blog/2020/10/time-tracking/">first post</a> I cover why I’ve been
building it, and in the <a href="https://nathantornquist.com/blog/2020/10/is-my-timer-running/">second post</a> you can learn about the specific UX
goals I had in the design. You may want to check those posts out if you’re
looking for some context on what I’m working on.</p>

<p>But <strong>this</strong> is the post I’ve been excited to write, and why I started writing
in the first place. iOS 14 widgets were an exciting announcement and unexpectedly
came in with giant answers to my design goals of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clearly indicate if <em>some</em> timer was running without opening the app</li>
  <li>Avoid notification badge noise</li>
</ol>

<p>I show the current time in <code>HH:MM:SS</code> format. When a timer is running everything
lights up green and the timer counts up by the second. It’s nice to hit the start
button, see the UI light up, and then see the timer start to roll.</p>



<p>To maintain reasonable performance I’m caching almost all of the data shown on
the home screen timer. All closed timers are cached with a final total and are binned
per category. I’m also storing a reference to the open timers.</p>

<p>This means the actual calculations to show current time are:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. Get seconds from start time of open timers to now
2. Add "open" seconds to cached values for total
3. Format totals as HH:MM:SS
4. Update display
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is run with a timer that fires every second. Because all values are
calculated based on start time minor slippage in the firing time won’t impact
any future values. Each update is unique, and shift isn’t a concern here.</p>

<p>My goal with an initial widget was just to take these totals and put them
on a small 2x2 widget on my phone. This would allow me to immediately see if
a timer was running and would give me a fast read of the current day’s usage.</p>

<p>It was pretty easy to mock up this in SwiftUI:</p>

<p><img src="https://nathantornquist.com/assets/2020/10/time-swift-ui.png"></p>

<p>Just like the core interface, my widgets support light and dark modes, and
indicate if something is running by turning green.</p>

<p>When building a widget for iOS, developers must provide a timeline of data. This is
essentially an array of values with dates. The data is what needs to be shown
to the user, and the date is when that data is relevant.</p>

<p>For a weather widget this is easy, and the number of timeline events needed
are relatively low. If you are displaying an hourly forecast, all you need is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1pm: 65 and sunny
2pm: 63 and sunny
3pm: 48 and cloudy
4pm: 35 and rainy
5pm: 28 and snowing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When extending to something like a fitness application it makes less sense to
schedule future data and instead show the current value and say how long it is
relevant for. This allows for data that is accurate within some range of time,
and the OS will schedule hard updates as needed. A hard update actually launches
the widget and runs your code.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that each hard update incurs a penalty as does each timeline
entry. <strong>The OS does not guarantee that something will be shown at a particular time.</strong>
Widgets that request constant updates will be penalized to balance other system
resources and needs.</p>

<p>In my first iteration of live updates, I displayed the current values and scheduled
an expiration time based on if a timer was running or not. Running timers had
scheduled updates every five minutes and stopped timers had background refreshes
every two hours.</p>

<p>This worked, but meant that my data was normally about 5-10 minutes stale. This
completely met the immediate UX needs, but wasn’t particularly nice especially
when the display directly showed <strong>second level precision</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Status: functioning, but with a mismatch in precision</strong></p>

<p>The clear phase 2 of this widget was to improve the update cycle. To see if it
would be possible to actually update the widget <strong>every second.</strong></p>

<h3 id="phase-2-updating-it-live">Phase 2: Updating it live</h3>

<hr>

<h4 id="first-try-swiftui-timer">First Try: SwiftUI Timer</h4>

<hr>

<p>As a first test, I wanted to see if I could just hook up a timer like I
would do within an app. With over a year since I had watched the WWDC videos on
<code>@State</code> and how SwiftUI worked, I thought a quick search of “how to use a timer
in SwiftUI” would be helpful. <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-a-timer-with-swiftui">It was</a>.</p>

<p>After a quick mockup, it was clear that timers do not fire in the background for
widgets. This makes complete sense, but killed the easy option.</p>

<p>SwiftUI Timer: <strong>Not viable</strong></p>

<hr>

<h4 id="second-try-lots-of-timeline-entries">Second Try: <strong>Lots</strong> of Timeline Entries</h4>

<hr>

<p>Switching over to a new option, I scheduled a timeline update for <strong>every</strong> second
and set the timeline refresh for hours in the future.</p>

<p>My goal was to test the accuracy of timeline event updates, and see how the system
penalized updates. It’s clear that full timeline updates (when the app actually
runs) are penalized, but Apple’s documentation is less clear on how/if a high
frequency of timeline entries are handled.</p>

<p>It looked <em>awful</em>.</p>

<p>The updates were close-ish to the second mark, but not nearly close enough to
display accurate time. Some gaps were clearly longer than others and it was
a much worse experience than just knowing that the data was slightly stale.</p>

<p>A timeline entry every second: <strong>Not viable</strong></p>

<hr>

<h4 id="third-try-show-uncertainty">Third Try: Show Uncertainty</h4>

<hr>

<p>The main problem with per-second precision is that you expect it to be accurate
to, well, the second. To balance this I considered showing the second when a timer
was stopped and showing <code>XX</code> when the timer was running.</p>

<p>I also considered showing precision just to the minute and scheduling an update
once a minute instead of once a second. An update to the minute is close enough
even with shift in the seconds.</p>

<p>These are two of the tests:</p>

<p><img src="https://nathantornquist.com/assets/2020/10/time-swift-ui-less-precision.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://nathantornquist.com/assets/2020/10/time-swift-ui-minutes.png"></p>

<p>The <code>HH:MM</code> variant is better. It is more accurate to what is known and true,
but it’s really not what I <em>want</em>. The <code>HH:MM:XX</code> is a hard no go. I really did
not like how this option looked either.</p>

<p>Show uncertainty: <strong>Viable, but ew</strong></p>

<hr>

<h4 id="fourth-try-textdatestyle">Fourth Try: Text.DateStyle</h4>

<hr>

<p>While looking for other options I came across the <code>init(_ date: Date, style: Text.DateStyle)</code>
API on a SwiftUI Text object.</p>

<p>This API is provided so that widgets can show dates, time since, time until,
differences between times and timers. This is essential to build a widget that
shows times until meetings, flights, etc. This is <strong>exactly</strong> what I was looking for.</p>

<p>I quickly found that <code>Text(pastDate, style: .timer)</code> would render <code>HH:MM:SS</code> timers
with the amount of time between that past date and now. This string automatically
updated and could potentially offer what I needed.</p>

<p>The catch here is that times are rendered as <code>9:15</code>, <code>10:13</code>, <code>1:53:52</code>, and
<code>32:13:35</code>. These strings show <code>HH:MM:SS</code> but do not add leading 0s. I’d have
to add the leading zeros myself in display.</p>

<p>A quick thought was to just have <code>00:00:00</code> as a text view under the live text
view. This would mean that as the time grew it would overlap the correct values
and fill them in. By matching the background color of the live time to the
background of the widget, I could cover up and hide the unneeded 0s in the
background view.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TextWrapper</span> <span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://nathantornquist.com/assets/2020/10/overlapping-time.png"></p>

<p>This was <strong>really good</strong>. A clean solution that would be easy to maintain and
straightforward to reason about.</p>

<p>Popping over to Xcode I tested this same view within a widget and saw:</p>



<p>Well <em>that’s</em> not right.</p>

<p>In that first image, I’ve set the background of the live view to a transparent
red. You can see that the alignment of the views is correct but <strong>the frame is
different when running in the context of a widget.</strong></p>

<p>It makes sense that the frame is different. To manage performance it’s safe to
assume that iOS is splitting the view into static layers and just updating a known
area. I assume that the frame is full width so that other content can be
pre-rendered in the correct locations without needing any computation for updates.</p>

<p>It’s bad though.</p>

<p>If the frame is full width then any background fill will be too big. Without any
other live content or updates I can’t manually calculate correct frames. This is
a big blocker.</p>

<p>I kept playing and found that all live updates stopped functioning when manually
trying to build custom formatting on the string contents of the text view. Live
updates <strong>persist</strong> through aggregate text fields, ie: <code>Text() + Text()</code>.</p>

<p>So I could do <code>Text(prefix) + Text(pastDate, style: .timer)</code> and end up with a
stable <code>00:0M:SS</code> for the first 10 minutes.</p>

<p>At 10 minutes even, this would result in <code>00:0MM:SS</code> (an extra zero in the minutes).</p>

<p>Adding a fixed prefix will break at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 min mark (‘00:0’ -&gt; ‘00:’)</li>
  <li>1 hour mark (‘00:’ -&gt; ‘0’)</li>
  <li>10 hour mark (‘0’ -&gt; ‘’)</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s possible to build widgets with live timestamps using <code>Text(:, style)</code></li>
  <li>Live timers do not start with leading 0s</li>
  <li>Custom formatting around live text fields breaks live updating</li>
  <li>Text views can be added together <strong>without</strong> breaking live updates</li>
  <li>The content of the prefix becomes invalid at 10 min, 1 hour and 10 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>This is everything that we need.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>My final solution involves looking at the daily and weekly totals and calculating
if the 10 min, 1 hour and 10 hour mark for each of those two counts lies in the
future. I then schedule the timeline updates with different prefixes for the
time value depending on how many leading zeros will be needed.</p>

<p>If you are at 6min for the week and start a new timer the weekly prefix becomes
invalid in 4 minutes and the daily prefix becomes invalid in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>On top of this, I’ve scheduled intentional complete timeline refreshes at the
start of each day (ex: midnight) to make sure that the widgets will zero out
properly.</p>

<p>Going back to the earlier question of “how close are timeline updates to their
scheduled time?” the answer is “close, but not perfect.”</p>

<p>When crossing the 10 minute mark there is a chance that the widget will display
incorrectly for a very …</p></article></div>

I’m a white, straight, cis-gendered male software engineer from Australia. I build products, fix bugs, and enjoy a good coffee.</p><p>And I say the word ‘guys’. A lot.</p><p>So when I was told that saying ‘hey guys’ might make some people (women, in this case) feel excluded, frankly, I didn’t understand. “I say ‘guys’ all the time. How could it be an issue?” I told myself. People telling me what I can and can’t say? That doesn’t feel right. For years, I held the view that inclusive language was a threat to free speech.</p><p>But all it took was one podcast episode to change my perspective on inclusive language.</p><h2 id="free-speech-vs-inclusive-language">Free speech vs inclusive language</h2><p>My late teens and early 20’s were influenced by the so-called Intellectual Dark Web - Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris and the like. For the most part, I respect them a lot and still listen to their content to this day.</p><p>Universally, this group is not in favor of “language policing”, to put it lightly. Famously, Jordan Peterson was outspoken in his opposition to Canada’s C-16 bill, which he believed to be a threat to free speech. Peterson was specifically against the idea that he would have to address people by their preferred gender pronoun (e.g. he, her, zir, etc.). In other words, he didn’t want the government forcing him to use inclusive language. Whether or not this&nbsp;<a href="https://torontoist.com/2016/12/are-jordan-petersons-claims-about-bill-c-16-correct/">was an accurate characterization of C-16</a> is another question. But the premise that one’s choice of words could be criminalized in such a way is one that I am not in favor of.</p><p>In the years following the C-16 controversy, the world appeared to split into two camps: one that was supportive of inclusive language, and one that, passionately, was not. I mostly found myself in the second camp.</p><p>That was until a few months ago when I was listening to an&nbsp;<a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/bartending-to-everyone-inclusive-language/">episode of the Front End Happy Hour podcast</a>&nbsp;about inclusive language. One of the hosts said something so simple, yet so incredibly insightful, that changed my mind in an instant:</p><p><em>“I question people who have asked me, “Why are we doing [inclusive language]? Like, aren’t there bigger issues to solve?”. Yes, there’s always a bigger issue to solve. But this one’s pretty easy. And it’s not that offensive.&nbsp;<strong>All you have to do is stop doing something.</strong>"</em></p><p>I am not easily offended. And so inclusive language as a concept was initially hard to comprehend. But the reality is this: it’s not up to me to tell someone what’s offensive and what’s not. All I can tell someone is what is offensive&nbsp;<em>to me.</em>&nbsp;Inclusive language is not language policing. It’s not telling someone what they can and can’t say. It’s not a violation of free speech. Inclusive language is about&nbsp;<strong><em>empathy</em>.</strong></p><h2 id="inclusive-language-in-the-remote-workplace">Inclusive language in the remote workplace</h2><p>What is often overlooked about Jordan Peterson’s views on the subject is that he is totally on board with using inclusive language in a private context. He just doesn’t want it to be legally enforced. This is an important distinction.</p><p>If you are talking to someone, and they are uncomfortable by the words you’re using, the resultant conversation is unsatisfactory. They walk away from the encounter at best annoyed, and at worst upset. If all it took to improve your relationship with this person was more inclusive language, wouldn’t it make sense to do that?</p><p>Whether you agree or not, you cannot escape the fact that <strong>inclusion is incredibly important in the workplace</strong>. Making your team feel included at work is better for everyone and everything, including your bottom line.</p><p>Inclusion becomes even harder to cultivate in a remote environment. When you’re working from home, you communicate with your team members primarily via text chat. Slack, email and Jira tickets. Text communication is notoriously hard, something that we all now appreciate in 2020. Your words can be interpreted in wildly different ways, to the point where a productive professional relationship can collapse in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Non-inclusive language generally seems to cause a more subtle, more gradual decay of workplace relationships. If I’m the only man in a team of women, and someone in our Slack channel addresses the group with ‘hey, ladies’, I’ll probably think, “Hmm, that’s odd. Doesn’t she realize I’m in this team?”. I’ll then go about my day as normal. But if this happens every day, maybe I would start to feel like I’m invisible. Like I’m not even a part of the team. Like My work is not impressive enough to be noticed. And so on.</p><p>And the worst part is, without the person reaching out to you directly, it’s impossible to know that you’ve upset someone until it’s too late. The value of their contributions declines. They stop proposing ideas in meetings. And then, they quit their job altogether.</p><p>Additionally, Slack channels are different from physical meeting rooms. You often don’t know who is actually in a given Slack channel. You might think the channel is only comprised of males and so saying ‘hey guys’ isn’t an issue. But what if you’re mistaken? Yet another challenge for inclusion in the remote workplace.</p><p><strong>The bottom line is this: inclusive language matters</strong>. When everyone on the team truly feels a part of the team, everybody wins. Conversations improve, productivity increases, and most importantly, people enjoy coming to work. And as more and more of our office communication moves to chat platforms like Slack, the importance of inclusive language has never been greater.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>And so, I’ve stopped saying ‘hey guys’ for these reasons. And a bunch of other words and phrases. Blacklist, whitelist, psycho, crazy, disabled, the list goes on. If there’s a chance someone will feel excluded by the words I’m about to type, then I’ll choose different words.</p><p>The question then becomes, “Well, how do I know what’s inclusive or not?”. You might argue that there are so many ways someone could be offended, that it’s not a practical problem to solve. I built a <a href="https://allybot.io/">Slack app</a> to help. AllyBot will suggest inclusive alternatives to over 400 non-inclusive phrases to team members. The suggestions are private to you, giving you the opportunity to edit your message at your discretion. AllyBot is <a href="https://allybot.io/#community">free for public Slack communities and educators</a> (reach out to me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tom@allybot.io">tom@allybot.io</a>).</p><p>If you’re still not convinced about inclusive language, that’s okay. Thanks for reading my ramblings regardless. But next time you’re chatting on Slack, I’d ask you to stop and think, “Is someone being excluded by my choice of language?”.</p></article><section id="articleNext"></section></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>If you’re a prior reader of the blog, you probably know that when I have the
opportunity to take a training class, I like to write a review of the course.
It’s often hard to find public feedback on trainings, which feels frustrating
when you’re spending thousands of dollars on that course.</p>

<p>Last week, I took the “<a href="http://infiltratecon.com/conference/training/reverse-engineering-with-ghidra.html">Reverse Engineering with
Ghidra</a>”
taught by <a href="https://twitter.com/0xjeremy">Jeremy Blackthorne (0xJeremy)</a> of the
<a href="https://www.bostoncybernetics.org/">Boston Cybernetics Institute</a>.  It was
ostensibly offered as part of the Infiltrate Conference, but 20202 being what it
is, there was no conference and it was just an online training.  Unfortunately
for me, it was being run on East Coast time and I’m on the West Coast, so I got
to enjoy some <em>early</em> mornings.</p>

<p>I won’t bury the lede here – on the whole, the course was a high-quality
experience taught by an instructor who is clearly both passionate and
experienced with technical instruction.  I would highly recommend this course if
you have little experience in reverse engineering and want to get bootstrapped
on performing reversing with Ghidra.  You absolutely do need to have some
understanding of how programs work – memory sections, control flow, how data
and code is represented in memory, etc., but you don’t need to have any
meaningful RE experience.  (At least, that’s my takeaway, see the course
syllabus for more details.)</p>

<p>I would say that about 75% of the total time was spent executing labs and the
other 25% was spent with lecture.  The lecture time, however, had very little
prepared material to read – most of it was live demonstration of the toolset,
which made for a great experience when he would answer questions by showing you
exactly how to get something done in Ghidra.</p>

<p>Like many information security courses, they provide a virtual machine image
with all of the software installed and configured.  Interestingly, they seem to
share this image across multiple courses, so the actual exercises are downloaded
by the student during the course.  They provide both VirtualBox and VMWare VMs,
but both are OVAs which should be importable into either virtualization
platform.  Because I always need to make things harder on myself, I actually
used QEMU/KVM virtualization for the course, and it worked just fine as well.</p>

<p>The coverage of Ghidra as a tool for reversing was excellent.  The majority of
the time was spent on manual analysis tasks with examples in a variety of
architectures.  I believe we saw X86, AMD64, MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC throughout
the course.  Most of the reversing tasks were a sort of “crack me” style
challenge, which was a fitting way to introduce the Ghidra toolkit.</p>

<p>We also spent some time on two separate aspects of Ghidra programming –
extending Ghidra with scripts, plugins, and tools, and headless analysis of
programs using the GhidraScript API.  Though Ghidra is a Java program, it has
both Java APIs and Jython bindings to those APIs, and all of the headless
analysis exercises were done in Python (Jython).</p>

<p>Jeremy did a great job of explaining the material and was very clear in his
teaching style.  He provided support for students who were having issues without
disrupting the flow for other students.  One interesting approach is encouraging
students to just keep going through the labs when they finish one, rather than
waiting for that lab to be introduced.  This ensures that nobody is sitting idle
waiting for the course to move forward, and provides students the opportunity to
learn and discover the tools on their own before the in-course coverage.</p>

<p>One key feature of Jeremy’s teaching approach is the extensive use of
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks for the lab exercises.  This
encourages students to produce a log of their work, as you can directly embed
shell commands and python scripts (along with their output) as well as Markdown
that can include images or other resources.  A sort of a hidden gem of his
approach was also an introduction to the
<a href="https://flameshot.js.org/#/">Flameshot</a> screenshot tool.  This tool lets you
add boxes, arrows, highlights, redactions, etc., to your screenshot directly in
an on-screen overlay.  I hadn’t seen it before, but I think it’ll be my goto
screenshot tool in the future.</p>

<p>Other tooling used for making this a remote course included a Zoom meeting for
the main lecture and a Discord channel for class discussion.  Exercises and
materials were shared via a Sharepoint server.  Zoom was
particularly nice because Jeremy recorded his end of the call and uploaded the
recordings to the Sharepoint server, so if you wanted to revisit anything, you
had both the lecture notes <em>and</em> video.  (This is important since so much of the
class was done as live demo instead of slides/text.)</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that it was clear that Jeremy adjusted the course
contents and pace to match the students goals and pace.  At the beginning, he
asked each student about their background and what they hoped to get out of the
course, and he would regularly ask us to privately message him with what
exercise we’re currently working on (the remote version of the instructor
walking around the room) to get a sense of the pace.  BCI clearly has more
exercises than can fit in the four day timing of the course, so Jeremy selected
the ones most relevant to student’s goals, but then provided <em>all</em> the materials
at the end of the course so we could go forth and learn more on our own time.
This was a really nice element to help get the most out of the course.</p>

<p>The combination of the live demo lecture style, lots of lab/hands-on exercises,
and customized content and pace really worked well for me.  I feel like I got a
lot out of the course and am at least somewhat comfortable using Ghidra now.
Overall, definitely a recommendation for those newer to reverse engineering or
looking to use Ghidra for the first time.</p>

<p>I also recently purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/3m3skjh">The Ghidra Book</a> so I
thought I’d make a quick comparison.  The Ghidra Book looks like good reference
material, but not a way to learn from first principles.  If you haven’t used
Ghidra at all, taking a course will be a much better way to get up to speed.</p>

<p>PIL stands for Python Image Library. In this article, we will look at its fork: Pillow. <a href="https://github.com/whatupdave/pil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PIL</a> has not been updated since 2011 and so the case for Pillow is obvious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The library provides support for various image formats including the popular JPEG and PNG formats. Another reason you would consider using Pillow is the fact that it is quite easy to use and very popular with Pythonistas. The package is a common tool in the arsenal of most data scientists who work with images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also provides various image processing methods as we will see in this piece. These techniques are very useful especially in augmenting training data for computer vision problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Here is what you can expect to learn:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>How to install it&nbsp;</li><li>Essential Pillow concepts</li><li>The Pillow Image Class</li><li>Reading and writing images with PIL/Pillow</li><li>Pillow image manipulation e.g cropping and rotating images</li><li>Image enhancement with Pillow e.g filters to improve image quality</li><li>Working with image sequences (GIFs) in PIL</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/best-image-processing-tools-used-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Image Processing Tools used in Machine Learning</a></p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s go!&nbsp;</p>





<h2>Notes on installation&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Pillow can be installed via pip.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>pip install Pillow
</pre>



<p>It is important to note that the Pillow and PIL packages can not coexist in the same environment. Therefore ensure that you <strong>do not have PIL installed as you install Pillow.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Now grab your pillow and let’s get started.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>Essential PIL image concepts</h2>



<p>We will start by understanding a couple of PIL image concepts that are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to see these concepts in action, let’s start by loading in this <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GvyyGV2uWns">image</a> using Pillow. The first step is to import the <code>Image</code> class from PIL. We will talk more about the <code>Image</code> class in the next part.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <div>
                    <p>We import the Image class from PIL not Pillow because Pillow is a PIL fork. Hence moving forward you should expect imports from PIL and not Pillow. </p>
            </div>
</div>




<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> Image
im = Image.open(<span>"peacock.png"</span>)</pre>



<p>With the image loaded, Let’s start talking about those image concepts.&nbsp;</p>





<h3><strong>Bands</strong></h3>



<p>Every image has one or more bands. Using Pillow we can store one or several bands in an image. For example, a colored image will usually have ‘R’, ‘G’, and ‘B’ bands for Red, Blue, and Green respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is how we can obtain the bands for the image we imported above.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im.getbands()
(<span>'R'</span>, <span>'G'</span>, <span>'B'</span>)
</pre>





<h3><strong>Modes</strong></h3>



<p>Mode refers to the type and depth of a pixel in an image. Some of the modes that are currently supported are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>L for black and white&nbsp;</li><li>RGB for true color&nbsp;</li><li>RGBA for true color with transparency mask&nbsp;</li><li>YCbCr for color video format</li></ul>



<p>Here is how we would obtain the mode for the image we loaded above:&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im.mode
<span>'RGB'</span>
</pre>





<h3><strong>Size&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We can also obtain the dimensions of an image via the image attribute.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <div>
                    <p>The image loaded above was quite large, so I reduced the size so that it might be easier to visualize in later parts of this article. </p>
            </div>
</div>




<pre>im.size
(<span>400</span>, <span>600</span>)
</pre>





<h3><strong>Coordinate system</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pillow</a> package uses the Cartesian pixel coordinate system. In later parts of this piece, we will use this concept, so it is paramount that you understand it. In this system:</p>



<ul><li>(0,0) is the upper left corner</li><li>coordinates are passed as a tuple in the form (x,y)</li><li>rectangles are represented as 4 tuples, the upper left corner is provided first.&nbsp;</li></ul>





<h2>Understanding the Image class</h2>



<p>As we have earlier we had to import the <code>Image</code> class from PIL before reading in our <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image</a>. This class contains functions that enable us to load image files as well as to create new images. Moving forward, the functions we will use have been imported as a result of importing <code>Image</code>, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;</p>





<h3><strong>Loading and saving images&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We have already seen that we can load in an image using <code>Image.open("peacock.jpg")</code> where <code>peacock.jpg</code> is the path to the location of the image.&nbsp;</p>





<h3><strong>Reading from a String</strong></h3>



<p>In order to demonstrate how to read in an image string using Pillow, we will start by converting the image to a string via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">base64</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>import</span> base64

<span>with</span> open(<span>"peacock.jpg"</span>, <span>"rb"</span>) <span>as</span> image:
    image_string = base64.b64encode(image.read())</pre>



<p>We can now decode the image string and load it as an image using the <code>Image</code> class from PIL.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>import</span> io

image = io.BytesIO(base64.b64decode(image_string))
Image.open(image)</pre>

<h3><strong>Convert to JPEG</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s now take an example of how we can convert an image to the JPEG format.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>PIL Save Image</strong></h3>



<p>Image conversion is achieved by reading in the image and saving it with the new format. Here is how we would convert the peacock PNG image to JPEG format.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im.save(<span>'peacock.jpg'</span>)</pre>





<h3><strong>Create JPEG thumbnails</strong></h3>



<p>In some cases, we would be interested in reducing the size of an image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, one can reduce the size of an image in order to obtain the image’s thumbnails. This can be accomplished by defining the size of the thumbnail and passing it to&nbsp;the <code>thumbnail</code> image function.</p>



<pre>size = <span>128</span>, <span>128</span>
im.thumbnail(size)
im.save(<span>'thumb.png'</span>)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27468" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-peacock-small" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-small.png?fit=85%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="85,128" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-peacock-small" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-small.png?fit=85%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-small.png?fit=85%2C128&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="85" height="128" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-small.png?resize=85%2C128&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil thumbnail" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h2>Image manipulation&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We have already seen that we can manipulate various aspects of an image such as size. Let’s dive in a little deeper and look at other aspects such as image rotation and color transformations – just to mention a couple.&nbsp;</p>





<h3><strong>Cropping images</strong></h3>



<p>In order to crop an image, we start by defining a box that dictates the area of the image that we would like to crop. Next, we pass that box to the `crop` function of the <code>Image</code> class.</p>



<pre>im = Image.open(<span>'peacock.jpg'</span>)
box = (<span>100</span>, <span>150</span>, <span>300</span>, <span>300</span>)
cropped_image = im.crop(box)
cropped_image
</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27471" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-peacock-cropped" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-cropped.png?fit=264%2C216&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="264,216" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-peacock-cropped" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-cropped.png?fit=264%2C216&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-cropped.png?fit=264%2C216&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="264" height="216" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-peacock-cropped.png?resize=264%2C216&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil cropped image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>Rotating images</strong></h3>



<p>Rotating an image is done via the <code>rotate</code> function of the <code>Image</code> class.</p>



<pre>rotated = im.rotate(<span>180</span>)
rotated</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27477" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-image-rotated" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?fit=403%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="403,426" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil image rotated" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?fit=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?fit=403%2C426&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?resize=404%2C427&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil image rotated" width="404" height="427" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?w=403&amp;ssl=1 403w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-rotated-1.png?resize=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1 284w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>Merging images</strong></h3>



<p>The package also allows us to merge two images. Let’s illustrate that by merging a logo into the peacock image. We start by importing it.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>logo = Image.open(<span>'logo.png'</span>)</pre>



<p>Let’s now define the position of the logo and merge the two images.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>position = (<span>38</span>, <span>469</span>)
im.paste(logo, position)
im.save(<span>'merged.jpg'</span>)</pre>



<p>This operation takes place in place of the original image. Therefore, if you want to keep the original image, you can make a copy of it.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>image_copy = image.copy()</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27480" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-merging-images" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?fit=408%2C424&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="408,424" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-merging-images" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?fit=289%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?fit=408%2C424&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="408" height="424" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?resize=408%2C424&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil merging images" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?w=408&amp;ssl=1 408w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images.png?resize=289%2C300&amp;ssl=1 289w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Now if you are using a PNG image you can take advantage of Pillow’s masking capability to get rid of the black background.</p>



<pre>im = Image.open(<span>"peacock.jpg"</span>)
image_copy = im.copy()
position = ((image_copy.width - logo.width), (image_copy.height - logo.height))
image_copy.paste(logo, position,logo)
image_copy</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27482" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-merging-images-2" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?fit=400%2C392&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-merging-images-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?fit=300%2C294&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?fit=400%2C392&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="400" height="392" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?resize=400%2C392&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil merging images " srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-merging-images-2.png?resize=300%2C294&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>Flip images</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s now look at how we can flip the above image. This is done using the “Flip” method. Some of the flip options are <code>FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM</code> and <code>FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT</code>.</p>



<pre>im.transpose(Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27485" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-transpose-image" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?fit=401%2C406&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="401,406" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-transpose-image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?fit=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?fit=401%2C406&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="401" height="406" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?resize=401%2C406&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil transpose image" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?w=401&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-transpose-image.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>PIL image to NumPy array</strong></h3>



<p>Pillow also allows us to convert an image to a NumPy array. After converting an image to NumPy array we can read it in using PIL.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
im_array = np.array(im)</pre>



<p>With the image converted we can now load it using Pillow. This is done using the <code>fromarray</code> function of Pillow’s Image class. Finally, we save and display the image using PIL <code>show</code> image function.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>img = Image.fromarray(im_array, <span>'RGB'</span>)
img.save(<span>'image.png'</span>)
img.show()</pre>





<h3><strong>Color transformations</strong></h3>



<p>We can switch an image from colored to black and white and vice versa. This is done via the convert function and passing the preferred color format.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im.convert(<span>'L'</span>)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27488" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-colors" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?fit=401%2C389&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="401,389" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-colors" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?fit=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?fit=401%2C389&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="401" height="389" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?resize=401%2C389&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil no colors" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?w=401&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-colors.png?resize=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Converting to colored can be done in a similar manner.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im.convert(<span>'RGBA'</span>)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27490" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-image-base" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?fit=405%2C406&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="405,406" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-image-base" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?fit=405%2C406&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="405" height="406" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?resize=405%2C406&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil colors back " srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-image-base.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>Drawing on images</strong></h3>



<p>We are about to wrap it up, before we do let’s look at a couple more items, including <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html?highlight=Color%20Transformations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">drawing</a> on the image. Pillow allows that to be done via the <code>ImageDraw</code> module, we, therefore, start by importing it.</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span>  ImageDraw</pre>



<p>we will start by defining a blank colored image of size 400 by 400. We then use <code>ImageDraw</code> to draw the image.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>image = Image.new(<span>'RGB'</span>, (<span>400</span>, <span>400</span>))
img_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)</pre>



<p>Now we can use the <code>ImageDraw</code> object to draw a rectangle on the image. We fill it with the white color and give a red outline. Using the same object we can write some text on the image as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>img_draw.rectangle((<span>100</span>, <span>30</span>, <span>300</span>, <span>200</span>), outline=<span>'red'</span>, fill=<span>'white'</span>)

<h2>Image enhancement</h2>



<p>Pillow also comes with functions that enable us to perform image <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageEnhance.html?highlight=Image%20Enhancement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enhancement</a>. This is a process that improves the original quality of an image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We start by importing the module that ships those functionalities.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> ImageEnhance</pre>



<p>For example, we can adjust the image sharpness:</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> ImageEnhance
enhancer = ImageEnhance.Sharpness(im)
enhancer.enhance(<span>10.0</span>)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27497" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-sharpness" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?fit=403%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="403,426" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-sharpness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?fit=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?fit=403%2C426&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="403" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?resize=403%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil sharpness" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?w=403&amp;ssl=1 403w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-sharpness.png?resize=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1 284w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Let’s take another example where we double the brightness of the image.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(im)
enhancer.enhance(<span>2</span>)</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27499" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-brightness" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?fit=404%2C414&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="404,414" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-brightness" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?fit=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?fit=404%2C414&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="404" height="414" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?resize=404%2C414&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil brightness" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?w=404&amp;ssl=1 404w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-brightness.png?resize=293%2C300&amp;ssl=1 293w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>Filters</strong></h3>



<p>Another super cool thing we can do with Pillow is to add <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageFilter.html?highlight=Filters#filters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filters</a> to images. The first step is to import the <code>ImageFilter</code> module.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> ImageFilter</pre>



<p>For instance, we can blur the image like so:</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> ImageFilter
im = Image.open(<span>"peacock.jpg"</span>)

im.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
</pre>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27501" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/pil-image-tutorial-for-machine-learning/pil-blur" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?fit=396%2C401&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="396,401" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pil-blur" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?fit=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?fit=396%2C401&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="396" height="401" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?resize=396%2C401&amp;ssl=1" alt="pil blur image" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?w=396&amp;ssl=1 396w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/pil-blur.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<h2>Working with images sequences (GIFs) in PIL</h2>



<p>We can also load image sequences such as GIF images. Let’s start by importing the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageSequence.html?highlight=image%20sequence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image sequence</a> module.&nbsp;</p>



<pre><span>from</span> PIL <span>import</span> ImageSequence</pre>



<p>Next, we will load in a GIF and save the first two frames as a PNG file. We break out of the loop because the frames are too many.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>im = Image.open(<span>"embeddings.GIF"</span>)

frame_num = <span>1</span>
<span>for</span> frame <span>in</span> …</pre></article></div></div>

		<div>
		
<p>Today, exactly three years ago, I received flowers, money and a <strong>gold medal</strong> at a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/10/20/my-night-at-the-museum/" data-type="post" data-id="10523">grand prize ceremony</a> that will forever live on in my mind and memory. I was awarded the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polhem_Prize">Polhem Prize</a> for my decades of work on curl. The prize itself was handed over to me by no one else than the Swedish king himself. One of the absolute top honors I can imagine in my little home country.</p>



<p>In some aspects, my life is divided into the life before this event and the life after. The prize has even made little me being presented on a poster in the Technical Museum in Stockholm. The medal itself still sits on my work desk and if I just stop starring at my monitors for a moment and glance a little over to the left – I can see it. I think the prize made my surroundings, my family and friends get a slightly different view and realization of what I actually do all these hours in front of my screens.</p>



<p>In the tree years since I received the prize, we’ve increased the total number of contributors and authors in curl by 50%. We’ve done over 3,700 commits and 25 releases since then. Upwards and onward.</p>



<p>Life moved on. It was not “peak curl”. There was no “prize curse” that left us unable to keep up the pace and development. It was possibly a “peak life moment” there for me personally. As an open source maintainer, I can’t imagine many bigger honors or awards to come my way ever again, but I’m not complaining. I got the prize and I still smile when I think about it.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A question <a href="https://twitter.com/skdh">Sabine Hossenfelder</a> asked on
Twitter prompted this essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you had a ten million lines, decades-in-the-making fortran code,
how’d you convert it to a modern language, how long would it take, and
how much would it cost?
<a href="https://twitter.com/skdh/status/1316570664103563265">↪</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no short or easy answers to this question. Inevitably, it
depends on a lot of factors:</p>

<p>We need a perfectly clear understanding of what the program is, what
it’s used for, and by whom.</p>

<p>We need to know what we’re trying to achieve by changing it. If this
is not a clear and significant benefit, and not clearly articulated
and shared by the project team and sponsors, the project will flounder
and ultimately fail.</p>

<p>We need to know if the program still works after we’ve changed it.
This sounds basic, but is a surprisingly complex topic, especially for
large, old systems.</p>

<p>And finally we need to understand the organisational politics that
will govern our project.</p>

<p>Let’s try to unpack some of these questions.</p>

<h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>
<p>What is this thing even? 10 millions lines of code is a lot.</p>

<p>Some systems are figuratively speaking responsible for everything from
the moon landing to the cafeteria menu, an “everything but the kitchen
sink” system. This is especially common in older systems, conceived at
a time when the overhead of building and integrating new systems made
just adding an extra feature to an existing system a very tantalising
proposition, even when (modern) software architecture principles
suggest it should be separate.</p>

<blockquote>

the moon landing to the cafeteria menu, an “everything but the kitchen
sink” system
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These systems are comparatively easy to reengineer, as we can often
peel off these features in an iterative manner. Indeed, this will
often have happened: We may find that the cafeteria menu module was
last used in 2002 when that particular usage was migrated to another,
new system.</p>

<p>At the other end of this scale, we find the single, contained model,
responsible for converting a tightly bounded set of inputs into a
similarly tightly bounded set of outputs. It is easier to reason about
a system like this, but the stakes are higher: This system likely
exists because what it does is very important to someone powerful.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-or-the-big-20-rewrite">Conversion? Or The Big 2.0 Rewrite</h3>
<p>Why is it important to convert this program? Fortran works fine, so
why not keep it in Fortran? Presumably, there are changes that need to
be made, and it’s easier to find programmers in more modern languages.
However, the hardest part of programming isn’t the language, it’s what
we’re trying to do with it. Next to the challenge of understanding
what those millions of lines are doing, learning Fortran will be a
rounding error.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could imagine that one of the reasons it’s difficult to make
changes to the existing codebase is that it’s poorly structured.
Getting the structure just right is difficult for the best
programmers, and especially under the pressure of deadlines and other
constraints, shortcuts are often taken. These shortcuts are known as
tech debt, which optimistically suggests the intention to pay it down
in the future. In reality, this is often neglected. These decisions
compound over the years, and in our case, the problem is quite likely
to be exacerbated by the code being written by people who are academic
domain specialists, not expert software engineers. Computers have a
nasty habit of not caring how well engineered software is, only
whether it runs, so “works” trumps “good”.</p>

<blockquote>

neglected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This mess, much more than the language, is why making changes to the
codebase is so difficult. But untangling it will complicate any
rewriting effort to an even larger degree.</p>

<h3 id="things-you-should-never-do">Things you should never do</h3>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn’t take the opportunity to link one of the
seminal software engineering blogs here: <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Joel on Software: Things You
Should Never
Do</a>.
Spoiler alert: Exactly this.</p>

<p>What we can do, however, is to progressively develop the program in a
certain direction that allows us to achieve some of the same outcomes.
A favourite text on this process is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Signature/dp/0321503627/">Growing Object-Oriented Software,
Guided by
Tests</a>.
Your Fortran program probably isn’t object oriented, but many of the
principles still apply. The idea is to identify and carve out
independent pieces of code, iteratively change and improve the code,
continuously adding smaller and smaller tests as we work through it.
This requires a “ground truth”, which we will return to.</p>

<p>The reason we want to do this, as opposed to starting from a blank
slate, is to enjoy the disciplining constraint of running our code
against a realistic workload (ideally production, depending on the
exact situation) as soon as possible after writing it. Plenty of
issues big and small don’t become apparent until this happens, so
modern software engineering preaches this practice with rather some
zealotry.</p>

<h3 id="ground-truth-what-does-good-look-like">Ground truth: What does good look like?</h3>
<p>In order to test, we need to know what correct looks like across a
wide range of inputs. Assuming the code isn’t well documented and
tested, the fall back plan is to have a substantial corpus of inputs
which we can run through the existing program to provide expected
results for an end-to-end test suite.</p>

<p>For each segment of the program we want to work on, we run the suite,
recording what goes into the segment and what comes out: This is now
our test suite for the segment, and we can set to work on it in
isolation.</p>

<p>However, this only works if we can be sure the test suite is fully
representative across the full input domain. Depending on the program,
this can be a very difficult exercise. It seems likely that a very
large part of this code was written to deal with various
idiosyncrasies in the input data – of these, few will be easy to
understand: They will have unstated assumptions, and if we don’t have
input data exhibiting these idiosyncrasies, there are some deep rabbit
holes to crawl down here, trying to understand what’s going on, or if
its even needed anymore.  Remember, if we just blindly copy the
existing logic, we will just be carrying over the complexity, not
achieving the (presumed) goal of the project.</p>

<blockquote>

understand: They will have unstated assumptions, there are some deep
rabbit holes to crawl down here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-vetocracy">The Vetocracy</h3>
<p>Last, but in many ways the most important issue: Assuming we get all
our technical ducks in a row, who will we need to convince to actually
undertake the project? One of the biggest and most underrated
challenges of large software projects in non-software organisations is
to get all the stakeholders aligned . For more sprawling systems, it
can be difficult to even identify these, much less convince them of
the value of the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming we get all our technical ducks in a row, who will we need to
convince? One of the most underrated challenges of large software
projects is to get all the stakeholders aligned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s easy enough to argue the benefits of a reengineered system, it’s
even comparatively easy to secure a budget for the project. What’s
almost impossible is to get through the vetocracy.</p>

<p>Our rewritten program almost certainly won’t produce the exact same
results, especially if it deals with numerical computation. There will
be minor variations on how floating point numbers are rounded or
truncated and how certain data types are represented. The idiomatic
way to do some things in the target language will be slightly
different from the Fortran way, with results being slightly off in
some decimal, or presented in a slightly different way. How many
people will we need to convince that this is actually OK?</p>

<p>Inevitably, we will find errors in the Fortran code and want to fix
them. Someone somewhere more powerful than us got their current job on
the basis of a report that (may have) included an incorrect figure due
to the error we found. They will be obliged to go back and report
this, but not before they sucked all the oxygen out of our team for
three months exhausting all possible theoretical reasons that the
error we found is not, in fact, an error.</p>

<p>That cafeteria menu subsystem? Because it hasn’t been used for 20
years, nobody knows who owns it. Signing off on its removal is a risk,
punting on the decision isn’t, so expect this decision to get punted.</p>

<p>And this is all before the lawyers get involved.</p>

<p>One of the reasons so many of the large and important organisations
running big, old systems don’t set out to do something like this, or
fail miserably if they try, is that they underestimate this dynamic.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Doing this is literally possible, but just barely. In this essay, I’ve
set out some of the minimal groundwork required to even contemplate
such a project: We need clarity on what this program does, why we want
to change it, whether we can provide a compelling argument for the
correctness of our changes and whether the bureaucratic context even
allows us to.</p>

<p>Good luck, you will need it.</p>

In a nutshell, it is the theorem that states that</p><blockquote><p>$e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$</p></blockquote><p>where:</p><ul><li>$x$ is a <strong>real number</strong>.</li><li>$e$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>base of the natural logarithm</strong></a>.</li><li>$i$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>imaginary unit</strong></a> (i.e., square root of $-1$).</li></ul><div><p>Note</p><p>In this formula, the right-hand side is sometimes abbreviated as $\operatorname{cis}{x}$, though the left-hand expression $e^{ix}$ is usually preferred over the $\operatorname{cis}$ notation.</p></div><p>Euler’s formula establishes the fundamental relationship between <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/#Trigonometric_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>trigonometric functions</strong></a> and <strong>exponential functions</strong>. Geometrically, it can be thought of as a way of bridging two representations of the same unit complex number in the complex plane.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the <strong>key values</strong> of Euler’s formula, and see how they correspond to points in the trigonometric/unit circle:</p><ul><li>For $x=0$, we have $e^{0} = \cos 0+ i \sin 0$, which gives $1 = 1$. So far so good: we know that an angle of $0$ on the trigonometric circle is $1$ on the real axis, and this is what we get here.</li><li>For $x=1$, we have $e^{i}=\cos 1 + i \sin 1$. This result suggests that $e^i$ is precisely the point on the unit circle whose angle is <strong>1 radian</strong>.</li><li>For $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = i$. This result is useful in some calculations related to physics.</li><li>For $x = \pi$, we have $e^{i\pi} = \cos \pi + i \sin \pi $, which means that $e^{i\pi} = -1$. This result is equivalent to the famous <a href="#Euler%E2%80%99s_Identity"><strong>Euler’s identity</strong></a>.</li><li>For $x = 2\pi$, we have $e^{i (2\pi)} = \cos 2\pi + i \sin 2\pi$, which means that $e^{i (2\pi)} = 1$, same as with $x = 0$.</li></ul><p>A key to understanding Euler’s formula lies in rewriting the formula as follows: \[ (e^i)^x = \sin x + i \cos x \] where:</p><ul><li>The right-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>unit complex number</strong> with angle $x$.</li><li>The left-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>1-radian unit complex number</strong> raised to $x$.</li></ul><p>And since raising a unit complex number to a power can be thought of as <strong>repeated multiplications</strong> (i.e., adding up angles in this case), Euler’s formula can be construed as two different ways of running around the unit circle to arrive at the same point.</p><h2><span id="Derivations"></span>Derivations<span></span></h2><p>Euler’s formula can be established in at least three ways. The first derivation is based on <strong>power series</strong>, where the exponential, sine and cosine functions are expanded as power series to conclude that the formula indeed holds.</p><p>The second derivation of Euler’s formula is based on <strong>calculus</strong>, in which both sides of the equation are treated as functions and differentiated accordingly. This then leads to the identification of a common property — one which can be exploited to show that both functions are indeed equal.</p><p>Yet another derivation of Euler’s formula involves the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Complex_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>polar coordinates</strong></a> in the complex plane, through which the values of $r$ and $\theta$ are subsequently found. In fact, you might be able to guess what these values are — just by looking at the formula itself!</p><h3><span id="Derivation_1_Power_Series"></span>Derivation 1: Power Series<span></span></h3><p>One of the most intuitive derivations of Euler’s formula involves the use of <strong>power series</strong>. It consists in expanding the power series of exponential, sine and cosine — to finally conclude that the equality holds.</p><p>As a caveat, this approach assumes that the power series expansions of $\sin z$, $\cos z$, and $e^z$ are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>absolutely convergent</strong></a> everywhere (e.g.,&nbsp; that they hold for all complex numbers $z$). However, it also has the advantage of showing that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers $z$ as well.</p><p>For a complex variable $z$, the <strong>power series expansion</strong> of $e^z$ is \[ e^z = 1 + \frac{z}{1!} + \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Now, let us take $z$ to be $ix$ (where $x$ is an <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrary</a> complex number). As $z$ gets raised to increasing powers, $i$ also gets raised to increasing powers. The <strong>first eight powers</strong> of $i$ look like this: \begin{align*} i^0 &amp; = 1 &amp; i^4 &amp; = i^2 \cdot i^2 = 1 \\ i^1 &amp; = i &amp; i^5 &amp; = i \cdot i^4 = i \\ i^2 &amp; = -1 \quad \text{(by the definition of $i$)} &amp; i^6 &amp; = i \cdot i^5 = -1 \\ i^3 &amp; = i \cdot i^2 = -i &amp; i^7 &amp; = i \cdot i^6 = -i \end{align*} (notice the <strong>cyclicality</strong> of the powers of $i$: $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$. We’ll be using these powers shortly.)</p><p>With $z = ix$, the expansion of $e^z$ becomes: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Extracting the powers of $i$, we get: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix-\frac{x^2}{2!}-\frac{i x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{i x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}-\frac{i x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \cdots \] And since the power series expansion of $e^z$ is absolutely convergent, we can rearrange its terms without altering its value. Grouping the <strong>real</strong> and <strong>imaginary terms</strong> together then yields: \[ e^{ix} = \left( 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \right) + i \left( x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) \] Now, let’s take a detour and look at the power series of <strong>sine</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cosine</strong>. The power series of $\cos{x}$ is \[ \cos x = 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \] And for $\sin{x}$, it is \[ \sin x = x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \] In other words, the last equation we had is precisely \[ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x \] which is the statement of Euler’s formula that we were looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_2_Calculus"></span>Derivation 2: Calculus<span></span></h3><p>Another neat way to establish Euler’s formula is to consider both $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$ as <strong>functions</strong> of $x$, before differentiating them to find some common property about them.</p><p>For that to happen though, one must assume that the functions $e^z$, $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ are defined and <strong>differentiable</strong> for all real numbers $x$ and complex numbers $z$. By assuming that these functions are differentiable for all complex numbers, it is also possible to show that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers as well.</p><p>First, let $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ be $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$, respectively. <strong>Differentiating</strong> $f_1$ via <a href="https://mathvault.ca/chain-rule-derivative/#Chain_Rule_%E2%80%94_A_Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain rule</a> then yields: \[ f_{1}'(x) = i e^{ix} = i f_1(x) \] Similarly, differentiating $f_2$ also yields: \[ f_{2}'(x) = -\sin x + i \cos x = i f_2(x) \] In other words, both functions satisfy the differential equation $f'(x) = i f(x)$. Now, consider the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$, which is <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-defined</a> for all $x$ (since $f_2(x) = \cos x + i\sin x$ corresponds to points on the unit circle, which are never zero). With that settled, using the <strong>quotient rule</strong> on this function then yields: \begin{align*} \left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_2}\right)'(x) &amp; = \frac{f_1’(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) f_2’(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = \frac{i f_1(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) i f_2(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = 0 \end{align*} And since the derivative here is $0$, this implies that the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$ must have been a <strong>constant</strong> to begin with. What is the value of this constant? Let’s figure it out by plugging in $x=0$ into the function: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(0) = \frac{e^{i0}}{\cos 0 + i \sin 0} = 1&nbsp; \] In other words, we must have that for all $x$: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(x) = \frac{e^{ix}}{\cos x + i \sin x} = 1&nbsp; \] which, after moving $\cos x + i \sin x$ to the right, becomes the famous formula we’ve been looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_3_Polar_Coordinates"></span>Derivation 3: Polar Coordinates<span></span></h3><p>Yet another ingenious proof of Euler’s formula involves treating exponentials as numbers, or more specifically, as complex numbers under <strong>polar coordinates</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, we already know that all non-zero complex numbers can be expressed in <strong>polar coordinates</strong> in a unique way. In particular, any number of the form $e^{ix}$ (with real $x$), which is non-zero, can be expressed as: \[ e^{ix} = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \] where $\theta$ is its <strong>principal angle</strong> from the positive real axis (with, say, $0 \le \theta &lt; 2 \pi$), and $r$ is its <strong>radius</strong> (with $r&gt;0$). We make no assumption about the values of $r$ and $\theta$, except the fact that they are functions of $x$ (which may or may not contain $x$ as variable). They will be determined in the course of the proof.</p><p>(However, what we do know is that when $x=0$, the left-hand side is $1$, which implies that $r$ and $\theta$ satisfy the <strong>initial conditions</strong> of $r(0)=1$ and $\theta(0)=0$, respectively.)</p><p>For what it’s worth, we’ll begin by <strong>differentiating</strong> both sides of the equation. By the definition of exponential, differentiating the left side of the equation with respect to $x$ yields $i e^{ix}$. After differentiating the right side of the equation, the equation then becomes: \[ i e^{ix} = \frac{dr}{dx}(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] We’re looking for an expression that is uniquely in terms of $r$ and $\theta$. To get rid of $e^{ix}$, we substitute back $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$ for $e^{ix}$ to get:<span> \[ i r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] Once there, distributing the $i$ on the left-hand side then yields: \[ r(i \cos \theta-\sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] …</span></p></section></div>

    <h3>how we interact with our tools</h3>

    <p>Consider the humble interaction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste">copy-paste</a>.</p>

    <p>Doing creative or professional work on a computer would be unthinkable without it. Yet it has many flaws—<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone-manuscript.html#shelf-as-copy-paste">visibility of the buffer contents</a>, as one example. Why haven't we been able to improve on this since the introduction of the clipboard in 1983?</p>

    <p>This is just one example: most core interactions like overlapping windows, task-switching, command lines, hyperlinks, tabbed browsing, and pinch to zoom are a decade or more old. Perhaps the tech industry <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1316475471203360769">doesn't have much ambition here</a>.</p>

    <p>Some interaction innovation is happening with voice interfaces (Alexa, Siri), camera-first interfaces (Snap, Tiktok), and <a href="https://vas3k.com/blog/augmented_reality/">virtual and augmented reality</a> including motion controls. But notable that these are mostly consumer and entertainment-oriented products, with little to offer makers or professionals to improve their productive computing lives.</p>

        <p><a href="https://clipdrop.co/">ClipDrop</a>, an experiment to update copy-paste for a world with smartphones and augmented reality.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Recent productivity-oriented interaction breakthroughs I can think of (GitHub pull requests, Google Docs suggest changes, Figma <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/">observation mode</a>, Roam backlinks) are in the application layer. These are good, but what about interactions that cross application boundaries?</p>

    <p>That brings us to a delightful subgenre of concept projects to rethink the fundamental interactions of the OS. Some of my favorites are <a href="http://artifacts.fyi/">Artifacts</a>, <a href="https://www.mercuryos.com/">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://desktopneo.com/">Desktop Neo</a>, and <a href="https://www.semilattice.xyz/">Semilattice</a>.</p>

          <rect width="50" height="10" rx="2.5" fill="#298070"></rect>
        </svg>

        <p>Concept projects to rethink the OS from the ground up.</p>
        <p>One reason I like these is that they might inspire up-and-coming designers work on productivity tools rather than consumer technology. I'd like to see more designers excited to work on the next Excel rather than the next Instagram.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Most of these rethink-the-OS concepts never go beyond a concept sketch. That hints at the deeper structural problem for innovation on core interactions: we don't have the right institutions to create, implement, and bring to market such work.</p>

    <p>Our existing institutions include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Established OS makers</strong> like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and the desktop Linux ecosystem. There are occasional bright spots here (Apple Pencil, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">cursor morphing</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13586658/microsoft-surface-dial-hands-on">Surface Dial</a>, <a href="https://xmonad.org/">tiling window managers</a>) but mostly these companies do obvious iterations on established conventions. Creative tool breakthroughs come from weird ideas and soulful design best developed by small teams not constrained by the status quo.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Startups</strong> have a <a href="https://xanadu/">boil-the-ocean</a> problem: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21274638/magic-leap-app-store-partnerships-update">Magic Leap</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-smartwatch-pioneer-pebble-lost-everything-2016-12">Pebble</a>, <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/canon-cat.html">Canon Cat</a>, and <a href="http://ohlandl.ipv7.net/2524/PenPoint_OS.html">PenPoint</a> sunk tens of hundreds of millions of dollars unsuccessfully trying to remake everything and bootstrap a developer community. On the other hand, smaller/scrappier ventures expect short time horizons (e.g. ship an MVP in three months) which are insufficient to make meaningful progress in a space like this.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong> is an academic field with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqhXYFYmZ-VfI01g9kvHI84y7ycubBncd">lots of great work</a>. But there is no good path for <a href="https://www.uclb.com/for-researchers/what-is-technology-transfer/">technology transfer</a> for these ideas to leave the lab. And HCI is weighed down by a sense of scientific rigor (”this prototype reduced median task completion time by 1.3s“) versus a subjective sense of a tool that feels good or makes the user happier in their creative life.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have a hunch that a particular flavor of industrial research lab <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWUX_QMjrvM#t=2m57s">such as Bells Labs, ARPA, and PARC</a> would be better for innovating on OS-level interactions. This is what inspired me to start <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>.</p>

    <p>Other current independent researcher efforts include <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a> and <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">DynamicLand</a>. There are also some teams who are structured as commercial entities but with an indie researcher mindset, such as <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable</a>, <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company</a>, <a href="https://makespace.fun/">MakeSpace</a>, and <a href="https://iorama.studio/">Looom</a>. Many of these have non-traditional funding sources such as nonprofit donations or crowdfunding. Whether any of these examples will yield repeatable long-term results remains to be seen.</p>

    <p><strong>The world we have:</strong> Our core tool interactions languish, partially due to lack of the right venues for innovation.</p>

    <p><strong>The world I want:</strong> Let a thousand flowers bloom of weird and wacky interaction experiments. Independent research offers an institutional vehicle for small teams to be funded over the longer term. Well-understood technology transfer process can bring lab results to widely-used products with the goal of making us all more productive and creative on our computers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>One of my favorite things is to misuse technology in creative ways. Breaking the rules without breaking the rules.</p>

<p>For example, a hobby project I built long ago was <a href="https://github.com/secretGeek/dod">DOS-on-dope</a>, a working Ruby-on-rails parody, billed as <em>the last batch-file based MVC framework you'll ever need</em>. And there was <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/console_log">a console.log() adventure</a> in which you played an old school console-adventure-game from inside the chrome developer tools.</p>

<p>The world of esoteric programming is filled with examples of people stretching the rules to breaking point, and misusing technology in creative ways. In particular (for example) I love <a href="http://wiki.secretgeek.net/quine">quines</a>. Quines are programs which output their own source code. Life is a Quine.</p>

<p>A different but somehow related topic I like is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalism</a>, in particular, this often overlooked aspect:</p>

<blockquote>Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions.</blockquote>

<p>...the tendency to <strong>make the internal external</strong>, and reveal the secrets of the building, in a somehow.... <em>brutaful</em> way. ;-).</p>

<p>A similarly intriguing idea which has fallen into disuse is the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects</a>, wherein:</p>

<blockquote>The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects.</blockquote>

<p>Putting all this together I decided to make a truly naked, brutalist html page, that is itself a quine. And this page is it.</p>

<p>Viewing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretGeek/html_wysiwyg/master/html.html">the source</a> of this page should reveal a page identical to the page you are now seeing. Nothing is hidden. It's a true "What you see is what you get."</p>

<h2>How it works.</h2>

<p>Did you know that the rules of html and css allow you to make <strong>every</strong> element visible, even elements like 'title' or 'style' or 'script', that are normally hidden from view? Those are just elements like any other. You can expose them <strong>all</strong> like so:</p>



<p>With that snippet of code (which is <strong>not</strong> a snippet of code, but an <strong>actual</strong> style block itself!) you can now see every element of this page, including that style block, the html and title tags, etc.</p>

<p>It does have one downside: every element on the page is now a "block" element, even some which should be "inline", such as "code" and "anchor" elements. We can correct this like so:</p>



<p>To give the code a more 'view source' feel, I've also applied <code>monospace</code> fonts, and a generally simple and consistent style to all elements, using a "*" selector, like so:</p>



<p>So far I've put style declarations all on one line, because ordinary html refuses to treat line breaks as "br" tags. But there is a way to make line-breaks display as line-breaks, and that is with this piece of styling:</p>



<h2>Make the internal external.</h2>

<p>The next trick is to make the internal external. We can start by ensuring that the tags themselves, such as paragraph tags, are exposed in their stark, brutal, beauty:</p>



<p>That works for "p" elements, but do we need to have custom styling for <strong>every</strong> element? If there was a way to output the "name" of a tag in html, then we could reduce all of the necessary style rules above to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
*::before {
 '&lt;' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>

<p>And...

</p><blockquote>
*::after {
 '&lt;\/' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>


<p>But alas there is no "name()" function (yet!). So we are forced to generate a chunk of style information like this (via <a href="https://nimbletext.com/Live/1105905186/">NimbleText</a> of course)</p>

<p>Please scroll happily past the next 28 offensively repetitive lines...</p>



<p>Some elements are a little trickier because they have attributes. Consider for example the "anchor" which often has a <code>href</code> attribute. We <em>need</em> that attribute to be visible, including its value. This is done like so:</p>



<p>The <code>attr()</code> function, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">mozilla docs</a> is a nifty trick, "supported" since CSS 2.</p>


<p>The only other style that is special is "style" itself, which has to include an escape character to avoid being taken literally.</p>







<p>Finally to reduce the visual weight of the before and after pseudo elements we can give them a soft purple color and a low weight font:</p>





<p>Finally, because I believe brutalist design, even when applied to truly naked brutal html quines, is about function, not about deliberate ugliness, I'd like to apply these humble styles that improve the readability of this brutiful missive.</p>



<p>...they're derived from <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">"58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere"</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing. Although this idea has bounced around in my head for a decade, the thing that reminded me to pipe it into a file was seeing this piece of "Code as Art" from Geoff Huntley: <a href="https://noyaml.com/">no yaml</a>. Bring back the world weird web.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

<p><em>Currently, my job has taken a lot of my time. But who doesn't have time for side projects? At the end of the day - they keep us sane. So I’ve been currently hacking on a good way of managing my finances - and oh boy I’m having fun.</em> </p>

<h2 id="but-why-do-you-even-bother">But why do you even bother?</h2>
<p>I’ve been keeping track of my finances for about 10 years now. No it’s not something you should absolutely do, but being raised in a household where this was the norm, I’ve naturally found myself doing it from a “young age”. </p>
<p>Of course there are many reasons to track your finances, but for me, the question is pretty simple: I just want to have the power to understand where my money goes, and where my money comes from. And since “information is power”, I’ve been a bit obsessed with documenting. </p>
<h2 id="how-i-have-tracked-my-finances-in-the-past">How I have tracked my finances in the past</h2>
<p>Like every “tracking afficionato”, I started tracking all of my finances using mobile applications. I’ve used everything from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dailycost-expense-tracker/id566587079">DailyCost</a> to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spending-tracker/id548615579">Spending Tracker</a>. But all of these had drawbacks. Not because of the apps themselves, but because they did not fit my mindset/workflow. I want to know how much I have on account X, and how much I owe to someone next month. And even though some modern alternatives already connect to your bank accounts, I wanted something more “hackable”. </p>
<p>And so I fell into “Excel hell”. I found that I could use a simple app to track my spendings (<a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a>) and then, at regular intervals I would put that information into Excel. There, I would create my own overview of “how things are going”, and “where my money was spent”. </p>
<p>But keeping track of things in Excel had various drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had no connection to my banking accounts </li>
<li>Currency exchanges are a pain in the ass (I know there are plugins, but come on..)</li>
<li>I had to create a lot of custom formulas, that were a pain to maintain</li>
<li>Excel is proprietary software, and I don’t like depending on proprietary software</li>
<li>The system was not programmable to my needs - hard to extend</li>
</ul>
<p>So after 7 years tracking my finances in Excel - I decided to look for something better (for me at least)</p>
<h2 id="enter-plain-text-accounting">Enter plain text accounting</h2>
<p><a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">Plain text accounting</a> is a movement, or even better, a community. It’s a group of people passionate about keeping track of their finances using plain text formats, programmable interfaces, and hackable workflows. </p>
<p>Imagine having a txt file where you can manage all of your finances - and hack in workflows that fit your needs exactly. That sounded just like the solution I needed.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation of <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/#plain-text-accounting-apps">command line applications</a> (because who likes GUIs?) that are inline with plain text accounting, I found <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a>. There are also other alternatives such as <a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a> (written in C++) or <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a> (written in Haskell). </p>
<p>But hey, I’m a Python guy, and want to be able to hack on this to my needs, so I went with <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-do-i-manage-my-finances-now">So how do I manage my finances now?</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is how I do it - your current situation and preferences will most likely be very different from mine - so this is by no means a tutorial - simply a showcase</em></p>
<h3 id="out-and-about">Out and about</h3>
<p>At the end of the month, I like to be able to look back and see how much I have spent in different categories such as “Entertainment”, “Groceries”, “Shopping” etc. So when I’m out in about, I usually use <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> to keep track of those. Spendee has a whole world of other features - but I simply use it for tracking simple transactions.</p>
<h3 id="the-central-piece-beancount">The central piece: <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/">Beancount</a></h3>
<p>The whole overview of my finances, uses beancount. I’m not going to go deep on how awesome beancount is, or the whole feature set that it offers. (for that you can start with the incredible <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/">documentation</a>)
It basically takes a “beacount file” and allows you to generate several reports / consistency checks/ queries on that same file.<br>
Here’s an example of a beancount file:</p>
<pre><code>; creating an account and setting some balances
2015-01-01 * "Opening Balance for checking account"
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                         3490.52 USD
  Equity:Opening-Balances                        -3490.52 USD

; an example expense
2017-04-18 * "Verizon Wireless" ""
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                          -85.18 USD
  Expenses:Home:Phone                               85.18 USD

; another example expense
2017-04-23 * "Wine-Tarner Cable" ""
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                          -80.20 USD
  Expenses:Home:Internet                            80.20 USD
</code></pre>
<p>So every month, I take my spendings, input them into my beancount file, make sure my accounts and assets all match, and basically do my “bookkeeping” on that file. For this, I use a system called “Double entry counting” (learn more <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method.html">here</a>). </p>
<h3 id="analyzing-everything-fava">Analyzing everything: <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a></h3>
<p>Even though beancount can generate some <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/running_beancount_and_generating_reports.html#tools">reports</a>, I have found that the terminal is not the best place to analyze data. </p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a> exists. Fava is a web interface for your beancount file. It allows you to have a nice to use, easy to navigate website, where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an overview of your accounts</li>
<li>Run queries on your transactions (Using the <a href="https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-sql-queries/">beanquery language</a>)</li>
<li>Visualize your data in different times/accounts/categories</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-from-anywhere">Access from anywhere</h3>
<p>To make sure I can access my beancount files anywhere, I have kept all of them synced to a nice git repo that syncs with my server. </p>
<p>I have also installed Fava on that server, which basically allows me to access my visualizations in any machine that has a web browser. </p>
<p>And oh boy do I love this setup. </p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m still improving on this setup - creating custom scripts that evaluate my position given my constraints, automatically connect to my assets, and even alarm me if something not expected happened. </p>
<p>And that’s the beauty of not using Excel. I’m now using something I can hack on and make my own - and even though that’s not a complete system - it’s a great system for me. </p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/blais">Martin Blais</a> for creating beancount and for actively maintaining and documenting such an awesome tool.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>What’s the end goal of the code review?</p>
<p>To make sure that changes work? To validate if code is following the style guide? To check if new changes will not break anything? All of these? Non of these?</p>
<p>All these questions are necessary parts of the code review, but none of them is its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the code review is to make sure that the solution is solving the problem in the best possible way. From the code and product perspective.</p>
<p>All of the code review practices are designed to this end goal.</p>
<p>But how do you determine if the solution you are reviewing is the best way to solve the problem? In other words, how to code review?</p>
<p>Let’s deep dive into it.</p>
<h2 id="no-perfect-code">No “perfect” code</h2>
<p>Before you start reviewing code you need to understand that there is no such thing as “perfect” code – there is only a “balanced” code.</p>
<p>You as a reviewer should balance out the need to make forward progress compared to the importance of the changes.</p>
<p>Stop seeking perfection.</p>
<p>You don’t just write code for code, you solve a business problem with the code.</p>
<p>If code solves a problem and improves the maintainability, readability, and understandability of the system but it’s not “perfect,” don’t delay it for weeks. Leave a comment on how the author of the changes can improve his code, and give it a green light.</p>
<h2 id="your-opinions-are-not-authority">Your opinions are not authority</h2>
<p>Everyone has their personal opinion on everything: how you should write code, how many hours, why you need to use some text editor and not another, and many others.</p>
<p>We all have different experiences and different backgrounds, but we need to turn them off during the code review.</p>
<p>When you are deciding if the solution you are reviewing is written “good” or “not”, you have to rely on technical facts and standards, not personal preference.</p>
<p>For example, while coding, you always use a semicolon at the end of the line, but the author of the code you are reviewing doesn’t. The first thing you want to do is leave a comment like “Add semicolon here.” But what you should do instead, is create a style guide and make it a standard in the team.</p>
<p>Codebase must be consistent and not written by personal preferences.</p>
<h2 id="resolving-conflicts">Resolving conflicts</h2>
<p>I have seen a lot of examples where the reviewer was wrong about "how to write code", left a comment about it while code reviewing, and after realizing that he was wrong, still decided to bend his line just not to look stupid that he didn't know something.</p>
<p>Code review is not a ring where you need to dominate your opponent. You are one team. You work toward the common goal. Everybody is your teammates.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do in the conflict is to come to a consensus. Better to do it not in the comments on GitHub but in chat or video call, it is much faster.</p>
<p>If both of you can't find a common solution on how to write code, ask your team or technical lead for help.</p>
<p>Don’t sit down on one conflict for days, try to resolve it as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="code-quality">Code quality</h2>
<p>On a high level you need to look at two things while code reviewing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Changes solve the problem.</li>
<li>Code is well designed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this, create a checklist of what you should pay attention to when reviewing the code and use it on every code review.</p>
<p>Here are my general recommendations on what you should look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changes do what the developer intended.</strong> Everything works as it is needed in the task.</li>
<li><strong>Changes are not too complex to understand.</strong> All members of the team can understand every line of code and can easily maintain this code in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Author picked good names for everything.</strong> Not long and hard to read.</li>
<li><strong>Author added comments where necessary. </strong>Good comments are those that explain why some code exists, and not what code is doing. If the code isn’t clear enough to explain itself, then the author should make the code simpler.</li>
<li><strong>Changes follow the style guide.</strong> If you don’t have a style guide in the company you should definitely create one.</li>
<li><strong>Do changes need documentation.</strong> If they change the main part of basic or main functionality (build, test, API, integration, etc.) the author needs to create or update documentation about it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test">Test</h2>
<p>Every change must be tested.</p>
<p>Ask the author to add unit, integration, or end-to-end tests as appropriate for the change, if he is not already.</p>
<p>Make sure that tests are not written to test themselves. They must be useful and valid.</p>

<p>First of all, abstract from your feelings about the person whose code you are reviewing. Always make comments about the code and not a person.</p>
<p>If you see that the author wrote a “bad” code and it somehow triggers your emotions like anger, calm down, and leave your comments on a calm mind.</p>
<p>Also, never ever write comments like “do this and not this”, always explain why the author should make changes and add the source (link to the blog post, documentation, guidelines) where the person could read more about it. But don’t write a complete solution to the problem when you explain “why”. Code review must not take you the whole day. And it’s not your job to fix the changes of another developer. Find a balance between pointing out the problem and providing a direct solution.</p>
<h2 id="be-a-human">Be a human</h2>
<p>And the last one, be a human.</p>
<p>If you found something nice in the changes, tell the author about it. Code reviews should not be just about mistakes. Give some positive feedback as well. Be a mentor.</p>
<p>For you, it may be just a small positive comment, but for someone else, it can make their day.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the End…</h2>

October 19, 2020 | https://www.tremor.rs/blog/2020-10-16-v09-release/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tremor.rs/blog/2020-10-16-v09-release/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/v0.9.png" alt="v0.9"></p><p><a href="https://www.tremor.rs/">Tremor</a> is an open source event processing and data distribution engine designed to interpose or intercept data in complex systems primarily to inject quality of service, correct data flows and to enrich or support complex traffic shaping, routing and load-balancing based on contextual, situational or content derived dynamic conditions.</p><p>Tremor has a powerful ETL language designed for flexibly pattern matching structured data such as JSON efficiently ( SIMD-accelerated ), and an easy to configure declarative flow-based SQL language designed for rich JSON like data to describe data processing and data flow graphs with declarative QoS constraints.</p><p>Tremor has been in large scale global production at Wayfair now for 2 years and is gaining adoption in other organizations.</p><p>In this release; we return to tremor’s roots and focus on quality of service by adding linked-transports to interpose RPC-like and synchronous-blocking protocols; we add circuit breakers to manage upstream and downstream byzantine events; and we provide mechanisms that offer shades of delivery guarantees or intrinsic transactions that when combined with suitable upstream or downstream systems can produce lossless data transfers for certain routes, whilst remaining best effort for routes that do not support lossless delivery or recovery in and of themselves with minimal loss.</p><p>Last, but most importantly - this is the first release of tremor as a Linux Foundation / CNCF early stage sandbox project. We would like to thank everyone
at Wayfair in Boston and Berlin, the Linux Foundation and the CNCF who facilitated, helped, nurtured, transitioned DNS entries and worked with the legals to make this transition to fully open governance happen. A huge thanks to Chris and Amye at the Linux Foundation.</p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2><p>Read on for details after these headings</p><ul><li>Refactored Concurrency Model</li><li>Unified Command Line Interface</li><li>Linked Transports</li><li>Circuit Breakers &amp; ‘Guaranteed’ Delivery</li><li>Behavioural Changes</li></ul><p>Stop here, unless you like details.</p><h2 id="refactored-concurrency-model">Refactored Concurrency Model</h2><p>The maturity of concurrency and synchronization primitives within the rust programming language has transformed massively over the past 18 months. As these primitives have now stabilised, and libraries based on these primitives are now stabilising we have migrated the tremor runtime model to be fully internally asynchronous, non-blocking and task-driven where possible.</p><p>There are still code paths within tremor; such as in kafka adapters that integrate with native libraries where a configurable number of threads can be configured and spun up - but we no longer have a thread per pipeline model.</p><p>This means tremor application designers can now configure, deploy and run 1000’s or pipelines in the same instance of tremor. In concert with the modularity theme in tremor v0.8 the quality of life/service theme of v0.9 further expands the flexibility available to tremor application designers and operators to design very high performance and highly efficient data processing and distribution solutions based on tremor.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/08_09_comparison.png" alt="08_09_comparison"></p><p><em>Feel the awesome power of asynchronous runtimes</em></p><h2 id="unified-command-line-interface">Unified Command Line Interface</h2><p>Tremor has matured to the point that we have outgrown the legacy developer and operator tooling. In this release we have unified, enhanced and extended developer and operator tooling to boldly go into a much improved quality of life for tremor users.</p><p>The new <a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/cli/">unified command line tool</a> <code>tremor</code> can generate auto-completion for your shell ( anything from zsh to powershell ), generate documentation for your modules, run tremor, debug the language intermediate forms, and has benchmark, integration, command-driven and unit testing frameworks built in.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cli1.gif" alt="cli1">
<img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cli2.gif" alt="cli2"></p><p>Everything is syntax highlighted and should conform to whichever theme you have running in your terminal. It’s like a swiss army knife - but more reliable because its German but cool, because it’s a Berliner ( in the JFK, not cake sense … )</p><h2 id="linked-transports">Linked Transports</h2><p><a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/linked-transports/">Linked Transports</a> allow bidirectional event flows in a request/response style to be built and routed through a tremor pipeline. This enables Tremor users to introspect, route, or even directly reply to incoming messages and intercept and manipulate outgoing responses. Tremor can thus be used as proxy, load-balancer or API-Gateway before or in between existing REST APIs or websocket servers.</p><p>Users can now support and host their own domain specific REST APIs that can interact with the wider ecosystem of systems interconnected with tremor - roll your own control plane and consolidate to a single pane of control - without deploying a separate solution or service.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/linked-transports.png" alt="linked-transports"></p><p>(note: replies can only be delivered to feet in 0.9, we’re trying to extend that to other limbs in later releases)</p><h2 id="circuit-breakers--guaranteed-delivery">Circuit breakers &amp; “Guaranteed” delivery</h2><p>The signal and contraflow control events within Tremor have been built upon in v0.9 to provide an event acknowledgement mechanism - this in turn provides the foundation for <a href="https://docs.tremor.rs/operations/gdcb/">guaranteed delivery and circuit breakers</a>, which enables finer grained declarative quality of service mechanisms within tremor.</p><p>We can now configure tremor applications or algorithms to <code>pick up where they left off</code> even if the tremor processes are killed and restarted. Under certain conditions ( based on configuration ) we can recover entire end to end flows - such as the lossless distribution of messages across kafka sources and sinks regardless of which participant dies and restarts.</p><p>Of course, if you choose UDP we cannot guarantee lossless delivery but tremor even on a horrible quality network should still minimise loss and recover gracefully - it just won’t do so without message loss unless there’s some application level handling of recovery.</p><p>Fully lossless transactional delivery is 10% the throughput of regular data distribution. It’s as slow as Apache Kafka for now - but we will put effort into tuning performance here if the use case arises.</p><p>Circuit breakers enable us to detect downstream system failures beyond backpressure and make informed decisions to either discard, reroute or stop dataflow. This allows a more ingrained control over behaviour in non-optimal conditions compared to “always drop” earlier tremor versions implemented.</p><p>Delivery guarantees, describes a set of functionality that improves the delivery guarantees of a tremor system. What guarantees can be given depends heavily on the upstream and downstream systems and the protocols used to communicate with them.</p><p><img src="https://www.tremor.rs/img/blog/2020-10-16/cb-gd.gif" alt="cb-gd"></p><p>Tremor’s proposal to to adjoin the CNCF as an early stage standbox project was accepted by the CNCF TOC and formal onboarding into the CNCF began and completed on time in September. This means that the tremor project’s copyright is now held by the Linux Foundation on behalf of the maintainers.</p><p>In practice what does this mean? Day to day there is no impact - currently all maintainers of the tremor project are sponsored by Wayfair. But the project now also has the support of the Linux Foundation and the CNCF and this in turn makes it easier for external organizations to adopt and contribute to in support of their own business needs and open source governance strategies.</p><p>Tremor is visible on the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">CNCF Sandbox Project page</a> and via the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF Landscape</a>. The tremor project can now access development services form the CNCF and LF ranging from artwork and website design through to visibility, marketing and promotion of the project at LF, CNCF and other conferences and events.</p><h2 id="behavioral-changes">Behavioral Changes</h2><ul><li><p><strong>REST offramp/sink:</strong></p><ul><li>In an effort to streamline the REST sink no longer adds newlines for batched events, this can now be done by using the “lines” postprocessor.</li><li><code>put</code> as an option is no longer supported instead method is now used.</li><li>Only supports one <code>endpoint</code> instead of multiple. The round robin operator with multiple offramps can be used as a much more capable replacement.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Heredocs:</strong></p><ul><li>Leading indentation is no longer stripped.</li><li>Heredocs now perform string interpolation allowing it to be used for templating of textual content. In result { and } need to be escaped.</li></ul></li><li><p>The <strong>tremor-server</strong>, <strong>tremor-query</strong>, <strong>tremor-script</strong>, and <strong>tremor-tool</strong> binaries are now all unified in the self-name <strong>tremor</strong> binary. The binary also replaces the legacy benchmark and integration testing frameworks, the 3rd party coyote command test harness and introduces a new unit testing facility for tremor-script. It’s one command to rule them all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Circuit breakers</strong> are enabled and active by default - this is a significant behavioral change in sinks/offramps that completely disconnect - this will now stop the message flow on sources/onramps. Care should be taken in a production environment with non-resilient, non-robust and non-redundant downstream connectivity as this is now an operational concern that can benefit from a much finer grained configuration surface.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>generic::backpressure</strong> operator has been renamed to <strong>qos::backpressure</strong>, for this release using the old name will emit a warning in this release but this backwards compatibility consideration will be addressed and the old name removed in the next release.</p></li><li><p>The operators <strong>runtime::tremor</strong>, <strong>grouper::bucket</strong> and <strong>script</strong> inside of <strong>trickle</strong> have their <strong>error</strong> output renamed to <strong>err</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Linked transports</strong> introduce a source nature to sinks and a sink nature to sources. This feature is in preview mode and how to configure it is very likely to change as usability issues or misconceptions are ironed out. ( v0.10 )</p></li></ul><p>On the CNCF Slack: <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/tremor">https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/tremor</a></p></div></div>]]>

Or in other words, we made side projects our main projects. Here is what we’ve learned over the last months.</p>
<p>The whole thing began as an experiment to learn new things, without knowing where it all goes. One of our first projects, <a href="https://mouseless.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mouseless</a>, was a great success already, but we failed with so many other projects. We always tried to learn something from <a href="https://blog.ueber.io/post/list-of-side-projects/">all projects</a>, though.</p>
<h2 id="we-did-too-many-things-in-parallel">We did too many things in parallel.</h2>
<p>For the last year, we had only one boundary: a limit of 160 hours per month. We calculated that we could work that much on other things without risking our primary business too much. That was all. We had no other limits.</p>
<p>That freedom enabled us to try everything out. For a while, that led to chaos. We started so many things we were motivated to work on but figured out we failed on the concept later. In August, we began to focus on <a href="https://blog.ueber.io/post/our-plan-for-tiptap-2/">one project</a> and only on that.</p>
<h2 id="we-rushed-through-projects">We rushed through projects.</h2>
<p>Feeling the pressure of building something successful (whatever that means), we rushed through some projects. We made some quick decisions, didn’t think enough through things, and sacrificed quality on our way.</p>
<p>That’s the opposite of what made us starting those self-initiated projects in the first place. We want to put time into details, make smart decisions, and build outstanding products.</p>
<h2 id="money-isnt-everything">Money isn’t everything.</h2>
<p>For the first year, we expected to make $0. We already made a decent amount of money with our macOS apps, which probably should feel like a success. But we figured out that’s not what we want to be our success metric and let it define where we put our time.</p>
<p>We don’t want to become rich, in the sense of having more money than we need. That’s not why we are doing it. We want to find a way to deliver value sustainably. And yes, that includes making money somehow, but we don’t believe that this future is in macOS utility apps. We love the open web too much to focus on a specific platform.</p>
<p>That’s why we decided to <a href="https://blog.ueber.io/post/share-everything/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open source everything</a>, though we have no clue how that will make us money.</p>
<h2 id="marketing-is-hard">Marketing is hard.</h2>
<p>We hate ads, growth hacks, and everything that has marketing in its name. That’s what we know. But we don’t know what we want to do to promote our work then, and we probably have to do it in some way.</p>
<p>We hope that blog here can become a sustainable alternative at some point. At least, sharing valuable content with people feels better than throwing money at big corporations to get ads in front of your eyeballs.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-shortcut">There is no shortcut.</h2>
<p>We tried to find shortcuts to get started, but I guess there is no shortcut. There is nothing like an overnight success. It’s all about delivering value regularly and figuring out to make money with it on the way, or that’s what we think now.</p>
<h2 id="trust-helped-a-lot">Trust helped a lot.</h2>
<p>The whole thing is a massive team effort. We are two people working on those self-initiated projects, while others work on client projects. Probably a good reason to feel pressure, but that’s not what we experienced.</p>
<p>The whole team is so supportive and shows trust in the work we do, even if it doesn’t work out financially.</p>
<h2 id="distraction-is-everywhere">Distraction is everywhere.</h2>
<p>Our main business is still creative work for clients. We tried to work less on client projects but jumped in on a few occasions. For example, we are working on a project for a pretty cool YC company this month.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that feels like a distraction. On the other hand, all those distractions are great opportunities to switch perspectives.</p>
<p>That said, the whole team is very supportive in that regard too. Everyone tries to help us to focus on self-initiated projects.</p>
<h2 id="stopping-a-project-hurts">Stopping a project hurts.</h2>
<p>Also, we experienced how hard it is to stop a project. It feels like losing something, and it feels like a failure. We fear to disappoint the people around us, the people following us, and the people supporting us.</p>
<p>That experience will hold us back from just starting something new, without considering what we do with it in the long run. We want to do fewer projects and stick to them for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="people-are-fantastic">People are fantastic.</h2>
<p>Everything we do, we share on Twitter. It’s incredible how friendly people are. We feel they want to see us succeed. So many kind humans helped us to find our way.</p>
<p>A special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/juliusgehrig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Julius Gehrig</a>, who made the Mouseless icon, also to <a href="https://twitter.com/suryaannd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Surya Anand</a>, who helped us with the <a href="https://matter.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">matter.md</a> icon, and to all the others – you know who you are!</p>
<h2 id="we-want-to-build-something-meaningful">We want to build something meaningful.</h2>
<p>After thinking about what we want to make with the freedom to build whatever we want, we decided to work in areas where we have experience. And to help people sustainably.</p>
<p>For us, open source seems to be that way. It’s accessible, transparent, sustainable, and it helps a ton of people. And we’re good with code. To test that, we decided to extend our experiment for another 12 months.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Please send me all your questions. I’m happy to <a href="https://twitter.com/hanspagel/status/1318121627972964353" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">answer them on Twitter</a> or in one of the next posts.</p>

Use of a synonym or a different construction is enough to leave the machine confused and speechless.</p><p>How do <em>we</em> go about this? The Quickchat engine is built on top of state of the art language models such as GPT-3. This makes it capable of capturing and <strong>interpreting context in a much more nuanced way</strong>. It does come at the cost of having to restrict chat bot’s scope which will be covered in future blog posts.</p><p>What follows is two examples of how this works in practice in a chat bot implementation developed for our <a href="https://quickchat.ai/">quickchat.ai</a> site to answer product-related questions.</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/blog_post_2_1_full.gif" alt="Supported use cases - image" title="Supported use cases"></p><p>Chat bot is able to recognise</p><ul><li>what use cases do you support?, and</li><li>what are some of the chat bots I could make using quickchat?</li></ul><p>as two differently-worded statements pointing to the same piece on knowledge.</p><p>In the third example, it is also recognised as the answer to <em>which ones are you focusing on right now?</em> based on earlier context.</p><p><img src="https://blog.quickchat.ai/images/blog_post_2_2_full.gif" alt="API pricing - image" title="API pricing"></p><p>In the above example, <em>pricing</em>, <em>business model</em> and <em>fee</em> have all been interpreted as querying for information about our monthly fee.</p><p>As a bonus, the last of the three conversations showcases chatbot’s flexibility to make use of <strong>locally held context</strong>. When asked about what it referred to as <em>traffic</em>, it was able to explain that it simply meant the number of messages exchanged even though the word itself has several potentially ambiguous meanings.</p><p>We’re ready to work with you and launch conversational chat bots for a wide range of use cases.

<p><em>This article is part of a series on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Myself and Rebecca are sitting down to dinner. She asks me a question.</p>



<p><em>“Were you doing lots of one-to-ones today?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah, why’d you ask?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Do you realize that you pretty much said the same thing over and over again, all day?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Huh. I had no idea. No wonder I feel so tired…”</em></p>



<p>Do you ever feel like you’re repeating yourself? You probably are.</p>



<p>Whether you’re managing one team or multiple teams, part of your job is gathering and distributing information. You likely have unique access into what is going on – and what is coming up – in the rest of the department and company, therefore it is your duty to ensure that others are continually informed.</p>



<p>However, without conscious effort, your communication efforts can be drastically inefficient, and you may not even realize.</p>



<p>Since we tend to use our <a href="http://theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/121s/">one-to-one meetings</a> with our staff as our primary way of discussing in-depth topics, we as managers can find ourselves using those meetings to additionally broadcast useful information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you might want to update people about the roadmap planning that is underway for next year, or perhaps share the latest status of the budget and what that may mean for hiring new staff.</p>



<p>After all, it seems reasonable to batch this up into your weekly one-to-one meetings and then to deliver that information face-to-face, physically or virtually. It’s a nice personal touch, right? Well, <em>maybe</em>. But you might be using your time ineffectively. And you won’t ever get that time back.</p>



<h2>You wouldn’t do it in code</h2>



<p>If you found yourself repeating a laborious manual technical task again and again, you’d probably sense that you’re being inefficient and then you would do something about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps you might:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Turn the technical task into a program</strong>, such as a bash or Python script so that you didn’t have to manually perform the steps every single time.</li><li><strong>Commit that program to a known codebase or repository</strong> so that others could find it and improve it themselves if they needed to.</li></ul>



<p>This was a common pattern during the early days of Brandwatch when we didn’t have a customer support team: the engineers did a lot of manual hacking until those hacks could be turned into features. A lot of our automated scripts became the first version of our internal admin interface for our software.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to <em>communication</em>, managers find themselves writing that metaphorical code again and again and again, without necessarily thinking that there could be a better way to operate. There almost always is. And not only will it save <em>their</em> time, it may even make the communication itself more impactful as well.</p>



<h2>Extract and broadcast what you repeatedly communicate</h2>



<p>In a given week, how much information do you communicate that is broadly applicable to all of your direct reports? If your direct reports are managers, how much of that information is applicable and relevant to <em>all</em> of their staff?</p>



<p>Here’s a little exercise for you to try out.</p>



<p>Have a think through everything that you discussed in your one-to-ones this week. What percentage of the information that you shared was repeated from one meeting to the next? You’ll be surprised: often it’s quite a lot.</p>



<p>Then you should apply your engineering brain. What you should do in the future is batch up that information as the week progresses, then hoist it up a level and then communicate it in a way that gives you the maximum one-to-many impact for the effort that you put into communicating it in the first place. (If I was to use a silly management term, I would say that you want to increase the <em>leverage</em> of your communication effort.)</p>



<p>There are a number of different ways that you could do this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Write a weekly written summary to your staff</strong>. As you collect relevant information throughout the week, start building up a bullet point list of anything that you think is worth sharing more widely. Then, once a week, turn it into a digest that you send around to everyone.</li><li><strong>Alternatively, record a video.</strong> Some people find speaking easier than writing, so why not record a short video walking through the same information if it makes the process simpler and faster for you?</li><li><strong>Organize a regular information sharing meeting or town hall.</strong> The benefit of this is that it also enables participation and you can answer questions. You can record it for future reference.</li><li><strong>Keep a document or wiki up to date that people can view at their leisure</strong>. If you have lots of “nice to know” information rather than critically important news, then this is a way of not overwhelming everyone’s inboxes. Instead, they can browse at the frequency that suits them.</li></ul>



<p>Even if it takes 30 minutes out of your week in order to prepare a broadcast communication, it’s still probably less time than you would have spent repeating yourself saying the same things over and over in your one-to-ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s nice is that you can also be sure that everyone has received <em>exactly</em> the same information, and you can take your time to ensure that it’s being broadcast in the most clear and concise way that you can muster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s <em>more</em> is that it frees up precious time in your one-to-ones for career development, coaching and helping your staff work on their biggest issues. It makes you a better manager.</p>



<p>So go on: you wouldn’t write that code again and again. So why would you communicate the same information repeatedly? Extract, abstract, and broadcast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least do it for the <a href="https://twitter.com/eleventhleft">poor souls</a> overhearing your video calls.</p>

<p>Posted October 18th, 2020</p>
<p>I like bash, and I somehow find that surprising.
Bash is dangerous, bash is old, bash is <em>simple</em>.
Other people - people I respect - like bash too.</p>
<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>Across all of the awful things that bash does wrong - that make bash a bad programming language - my biggest complaint
is the general idea that bash is unsafe.
It is unclear when - if at all - types are meaningful in bash.
Code is highly imperative.
Error-handling is almost non-existant.
Global state 😱.
This all normally spells doom.</p>
<h2>Aside: why so?</h2>
<p>I often think of programming languages on the imperative &lt;-&gt; functional axis.
I like the languages on the right, and dislike the ones on the left.</p>
<p>The obvious counter is that sometimes you need something quick and dirty, something that doesn't need to compile,
something that doesn't need expensive virtual machine spin-up.</p>
<p>We are sort of left then with bash, perl, php, python, and ruby for quick and dirty.
And, to be fair, I could imagine using <code>irb</code> as a shell environment.
The others: I could not.</p>
<p>Bash has something else going for it: it's <em>ubiquitous</em>.</p>
<p>Supposing for a moment that ubiquity is a sufficient argument to justify learning <em>some</em> bash, I imagine I haven't
convinced you: people seem to settle on a primary language, a scripting language, and some basic bash.</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you that you should just use bash as your scripting language, and any time you need "real" scripting
capabilities, you really just needed your primary language, and if your primary language seemed too clunky, that's a
problem in itself.</p>
<p>I will die on this hill: python is garbage.
Just use bash.</p>
<h2>Something something monads</h2>
<p>Bash has something more going for it.</p>
<p>When we write scripting languages like python, we normally utilise imperative state, and some nice higher level
constructs like list comprehensions, to transform some data.</p>
<p>I'll argue then that python's primary interface is the <em>collection</em>.
Python code is often all about manipulating collections.</p>
<p>Thinking about primary languages, I'll mention a couple.</p>
<p>Rust - my primary language - has a familiar ruby- or java-like syntax (a lot of methods) that many are familiar with.
But - in terms of thinking about writing code and decomposing problems, Rust's biggest win is its powerful enums and
traits.</p>
<p>So I'll argue that rust's primary interface is the <em>trait</em>, which when wielded, categorises the world and declaratively
describes the world's capabilities.</p>
<p>Java has baggage (DI, code-generation, gradle, annotation-hell), but its claim to fame is the Object.</p>
<p>Java's primary interface is in mapping the relationship between different kinds of data, and things that manipulate
data.</p>
<p>Bash has a primary interface too!</p>
<h2>I/O</h2>
<p>Bash's primary interface - and the thing that makes bash powerful, productive, and admired by all - is the fact that
everything is built around I/O.</p>
<p>In that sense, bash is hardly even a real language.
Bash just leverages subprocesses, and gives you fine control over where to wire up signals.</p>
<p>That's what makes bash elegant, but it's also what makes bash incredibly powerful, not only for composing systems, but
for decomposing software architecture into its critical signals.</p>
<p>One complaint about bash seems to be that everyone writes their own flavor of it.</p>
<p>My flavor is one big <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">pipeline</a>, with some basic
safety sprinked in.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I have a small bit of software on a cron-job which scrapes property listings online and writes a summary to a
matrix.org channel.</p>
<p>To write this software I decomposed the problem into pure I/O and only wrote the applications I needed to represent that
problem space as a pipeline (ref: <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrape">1</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/filterfrom">2</a>,
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrapex">3</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/send_glitch">4</a>).</p>
<p>This pattern is a beaut, and one I'd like to repeat more of in the future.</p>
<p>I've heard folks refer to this as "using bash as glue code", but this seems to be taking things one step further.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>My flavor of bash is better than yours, because it elevates my primary language, minimises bash's safety impact, helps
me decompose my software, and gives me a topic for a blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>▾ node_modules/

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

		<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The Ryuk threat actors went from a phishing email to domain wide ransomware in 5 hours. They escalated privileges using Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), less than 2 hours after the initial phish. They used tools such as Cobalt Strike, AdFind, WMI, and PowerShell to accomplish their objective.</p>
<p>Ryuk has been one of the most proficient ransomware gangs in the past few years, with the FBI claiming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-ransomware-victims-have-paid-out-140-million-one-version-has-cost-them-the-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$61 million USD</a> having been paid to the group as of February 2020. Earlier in the year, the group grew a little quiet, but that seems to have changed in the past few weeks, with incidents like what occurred at <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHS hospitals</a>.</p>
<h3>Case Summary</h3>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk case,</a> we saw the threat actors leverage access to an environment via the Bazar Loader malware. This time around, we saw them accomplish their objective faster, but the general tactics and techniques stayed similar between incidents.</p>
<p>Bazar was introduced to the environment again with the delivery via phishing emails. For an in depth breakdown on this loader, see <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this analysis</a> by&nbsp; Roman Marshanski &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/VK_Intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitali Kremez</a>. Bazar, once running, was seen again injecting into explorer.exe, svchost.exe, and spawning command shell processes.</p>
<p>From this loader we saw initial mapping of the domain, using built-in windows utilities such as Nltest. However, unlike the last case, the threat actors started at a lower privileged user and rather than proceed slowly or cautiously, they exploited the recently disclosed Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to reset the machine password of the primary domain controller.</p>
<p>Lateral movement was initiated via SMB file transfers and WMI executions of Cobalt Strike Beacons. The network indicators align similarly to the prior campaign and were noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1315499593359122432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Ehmke</a> in response to our last post pivoting off the prior report’s intel. From memory analysis, we were also able to conclude the actors were using a trial version of Cobalt Strike with the EICAR string present in the network configuration for the beacon. Both portable executable and DLL beacons were used.</p>
<p>After moving laterally to the secondary domain controller, the threat actor started on more domain discovery via Net and the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there, the threat actors appeared to use the default named pipe privilege escalation module on the server. At this point, the threat actors used RDP to connect from the secondary domain controller, to the first domain controller, using the built in Administrator account.</p>
<p>Once on the main domain controller, another Cobalt Strike beacon was dropped and executed. Then more domain reconnaissance was performed using <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/05/08/adfind-recon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdFind</a>. Once this completed, at the four hour mark, the threat actors were ready for their final objective.</p>
<p>Four hours and 10 minutes in, the threat actors used the pivot from the primary domain controller to RDP into the Backup server. Backup servers were again targeted first for deployment of the ransomware executable, followed by servers and then workstations.The threat actors finished their objective by executing the ransomware on the primary domain controller, and at the 5 hour mark, the attack completed.</p>
<p>While last time we commented on the lead time between the first and second day to aid detection and response activity, this case goes to show that you can’t count on that kind of timescale. You need to be ready to act in less than an hour, to make sure you can effectively disrupt the threat actor.</p>

<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>
<h3><a>Initial Access</a></h3>
<p>Access was initiated by a phishing email leading to the Bazar Loader malware executable.</p>
<h3><a>Execution</a></h3>
<p>Bazar relies on user execution of an executable to run. This user was a Domain User and did not have any other permissions.</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-1472 was used to reset the credentials on one of the domain controllers in the environment. After resetting the password, the threat actors then targeted a different domain controller, potentially due to breaking services by use of their exploit.</p>

<p>On one of the domain controllers we saw use of the Cobalt Strike named pipe escalation.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 92d8cc45954 &gt;; \\.\pipe\446b3c</pre>
<h3><a>Defense Evasion</a></h3>
<p>On the first domain controller that the treat actors connected to after their initial connection, they dropped a DLL and executed it via rundll32.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C rundll32 C:\Windows\system32\SQL.dll, StartW</pre>
<p>Dropped via RDP and executed via rundll32 on the second domain controller.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll, rundll</pre>
<p>Shortly after, the DLL was called again via regsrv32.</p>
<pre>regsvr32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll</pre>
<p>Then a 2nd DLL was dropped and executed in a similar manner on the 2nd DC.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\\PerfLogs\\socks64.dll, rundll</pre>
<h3><a>Discovery</a></h3>
<p>Ran on the beachhead.</p>
<pre>nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts

<p>They then ran the following looking for host names, operating systems and last logon dates of all AD systems.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate | Export-CSV C:\Users\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8</pre>
<p>After already completing the above discovery work and having already pivoted to their 2nd domain controller, the threat actors moved on to AdFind for further domain reconnaissance.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\Temp\adf\AdFind.exe
C:\Windows\Temp\adf\adf.bat</pre>
<p>Contents of the script ran the following with AdFind.</p>
<pre>adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
adfind.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
adfind.exe -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp</pre>
<p>The threat actor then ran this command a few times.</p>

<h3><a>Impact</a></h3>
<p>Starting around 4.5 hours after the initial Bazar malware was executed, the Ryuk threat actors acted on their final objectives and initiated RDP connections from the domain controller previously exploited, to the rest of the environment. This time they initiated the ransomware first on the secondary domain controller (their 1st pivot) and transferred the Ryuk executable over the RDP connection.</p>

<p><strong>Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Incremental computation is a programming abstraction which gives users a way of writing calculations such that, when some of the inputs change, only a relevant subset of the calculation has to be recomputed. </p>
<p>The above definition is kind of vague and honestly it's best to start with an example. Let's take a look at the following mathematical expression.  </p>
<p>$$ (a+b)*c $$</p>
<p>We can evaluate this expression in two steps. First by adding a and b together, and then by multiplying the result by c. We can even write this computation out as a dependency graph:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
Here the variables a, b, c are referred to as leaves because they have no dependencies. Now what if after we do our initial computation, the value of c changes?
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag-2.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
We can see from this graph that since (a+b) does not depend on c, we do not need to recompute it. Now imagine scaling this idea up to larger, more complex expressions. If you are familiar with spreadsheet software, you might have flashbacks to the huge interlinked computations created there. This brings us to a second, more intuitive definition of incremental computation: Microsoft Excel on steroids.
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/excel-on-steroids.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
There are several different frameworks and projects for incremental computation. These include <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">several</a> <a href="http://adapton.org/">rust</a> <a href="https://github.com/lord/anchors">libraries</a>, <a href="http://skiplang.com/">Facebook's Skip Lang</a> and an OCaml library called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>. I chose to play around with Incremental for my experiments, because it seems to be the most battle tested option.</p>
<p><strong>Pros/Cons</strong><br>
So far it may seem like incremental computation frameworks are magical abstractions which allow programmers to write incredibly efficient programs with ease. So why don't we all use them? Well like most things in software, incremental computation frameworks come with a few trade offs. <br>
Pros:  </p>
<ul>
<li>An incremental computation framework provides a simple abstraction around optimizing computations which allow programmers to write more efficiently computable programs with low mental overhead.</li>
<li>The abstraction provided by these frameworks generalizes well to many different types of problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frameworks have non negligible overhead both in speed and memory. We need to make sure the computation is slow enough to justify incrementalizing. If not, the overhead of the framework could dwarf the time it would take to recompute the expression from scratch.</li>
<li>Similar to the above point, the initial computation of the algorithm will be slower. You need to decide if you will be recomputing often enough to justify this slow down.</li>
<li>There are always limitations to any particular abstraction. Therefore you will likely be able to come up with a custom algorithm for a specific problem that is much faster than the result you get using an incremental computation framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those interested in exploring these tradeoffs in detail or wanting to peek behind the curtain will enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6a5G5i4gQU">this talk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do people use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
So where are people actually using incremental computation? As far as I know, there are a few different areas where these ideas are being applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance, especially to deal with large spreadsheet-like calculations. Most finance companies are a little vague about what they actually do, so I don't know too much about this use case.</li>
<li>Compliers, the rust compiler explored these techniques when building their incremental compilation features.</li>
<li>Databases, the company <a href="https://materialize.io/">Materialize</a> uses technology based on the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/courses/2015/6.S897/readings/naiad.pdf">Timely Dataflow Model</a> developed by Microsoft Research to create a better streaming database.</li>
<li>User Interfaces, user interfaces are a perfect place for incremental computation because it's important to figure out which components you actually need to re-render when something on the page changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How people shouldn't use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Now we can get to the fun part. Over the last week, I tried to play around with Incremental (and picked up scraps of OCaml) to get a better idea of how to actually build incremental computations. </p>
<p>Of course the first thing I did was to <a href="https://github.com/Mr4k/smash-incremental-heap">break the library</a>, but after that I decided I wanted to write a small but non trivial project which used it. Since I don't have legions of highly paid quants to create large spreadsheets, I decided that use case was off the table. I felt that building a toy compiler or database would be at least a week long project by itself without incrementalizing it, so I ruled those out as well. I'm also not a huge frontend person, so a ui framework didn't seem appeal to me that much. Instead I decided to try something different:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/in-one-weekend.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>I decided to implement (3/4s of) Peter Shirley's <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf">Ray Tracing in One Weekend tutorial</a> in OCaml and then try to incrementalize a part of the ray tracing step. I will be honest, this experiment was not the most amazing thing in the world, but I think I learned a lot about what not to do with incremental computation. </p>
<p>Is this a terrible idea? Absolutely! But we can learn a lot but understanding why exactly it's terrible.</p>
<p>So how does the graph based incremental computation I talked about above even fit in with ray tracing? It turns out shooting light rays into space can be thought of as a graph.</p>
<p>First of all let's look the process of tracing one ray of light from observer to light source.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/inital-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above diagram, we can see a ray of light traced backwards from the viewers eye to a light source. In between, it bounces off of both a red and blue sphere.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/ray-trace-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>The light blue circles are nodes in an incremental computation graph and the arrows are directed edges between them. Whenever a ray hits an object, a new incremental node is created. This node computes the location of the next bounce by reflecting the incoming ray, and depends on the location and direction of the last bounce. This means that if the direction of a previous ray in the chain changes, all subsequent ray bounces will be recomputed.</p>
<p>We can also fit additional metadata about our scene into the graph. For example, each object that a light ray hits will have a material associated with it.</p>
<p>In my model, these materials have color but also a "fuzziness" parameter that represents how reflective the material is. If the material is perfectly reflective, incoming light rays are reflected so that the angle of incedence is exactly equal to the angle of reflection. Otherwise there is a random jitter applied to the outgoing direction of the ray. The size of this jitter is controlled by the "fuzziness" parameter. </p>
<p>So the material parameters affect the final image color, as well as the direction of the outgoing ray. When the fuzziness of a material changes, we must recast all subsequent rays bouncing off of any objects which use that material. We can represent this dependency in our graph as follows: </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/render-graph-with-materials.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above graph, if the fuzziness of a material changes, we will recast all subsequent rays.</p>
<p>Handling changing material parameters will be the focus of our render. The idea is that after an expensive render, an artist could tweak a few material parameters without having to redraw the entire screen.</p>
<p>But what about moving objects around? For this experiment, I decided not to implement this (fairly important) feature because I could not find a way to make it fit as nicely into the abstraction provided by Incremental. If I really wanted to do this, I'd basically just store all the rays inside a spatial acceleration structure like a octree. Then whenever a sphere's position changed, I'd query the set of rays intersecting it before and after it moved. I'd then recompute each of the nodes associated with these rays.  </p>
<p>So anyways does this material editing approach actually work? The answer is somewhat.</p>
<p>Here's a gif of it in action (in real time)!
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/trace-reload.gif" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>In the above gif, each material's color and fuzziness parameters are being changed one sphere at a time. Instead of doing a full render each time something changes, Incremental figures out which rays need to be recomputed. The image above looks grainy because I'm casting only about 10 rays per pixel (for reference,  Shirley's code, which this is based off, does 100 rays per pixel). To see why I'm only taking 10 samples per pixel, let's look at some performance numbers: </p>
<table>

    <th># Rays Cast (x129600)</th>

</tbody></table>

<p>
The benchmarks above are all taken on my 2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 2015 Macbook Pro with 8GB of memory. They each used 100 spheres, each with its own unique material. Each sphere's material was changed once and I recorded the time it took to rerender after each sphere's material had changed. Each ray cast bounced a maximum of 10 times through the scene. The non incremental version is my implementation of Peter Shirley's code. Both versions of the code are single threaded.</p>
<p>Okay let's talk though this data quickly. The first four rows of the table tell a consistent story. The initial render has about a 3x to 4x overhead and editing a sphere's material results is significantly faster than a full redraw. All the numbers seem to scale linearly with the number of rays cast as expected.</p>
<p>But what about the rows after that? Runtime seems to explode in the incremental version. I was really surprised by this result. I don't have a definitive answer to this question but it did make me rethink the overhead that a library like Incremental brings to a program.</p>
<p><strong>Overhead of Incremental</strong><br>
At first glance, accounting for the runtime overhead of Incremental seems like it would be pretty simple. Each node that is fired requires a little bookkeeping on the Incremental side. As far as I know this overhead is typically on the order of ~50-150ns per node on commodity hardware and should grow linearly. The …</p></div></div></div>

So, let’s explore the landscape and (just maybe) uninstall and forget about Docker altogether…</p>

October 18, 2020 | https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/javascript-from-front-end-to-full-stack-development | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/javascript-from-front-end-to-full-stack-development">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Moving from front-end to backend development raised many questions in my mind. What is backend development, and why do I need to learn it? Will I be able to master it?</p>
<p>Junior developers usually start their career tinkering with front-end libraries, like Vue.JS, for example, before deciding they are moving to something more challenging to grasp, like Node.JS.<br>Front-end developers deal more with visual elements and static code analysis. They handle more with how the site looks to the visitors, and hence their programming language knowledge doesn't necessitate anything other than JavaScript.<br>The idea behind "full-stack development" is to practically connect developers with the whole exchange dynamics between both front- and backends. Front-end is only a presentation layer, and all the dynamic data displayed on it comes from the backend.<br>Full-stack developers are precious experts since they understand every aspect of the system they are building and can solve complex problems that involve multiple variables.<br>Now that we know the eagle-eye perspective full-stack developers have, let's find out what it takes to make a transition from front-end site development into the backend.</p>
<p><em>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine</em>. Being asynchronous and event-driven, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.<br>I know that is a lot to digest but I will break it all that down in smaller pieces, so it becomes easier to understand.<br>Let's see the progression of an advancing front-end developer who decided to take upon Node.JS. I choose to use a demo project since anything other than that might prove overcomplicated and undoubtedly reduce the learning effect from this exercise.</p>
<h2>Why Node.js is a runtime environment?</h2>
<p>Before Node.js, JavaScript could only run in a web browser for tasks like DOM manipulation, handling user events on a webpage or sending requests to a web server. But in 2009, <em>Ryan Dahl</em> released Node.js by combining the event loop, the fastest JavaScript engine V8 and C++.<br>Node is an executable file in virtually any environment. It operates as a standalone application and can work independently of the browser. Anything that takes place on the server can be handled by Node, including tasks such as user requests or database queries.</p>
<h2>Event-driven Node.js</h2>
<p>Node.js allows developers to use event-driven programming architecture for specific tasks.</p>
<pre><code>const writer = require("getWritableStreamSomehow");
writer.write("hello, Node.js \n");
writer.on("finish", () = &gt; {
  console.log("All writes are now complete.");
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <strong>getWritableStreamSomehow</strong> is not a real module or library. It is only used to demonstrate the idea behind event-driven programming in Node.js.<br>The writer module has an "<strong>on</strong>" function is used to handle some event on the writable stream. Once the writer function finishes outputting the "hello …" message, it will fire the "finish" event. The "on" function will listen and wait for it to finish. A callback function is then triggered, and the console prints: "All writes are now complete."</p>
<h2>The asynchronous nature of Node.js</h2>
<p>The asynchronous nature of Node.js manifests in the fact that our written code does not have to wait for long-running tasks to complete. It can continue to run the remainder of our code and run the callback assigned to our long-running task <em>when</em> it completes.</p>
<pre><code>const foo=()=&gt;{
  someLongRunningFunction("some Parameter",()=&gt;{
    // code to run when the task completes.
    console.log("long running function completed");
  });
  // do some other task.
  console.log("some other task completed");
}
foo(); 
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, when the execution reaches the long-running function, the code written below the function will not have to wait for it to complete, but it will run and the message "some other task completed" <em>will</em> print. Some examples of long-running functions include executing a database query, writing or reading a large file from the file system, or making requests to other servers. The message "long-running task completed" <em>will only</em> print when that task is completed. This is the main reason for the performance of Node.js. It can handle other user requests asynchronously without waiting for some long-running I/O task to complete.<br><em>Now that you know the basic idea behind Node.js, let us get started with setting up Node.js for development.</em></p>
<h2>Setting up Node.js for development</h2>
<p>You can download the latest stable version of Node from this <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.3/node-v12.18.3-x64.msi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">link</a> and install it. After installing Node.js, open your terminal (cmd in windows and bash for mac). Type "<strong>node</strong>" and hit "enter". If a welcome message appears with the installed Node version, we are good to go.</p>
<p>Now we need a code editor to write our code. Personally, I prefer <strong><em>Visual Studio</em></strong><strong> Code</strong> for development. It offers smooth performance, a lightweight code editor, and plenty of extensions for increased productivity. Use the link below to download and install the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> or any other IDE of your preference. </p>
<p>In this guide I will be developing a CRUD (stands for Create – Read – Update - Delete) application with Node.js. First, I will start by setting up the files for our project.<br>We'll start with the basics, and then continue along. The end result will be a fully working API, exposing our <strong>todoApp</strong> Application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new folder in the desired directory with any name of your choice. I will choose <strong>todoApp</strong>. </li>
<li>Open VS code and open the todoApp project folder. </li>
<li>Open your terminal and browse to the current working directory </li>
<li>Type "<em>npminit</em>" and hit enter, and it will ask you a series of questions. Preferably answer or skip them by hitting enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above procedure will create a package.json file in the <em>todoApp</em><em> directory</em>. Create a new folder named "<strong>src</strong>". Within the "<strong>src</strong>" folder, create an app.js file. </p>
<h2>Requiring/Importing modules</h2>
<p>In any framework, we need to import helper libraries and modules. Node.js modules are simple JavaScript files that expose functions, interfaces, or classes to use in our code.<br>In Node.js, importing modules is <em>requir</em><em>ed</em> because it uses the '<strong>require</strong>' function to do so. For reference, <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v13.x/api/modules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here is a list of all native modules supported by Node.js</a>. </p>
<p>In the <strong>app.js </strong>file, I will be importing the '<strong>fs</strong>’ module, also known as the file system module. This module allows us to perform tasks related to the host computers’ file system. <br>To avoid moving forward and backward, please create a second folder under <strong>todoApp </strong>called 'data'. This is where we will write our data file into later. </p>
<p>Take a look at the code below:</p>
<pre><code>const fs = require("fs"); 
data = { name: "Sveti", age: "31" };
fs.writeFile("./data/data.json", JSON.stringify(data), (err) =&gt; {
if(!err){
    console.log("data written to file successfully");
  } 
});
</code></pre>
<p>The '<strong>require'</strong> function uses the name of a module. It passes as <em>a parameter</em>. '<strong>Require</strong>' practically imports functionality from the library into our source program and allows us to use the methods therein. </p>
<h2>Writing to a file </h2>
<p>In the first line, I defined a constant named '<strong>fs</strong>' and I assigned it the fs module's contents returned by the '<strong>require</strong>' function. Now all the File System module methods are available to me on the fs constant as an object. </p>
<p>Next, I am writing a simple JSON data object to a file named <strong>data.json </strong>to the '<strong>data</strong>' folder we created previously. The <strong>fs.writeFile </strong>function can take the following arguments: </p>
<ol>
<li>Path to file (type <strong><em>String</em></strong>). </li>
<li>Data to be written (type <strong><em>String</em></strong>), please <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback">read follow this documentation</a> for more info. </li>
<li>Options (Mainly filesystem related), optional </li>
<li>The callback will be called when the writing process completes. The callback takes a single argument of type <strong>err </strong>and is also optional. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Please note</em><em>:</em> With Node.js, you should always use asynchronous functions, as you will get the best performance. </p>
<p>If the file exists at the given path, the <strong>fs.writeFile </strong>function will overwrite it. If the file does not exist, a new file with the same name will be created, and write the data passed through the second parameter.<br></p><p>Please note that I am passing the JSON object after stringifying it because it will be written as an 'Object' without it.<br>After writing the data, when the callback executes, it will return an error if occurred or return null. I will handle the error using a simple 'if' statement. To run the above code, type '<strong>node src/app.js</strong>' in the terminal and hit enter.<br>We get the output as “<i>data written to a file successfully.</i>” <em>Yessss</em>! We ran our first Node.js code successfully. Now let’s check the file <em>data.json</em> in the data folder. Just open the data.json file, and take a look!</p>
<h2>Reading from a file</h2>
<pre><code>const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("./data/data.json", { encoding: "utf-8" }, (err, data) =&gt; {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(data));
    return;
  }
  console.log(err);
});</code></pre>
<p>I wrote some data in the data.json file; let's read it now. I will be using the <strong>fs.readFile</strong> method. The <strong>fs.readFile</strong> function takes the following three arguments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Path to file (type <strong>String</strong>)</li>
<li>Options such as encoding; buffer is used by default</li>
<li>Finally, the callback will be called when the reading process completes. The callback takes two arguments: error and data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that I am parsing the data returned to us to convert the previously written stringified data to a JSON object.<br>Let’s run our code. Now I get output on the terminal as the same data is written previously:</p>
<pre><code>{ name: "Sveti", age: "31" }</code></pre>
<h2>Exporting from a file</h2>
<p>Suppose I am building a web API for a <strong>todo app</strong> where the client app sends 'http requests' to perform CRUD operations on their todo's. But I want to validate data sent to my server so that my database or storage doesn't get filled with impractical data. I can create a function that validates inputs from my users.<br>I could create this function in our main <strong>app.js</strong> file, but it is good practice always to shift code to separate files to keep the codebase manageable.<br>I will create a new folder named '<strong>utils</strong>' in my <em>todoApp folder</em> and add a new file called '<strong>validator.js</strong>'.<br>Now let me create a new function …</p></div></div>

		<p>This blog post continues the series which is a guide through the code analyzers available on the market and their possibilities. I’m trying to help you answer the question: <strong>“Which analyzer package should I use and how to configure it to avoid problems related to async/await?"</strong>. In <a href="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/async-analyzers-p1/">the previous episode</a>, I presented the first seven most common code smells related to asynchronous programming. Today, I present the next seven traps from this area. Lucky you, they can be easily avoided with an appropriate analyzer - for every issue, I provide entries for <code>.editorconfig</code> that configure analyzers that can detect it. Links to NuGet packages, as well as a complete list of analyzers’ rules, can be found in the previous article.</p>
<h2 id="async-code-smells">Async Code Smells<a href="#async-code-smells" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>
<h3 id="8-synchronous-waits">8. Synchronous waits<a href="#8-synchronous-waits" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p><code>async/await</code> keywords are viral, which means if you want to await asynchronous expression and you are in the non-asyc method, then you are forced to rewrite the whole call chain to asynchronous. The easier solution seems to be calling <code>Wait</code> or <code>Result</code> on the returned task but it’s just asking for trouble. This solution will cost you two threads for that execution, or even result in a deadlock. This problem is more widely described in <a href="https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md#avoid-using-taskresult-and-taskwait">
ASP.NET Core Diagnostic Scenarios - Asynchronous Programming</a>. I highly recommend reading this article - you will find there even more asynchronous code smells.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{
    Thread.Sleep(1); // Reported diagnostics: MA0045
    Task.Delay(2).Wait();  // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045
    var result1 = GetAsync().Result; // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045, AsyncifyInvocation
    var result2 = GetAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult(); // Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD002, MA0045
    var unAwaitedResult3 = GetAsync();
    var result3 = unAwaitedResult3.Result; // Reported diagnostics:  VSTHRD002, MA0045, AsyncifyVariable
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomething()
{
    await Task.Delay(1);
    await Task.Delay(2);    
    var result1 = await GetAsync();
    var result2 = await GetAsync();
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># VSTHRD002: Avoid problematic synchronous waits
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD002.severity = error

# MA0045: Do not use blocking call (make method async)
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0045.severity = error

# AsyncifyInvocation: Use Task Async
dotnet_diagnostic.AsyncifyInvocation.severity = error

# AsyncifyVariable: Use Task Async
dotnet_diagnostic.AsyncifyVariable.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p><code>Asyncify</code> package has a very simple diagnostic - it only detects usage of <code>Task.Result</code> property. <strong>However, it has a very powerful code fix which can automatically rewrite the whole synchronous call chain to the one that uses <code>async/await</code> keywords:</strong></p>

</p>
<p><code>vs-threading</code> has a similar code fix, unfortunately right now it is totally broken <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading/issues/454">Issue #454</a>.</p>
<h3 id="9-missing-configureawaitbool">9. Missing ConfigureAwait(bool)<a href="#9-missing-configureawaitbool" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>By default, when we await asynchronous operation using the <code>await</code> keyword, the continuation is scheduled using captured SynchronizationContext or TaskScheduler. This comes with additional performance cost and might result in a deadlock, depending on the SynchronizationContext/TaskScheduler provided by the environment - especially in <code>WindowsForms</code>, <code>WPF</code> and old <code>ASP.NET</code> application (yes, ASP.NET Core is not using SynchronizationContext). <code>ConfigureAwait</code> method wraps returned task into <code>ConfiguredTaskAwaitable</code> structure which changes the logic of scheduling the continuation. By calling <code>ConfigureAwait(continueOnCapturedContext: false)</code> we are ensuring that the current context (if provided) is ignored while invoking the continuation. Setting <code>continueOnCapturedContext</code> parameter to <code>true</code> doesn’t make any sense. If you want to go into the details about this subject, I recommend reading <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/">ConfigureAwait FAQ</a> by <code>Stephen Toub</code>.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await DoSomethingElse(); //Reported diagnostics: ASYNC0004, MA0004, RCS1090, VSTHRD111, CA2007
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await DoSomethingElse().ConfigureAwait(false);
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># ASYNC0004: Use ConfigureAwait(false) on await expression
dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0004.severity = error

# MA0004: Use .ConfigureAwait(false)
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0004.severity = error

# RCS1090: Call 'ConfigureAwait(false)'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1090.severity = error

# VSTHRD111: Use ConfigureAwait(bool)
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD111.severity = error

# CA2007: Consider calling ConfigureAwait on the awaited task
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2007.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p>All of the above analyzers offer appropriate code fixes. You can easily add “ConfigureAwait(false)` to all await expressions in one go:</p>

<h3 id="10-returning-null-from-a-task-returning-method">10. Returning null from a Task-returning method<a href="#10-returning-null-from-a-task-returning-method" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Returning <code>null</code> value from a non-async method that declares <code>Task/Task&lt;&gt;</code> as a returning type results in <code>NullReferenceException</code> if somebody awaits the method invocation. To avoid that, you should always return the result from this kind of method using <code>Task.CompletedTask</code> or <code>Task.FromResult&lt;T&gt;(null)</code> helpers.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>Task DoAsync() 
{
    return null; //Reported diagnostics: MA0022, VSTHRD114
}

Task&lt;object&gt; GetSomethingAsync() 
{
    return null;  //Reported diagnostics: MA0022, VSTHRD114, RCS1210
}

Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; TryGetAsync(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    return httpClient?.GetAsync("/some/endpoint"); //Reported diagnostics: RCS1210
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>Task DoAsync() 
{
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

Task&lt;object&gt; GetSomethingAsync() 
{
    return Task.FromResult&lt;object&gt;(null);
}

Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; TryGetAsync(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    return httpClient?.GetAsync("/some/endpoint") ?? Task.FromResult(default(HttpResponseMessage));
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># MA0022: Return Task.FromResult instead of returning null
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0022.severity = error

# RCS1210: Return Task.FromResult instead of returning null.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1210.severity = error

# VSTHRD114: Avoid returning a null Task
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD114.severity = error
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, none of the analyzers is able to detect all three cases, so we should go with one of two combinations: <code>RCS1210</code> with <code>VSTHRD114</code> or <code>RCS1210</code> with <code>MA0022</code>.</p>
<h3 id="11-asynchronous-method-names-should-end-with-async">11. Asynchronous method names should end with Async<a href="#11-asynchronous-method-names-should-end-with-async" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>I’m not a fan of this rule. It adds unnecessary noise and reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">hungarian notation</a>. In the description of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading/blob/master/doc/analyzers/VSTHRD200.md">VSTHRD200</a> we can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>The .NET Guidelines for async methods includes that such methods should have names that include an "Async" suffix.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I wasn’t able to find the original document and there’s nothing about it in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines">Framework Design Guidelines - Naming Guidelines</a>. IMHO, this naming convention only makes sense when a class provides both synchronous and asynchronous versions of a given method - this is the case mostly for APIs that were created before the <code>async/await</code> era. Anyway, if this rule belongs to your coding standard, you can easily spot all the violations with the following diagnostics: <code>VSTHRD200</code>, <code>ASYNC0001</code>, <code>RCS1046</code>.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomething() //Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD200, ASYNC0001, RCS1046
{
    await Task.Yield();
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    await Task.Yield();
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># ASYNC0001: Asynchronous method names should end with Async
dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0001.severity = error

# VSTHRD200: Use "Async" suffix for async methods
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD200.severity = error

#RCS1046: Asynchronous method name should end with 'Async'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1046.severity = error
</code></pre>
<h3 id="12-non-asynchronous-method-names-shouldnt-end-with-async">12. Non asynchronous method names shouldn’t end with Async<a href="#12-non-asynchronous-method-names-shouldnt-end-with-async" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>This rule definitely makes more sense for me than the previous one. Adding <code>Async</code> suffix to the non-asynchronous method might cause confusion. I think this code smell is rather a result of careless refactoring or requirement changes than intended action.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>void DoSomethingAsync() //Reported diagnostics: VSTHRD200, ASYNC0002, CS1047
{    
}
</code></pre>
<p>✔️ Correct</p>
<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{    
}
</code></pre>
<p>🛠️ Configuration</p>
<pre><code># VSTHRD200: Use "Async" suffix for async methods
dotnet_diagnostic.VSTHRD200.severity = error

# ASYNC0002: Non asynchronous method names should end with Async
dotnet_diagnostic.ASYNC0002.severity = error

# RCS1047: Non-asynchronous method name should not end with 'Async'.
dotnet_diagnostic.RCS1047.severity = error

</code></pre>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that <code>VSTHRD200</code> is tracking both naming deviations, it simply checks if the <code>Async</code> suffix is applied correctly. It might be good if you need both rules, but if you just need to check if the <code>Async</code> suffix is not applied to synchronous methods, then you should rather use <code>ASYNC0002</code> or <code>RCS1047</code>.</p>
<h3 id="13-pass-cancellation-token">13. Pass cancellation token<a href="#13-pass-cancellation-token" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Forgetting about passing the cancellation token might cost you a lot of trouble. Log running operation without a cancellation token can block the action of stopping the application or can result in thread starvation when there’s a lot of canceled web requests. To avoid such problems, you should always provide and pass a cancellation token to the methods that accept it, even if it’s an optional parameter. <code>Meziantou.Analyzer</code> package implements two diagnostics which can detect missing cancellation token: <code>MA0032</code> is reported always when we skip cancellation token parameter and <code>MA0040</code> is reported only when there’s a cancellation token in current scope that can be used. You can find more details about those analyzers in the article from analyzers author <a href="https://www.meziantou.net/detect-missing-cancellationtoken-using-a-roslyn-analyzer.htm">
Detect missing CancellationToken using a Roslyn Analyzer</a>.</p>
<p>❌ Wrong</p>
<pre><code>public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetSomethingA(HttpClient httpClient, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri("/some/endpoint")); //Reported diagnostics: MA0040
    return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetSomethingB(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(new Uri("/some/endpoint")); //Reported diagnostics: MA0032
    return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code.

<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>

<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-*</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>) (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                   </span><span>when-true</span><span>))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-false (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-bool</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>church-true</code> would return the first argument (true), and our <code>church-false</code> would return the second one! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-true)</span>
<span>; =&gt; true</span>
<span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-false)</span>
<span>; =&gt; false</span></code></pre><p>Do they look familiar? …</p></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article">
    <p>Although I still read a lot, during my college sophomore years my reading
habits shifted from novels to more academic works. Indeed, reading dry
textbooks and economic papers for classes often kept me from reading anything
else substantial. Nowadays, I tend to binge read novels: I won't touch a book
for months on end, and suddenly, I'll read 10 novels back to back<sup id="fnref:dune"><a href="#fn:dune" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the start of a novel binge, I always follow the same ritual: I take out my
e-reader from its storage box, marvel at the fact the battery is still pretty
full, turn on the WiFi and check if there are OS updates. And I have to admit,
Kobo Inc. (now Rakuten Kobo) has done a stellar job of keeping my e-reader up
to date. I've owned this model (a Kobo Aura 1<sup>st</sup> generation) for 7
years now and I'm still running the latest version of Kobo's Linux-based OS.</p>
<p>Having recently had trouble updating my Nexus 5 (also manufactured 7 years ago)
to Android 10<sup id="fnref:nexus"><a href="#fn:nexus" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, I asked myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why is my e-reader still getting regular OS updates, while Google stopped
issuing security patches for my smartphone four years ago?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To try to answer this, let us turn to economic incentives
theory.</p>
<p>Although not the be-all and end-all some think it is<sup id="fnref:incentives"><a href="#fn:incentives" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, incentives
theory is not a bad tool to analyse this particular problem. Executives at
Google most likely followed a very business-centric logic when they decided to
drop support for the Nexus 5. Likewise, Rakuten Kobo's decision to continue
updating older devices certainly had very little to do with ethics or loyalty
to their user base.</p>
<p>So, what are the incentives that keep Kobo updating devices and why are they
different than smartphone manufacturers'?</p>
<h2>A portrait of the current long-term software support offerings for smartphones and e-readers</h2>
<p>Before delving deeper in economic theory, let's talk data. I'll be focusing on
2 brands of e-readers, Amazon's Kindle and Rakuten's Kobo. Although the
e-reader market is highly segmented and differs a lot based on geography,
Amazon was in 2015 the clear worldwide leader with 53% of the worldwide
e-reader sales, followed by Rakuten Kobo at 13%<sup id="fnref:ereader_sales"><a href="#fn:ereader_sales" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On the smartphone side, I'll be differentiating between Apple's iPhones and
Android devices, taking Google as the barometer for that ecosystem. As mentioned
below, Google is sadly the leader in long-term Android software support.</p>
<h4>Rakuten Kobo</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019690433">their website</a> and to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_eReader#Chronological_Overview">Wikipedia
table</a>, the only e-readers Kobo has deprecated are the original
Kobo eReader and the Kobo WiFi N289, both released in 2010. This makes their
oldest still supported device the Kobo Touch, released in 2011. In my book,
that's a pretty good track record.  Long-term software support does not seem to
be advertised or to be a clear selling point in their marketing.</p>
<h4>Amazon</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW">their website</a>, Amazon has dropped support for
all 8 devices produced before the Kindle Paperwhite 2<sup>nd</sup> generation,
first sold in 2013. To put things in perspective, the first Kindle came out in
2007, 3 years before Kobo started selling devices. Like Rakuten Kobo, Amazon
does not make promises of long-term software support as part of their
marketing. </p>
<h4>Apple</h4>
<p>Apple has a very clear <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624">software support policy</a> for all their
devices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod or Mac products may obtain a service and parts
from Apple or Apple service providers for five years after the product is no
longer sold – or longer, where required by law.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means in the worst-case scenario of buying an iPhone model just as it is
discontinued, one would get a minimum of 5 years of software support.</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>Google's policy for their Android devices is to provide software support for <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en">3
years after the launch date</a>. If you buy a Pixel device just
before the new one launches, you could theoretically only get 2 years of
support. In 2018, Google decided OEMs would have to provide security updates
for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019356/android-security-update-mandate-google-contract">at least 2 years</a> after launch, threatening not to license
Google Apps and the Play Store if they didn't comply.</p>
<h2>A question of cost structure</h2>
<p>From the previous section, we can conclude that in general, e-readers seem to
be supported longer than smartphones, and that Apple does a better job than
Android OEMs, providing support for about twice as long.</p>
<p>Even Fairphone, <strong>who's entire business is to build phones designed to last and
to be repaired</strong> was not able to keep the Fairphone 1 (2013) updated for more
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone_1#Software_updates">a couple years</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone_2#Software">seems to be struggling</a> to keep the
Fairphone 2 (2015) running an up to date version of Android.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever worked in IT will tell you: maintaining software over time
is hard work and hard work by specialised workers is expensive. Most commercial
electronic devices are sold and developed by for-profit enterprises and
software support all comes down to a question of cost structure. If companies
like Google or Fairphone are to be expected to provide long-term support for
the devices they manufacture, they have to be able to fund their work somehow.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, people would be paying for the cost of said long-term
support, as it would likely be cheaper then buying new devices every few years
and would certainly be better for the planet. Problem is, manufacturers aren't
making them pay for it.</p>
<p>Economists call this type of problem externalities: things that should be
part of the cost of a good, but aren't for one a reason or another. A classic
example of an externality is pollution. Clearly pollution is bad and leads to
horrendous consequences, like climate change. Sane people agree we should
drastically cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and yet, we aren't.</p>
<p>Neo-classical economic theory argues the way to fix externalities like
pollution is to <em>internalise</em> these costs, in other words, to make people pay
for the "real price" of the goods they buy. In the case of climate change and
pollution, neo-classical economic theory is plain wrong (spoiler alert: it
often is), but this is where band-aids like the carbon tax comes from.</p>
<p>Still, coming back to long-term software support, let's see what would happen
if we were to try to internalise software maintenance costs. We can do this
multiple ways.</p>
<h3>1 - Include the price of software maintenance in the cost of the device</h3>
<p>This is the choice Fairphone makes. This might somewhat work out for them since
they are a very small company, but it cannot scale for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This strategy relies on you giving your money to an enterprise <u>now</u>,
   and trusting them to "Do the right thing" <u>years later</u>. As the years
   go by, they will eventually look at their books, see how much ongoing
   maintenance is costing them, drop support for the device, apologise and move
   on. That is to say, enterprises have a clear economic incentive to promise
   long-term support and not deliver. One could argue a company's reputation
   would suffer from this kind of behaviour. Maybe sometime it does, but most
   often people forget. Political promises are a great example of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprises go bankrupt all the time. Even if company X promises 15 years of
   software support for their devices, if they cease to exist, your device will
   stop getting updates. The internet is full of stories of IoT devices getting
   bricked when the parent company goes bankrupt and their servers disappear.
   This is related to point number 1: to some degree, you have a disincentive
   to pay for long-term support in advance, as the future is uncertain and
   there are chances you won't get the support you paid for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selling your devices at a higher price to cover maintenance costs does not
   necessarily mean you will make more money overall — raising more money to
   fund maintenance costs being the goal here. To a certain point, smartphone
   models are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good">substitute goods</a> and prices higher than market prices will
   tend to drive consumers to buy cheaper ones. There is thus a disincentive to
   include the price of software maintenance in the cost of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People tend to be bad at rationalising the total cost of ownership over a
   long period of time. Economists call this phenomenon
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a>. In our case, it means people are far more likely
   to buy a 500$ phone each 3 years than a 1000$ phone each 10 years. Again,
   this means OEMs have a clear disincentive to include the price of long-term
   software maintenance in their devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, life is more complex than how I portrayed it: enterprises are not
perfect rational agents, altruism exists, not all enterprises aim solely for
profit maximisation, etc. Still, in a capitalist economy, enterprises wanting
to charge for software maintenance upfront have to overcome these hurdles one
way or another if they want to avoid failing.</p>
<h3>2 - The subscription model</h3>
<p>Another way companies can try to internalise support costs is to rely on a
subscription-based revenue model. This has multiple advantages over the previous
option, mainly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It does not affect the initial purchase price of the device, making it easier
   to sell them at a competitive price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It provides a stable source of income, something that is <em>very</em> valuable to
   enterprises, as it reduces overall risks. This in return creates an incentive
   to continue providing software support as long as people are paying.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If this model is so interesting from an economic incentives point of view, why
isn't any smartphone manufacturer offering that kind of program? The answer is,
they are, but not explicitly<sup id="fnref:subscribe"><a href="#fn:subscribe" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Apple and Google can fund part of their smartphone software support via the 30%
cut they take out of their respective app stores. A <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2019">report from Sensor
Tower</a> shows that in 2019, Apple made an estimated US$ 16 billion
from the App Store, while Google raked in US$ 9 billion from the Google Play
Store. Although the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019">Fortune 500 ranking</a> tells us this respectively
is "only" 5.6% and 6.5% of their gross annual revenue for 2019, the profit
margins in this category are certainly higher than any of their other products.</p>
<p>This means Google and Apple have an important incentive to keep …</p></div></div>

<p>Legos are an excellent meta-toy in that they represent the potential for a near-infinite number of toys depending on how you assemble them. Each brick has structure. But each brick is only interesting to the extent that it can combine with other bricks, forming new and more complex structures. So in order to enjoy Legos, you have to figure out how they fit together and come up with a clever way of making the particular toy you have in mind. Once you have mastered a few simple rules, the open-ended design of Lego bricks lets you build anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>Our universe has the same versatile structure. It seems to run according to just a few simple forces, but as those forces interact, they give rise to intricate patterns across many scales of space and time. You see this everywhere you look in nature – in the fractal design of a seashell or the intricate polities of a coral. In the convection of a teacup or the circulation of the atmosphere. And this simple structure even determines the shape and behavior of man’s most complicated flying machines.</p>

<p>To see this more clearly, we are going to start from the basic physical laws of airflow and use them to derive the shape of a wing.<sup id="fnref:fn18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn18">1</a></sup> Since we are using so few assumptions, the wing shape we come up with will be as fundamental as the physics of the air that swirls around it. This is pretty fundamental. In fact, if an alien species started building flying machines on another planet, they would probably converge on a similar shape.</p>

<h3 id="navier-stokes">Navier-Stokes</h3>

<p>We will begin this journey with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Navier-Stokes-equation">Navier-Stokes equation</a>, which sums up pretty much everything we know about fluid dynamics. It describes how tiny fluid parcels interact with their neighbors. The process of solving fluid dynamics problems comes down to writing out this equation and then deciding which terms we can safely ignore. In our case, we would like to simulate the flow of air through a wind tunnel and then use it to evaluate various wing shapes.</p>

<p>Since the pressure differences across a wind tunnel are small, one of the first assumptions we can make is that air is incompressible. This lets us use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow">incompressible form</a> of the Navier-Stokes equation:</p>

<p><span id="longEqnWithSmallScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} \\
~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span>
<span id="longEqnWithLargeScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} ~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span></p>

<p>Another term we can ignore is viscous diffusion. Viscous diffusion describes how fluid parcels distribute their momenta due to sticky interactions with their neighbors. We would say that a fluid with high viscosity is “thick”: common examples include molasses and motor oil. Even though air is much thinner, viscous interactions still cause a layer of slow-moving air to form along the surface of an airplane wing. However, we can ignore this boundary layer because its contribution to the aerodynamics of the wing is small compared to that of self-advection.</p>

<p>The final term we can ignore is the forces term, as there will be no forces on the air once it enters the wind tunnel. And so we are left with but a hair of the original Navier-Stokes hairball:</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection ("velocity follows itself")}}\]

<p>This simple expression describes the effects that really dominate wind tunnel physics. It says, intuitively, that “the change in velocity over time is due to the fact that velocity follows itself.” So the entire simulation comes down to two simple rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		• Rule 1: Velocity follows itself <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- <b>Rule 1: Velocity follows itself</b> -->
		• Rule 2: Volume is conserved <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>By alternating between these two rules, we can iteratively 1) move the system forward in time and 2) enforce conservation of volume and mass. In practice, we implement each rule as a separate function and then apply both functions to the system at every time step. This allows us to simulate, say, a gust of wind passing through the wind tunnel. But before we can direct this wind over a wing, we need to decide how to represent the wing itself.</p>

<h3 id="representing-the-wing">Representing the Wing</h3>

<div>
<p>The wing is an internal boundary, or occlusion, of the flow. A good way to represent an occlusion is with a mask of zeros and ones. But since the goal of our wind tunnel is to try out different wing shapes, we need our wing to be continuously deformable. So we will allow the mask to take on continuous values between zero and one, making it semi-permeable in proportion to its mask values. This lets us add semi-permeable obstructions to the wind tunnel as shown:</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.0</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.05.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.05</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.12.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.12</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.50.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.5</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_1.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 1.0</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="choosing-an-objective">Choosing an Objective</h3>

<p>Now we are at the point where we can simulate how air flows over arbitrary, semi-permeable shapes. But in order to determine which of these shapes makes a better wing, we still need to define a measure of performance. There are many qualities that one could look for in a good wing, but we will begin with the most obvious: it should convert horizontal air velocity into upward force as efficiently as possible. We can measure this ability using something called the lift-drag ratio where “lift” measures the upward force generated by the wing and “drag” measures the frictional forces between the air and the wing. Since “change in downward airflow” in the tunnel is proportional to the upward force on the wing, we can use it as a proxy for lift. Likewise, “change in rightward airflow” is a good proxy for the drag forces on the wing. With this in mind, we can write out the objective function as</p>

\[\max_{\theta} L/D\]

<p>where \(\theta\) represents some tunable parameters associated with the shape of the wing mask and \(L/D\) can be obtained using the initial and final wind velocities of the simulation according to</p>

\[\begin{align}
     L/D &amp;= \frac{\text{lift}}{\text{drag}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{\text{change in downward airflow}}{-\text{change in rightward airflow}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ -\big ( v_y(t)-v_y(0) \big )}{-\big ( v_x(t)-v_x(0) \big )}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ v_y(t)-v_y(0) }{ v_x(t)-v_x(0)}
\end{align}\]

<p>Solving this optimization problem will give us a wing shape that generates the most efficient lift possible. In other words, we new have the correct problem setup; what remains is to figure out how to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>

<div>
<p>We are going to solve this problem with gradient ascent. Gradient ascent is simple and easy to implement, but there is one important caveat: we need a way to efficiently compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the wing mask parameters. This involves differentiating through each step of the fluid simulation in turn – all of the way back to the initial conditions. This would be difficult to implement by hand, but fortunately there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a> which can perform this back-propagation of gradients automatically. We will use Autograd to compute the gradients of the mask parameters, move the mask parameters in that direction, and then repeat this process until the lift-drag ratio reaches a local maximum.</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<p>So let’s review. Our goal is to simulate a wind tunnel and use it to derive a wing shape. We began by writing down the general Navier-Stokes equation and eliminating irrelevant terms: all of them but self-advection. Next, we figured out how to represent a wing shape in the tunnel using a continuously-deformable occlusion. Finally, we wrote down an equation for what a good wing should do and discussed how to optimize it. Now it is time to put everything together in about two hundred lines of code and see what happens when we run it…</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/optimize_wing.png">
</p>

	<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/wing.png" onclick="toggleBasicWing()" id="basicWing">
</p></div>

<p>Sure enough, we get a beautiful little wing. Of all possible shapes, this is the very best one for creating efficient lift in our wind tunnel. This wing is definitely a toy solution since our simulation is coarse and not especially accurate. However, after making a few simple improvements we would be able to design real airplane wings this way. We would just need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate in 3D instead of 2D</li>
  <li>Use a mesh parameterization instead of a grid</li>
  <li>Make the flow laminar and compressible</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from these improvements, the overall principle is much the same. In both cases, we write down some words and symbols, turn them into code, and then use the code to shape our wing.<sup id="fnref:fn14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn14">2</a></sup> The fact that we can do all of this without ever building a physical wing makes it feel a bit like magic. But this process really works, for when we <a href="http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson-cincin-pm.pdf#page=36">put these wings on airplanes</a> and trust them with our lives, they carry us safely to our destinations.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn17">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Just like the real wind tunnels of the twentieth century, these simulated wind tunnels need to go through lots of debugging before we can trust them. In fact, while building this demo we discovered a number of ways that things can go wrong. Here are some of the most amusing failure cases:</p>

<p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/sim_bloopers.png">
</p>

<p>Several of these wings are just plain dreadful. But others seem reasonable, if unexpected. The two-wing solution is particularly amusing. We did not intend for this “biplane” solution to occur, and yet it is a completely viable way of solving the objective we wrote down. One advantage to keeping the problem setup so …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" alt="" width="652" height="447" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em> <a href="https://slouchingtowardsthatcham.com/2019/07/10/social-media-for-influencers-organic-reach/">Organic reach in social media is going down and will continue to do so.</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>

        <p>Web browsers are the most common tool nowadays. Therefore, they are most popular target for any kind of bad people: malware authors, attackers and others.</p>
<p>Further, there is also a huge interest from companies to get data from users. They want to get all kinds of data. And since web browsers are the most common tools, the most obvious way is to cooperate with browser manufacturers to get data.</p>
<p>So far, this are the facts which are known to most privacy concerned people. But since no one can avoid using a browser, most are willing to do a compromise. But which browser does leak the fewest data of all?
Method</p>
<p>The premise was, that the browser is free software (open source), with one exception (Vivaldi).  Although some proprietary browsers do a good job from a pure technical perspective, most security and privacy experts do agree, that using free and open source software  is essential for secure and privacy-aware networking.</p>
<p>The testing was done on Debian 10 on amd64 with some packages from Antix and  MX Linux.</p>
<p>The following browsers were tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox ESR 78.3.0</li>
<li>Midori 1.1.4 (Electron version)</li>
<li>Vivaldi   3.4.2066</li>
<li>Brave 1.15.72</li>
<li>Epiphany  3.32.1.2</li>
</ul>
<p>The method itself was relatively simple. I created a new user with an empty home directory, so there were no cache or plugins. Every browser was started without any pre-configuration or cache.</p>
<p>At the same time tcpdump was running. I disabled IPv6 for simpleness. I made sure no other network capable program was active and made tcpdump listen to the outgoing network interface.</p>
<p>I started the browser, kept it open for about 10 seconds without any interaction or usage and then closed it. After that I filtered out the http and https traffic and DNS-Queries  from the results. And here they are:</p>

The Lost Chapter<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Recovered conversations from 2004 shine new light on Facebook's origins.</span></p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authoritas-Students-Admissions-Founding-Facebook/dp/1606690000/ref=ed_oe_h"><img src="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/authoritas/en_US/title.gif"></a></p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> See the January 2019 <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html" target="_new">Facebook, Inc. Reality Check report on PlainSite</a>, as well as my <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/d434d37f-c020-44b4-bda8-11bbad29ac58" target="_new">June 2019 testimony before UK Parliament's DCMS Sub-Committee on Disinformation</a>.</p><p>Chapter 30: The Other Folder</p><p><b>2003: Cambridge, Massachusetts</b></p><p>In college, my computer's filing system was relatively straightforward: I had a folder for each year of school, and within each of those folders there were additional folders for each course I was taking. For everything else—birthday cards for my family, funny or strange conversations with friends, documents from the College administration, and summer housing—there was the "Other" folder.</p><p>So it happened that in my junior year of college, I came across the web site of one of the many finals clubs on campus, the Fly Club. I wasn't even close to being a member of any of the clubs, but the Fly Club was of particular interest because it effectively sat on my front lawn, directly in front of Lowell House, where I'd walk back and forth in front of it to go to class every day, several times a day, without ever having seen the inside. (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Fly+Club,+Cambridge,+MA+02138&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.371103,-71.118104&amp;spn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;sll=42.371031,-71.118166&amp;sspn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;t=h&amp;hq=The+Fly+Club,&amp;hnear=Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A)" target="_new">It's still there</a>.)</p><p>At the time, the Fly's web site had a minor glitch. As an exclusive social club open only to the elite of the elite, there wasn't much for the "average" visitor such as myself to do. On the home page, members could sign in, while everyone else could simply stare at a large picture of the building that they were politely denied access to. I wasn't interested in gaining access so much as I was curious why access was denied in the first place. But even the most exclusive buildings have back doors.</p><p>Asking my web browser to display the address of the image of the building revealed that it was unsurprisingly in the /images folder. And asking my web browser to see if there was anything else in that folder revealed that there was: a PDF comprising a directory of the Club's still-living members dating back to 1923.</p><p>I thought about it for a while, and then decided to e-mail someone I knew in the Club to inform him of the problem and to offer my services in fixing it. He replied thanking me, and that was the last I heard about it. Though I did not deliberately save the PDF to my hard drive at first, eventually I did, afraid that without it, there would be no proof that I had ever found the problem in the first place, should the matter ever come up again. I saved the file to my Other folder, and there it sat for nine years.</p><p><b>2012: Palo Alto, California</b></p><p>Quora is a Silicon Valley startup, founded by Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever, both so-called Facebook veterans (a phrase that actual veterans might find laughable). Adam was Facebook's founding CTO after graduating from CalTech, and Charlie was one of Facebook's early employees after graduating from Harvard. Both are smart, down-to-earth, driven, and relatively quiet guys. Both managed to generate an enormous amount of investor, media, and user interest for Quora, though most of the users today still seem to be confined to Silicon Valley types (which should make it unsurprising that I have an account). And both founders are now at the center of a growing mystery after Adam unilaterally announced on September 11, 2012 that Charlie would no longer be involved in his day-to-day role at the company.</p><p>Several articles, none of them particularly insightful, were written about this minor drama. One of them mentioned that while at Harvard, Charlie had been the President of the Fly Club, which got me wondering—was that really true? So I began to think whether I might be able to answer the question for myself without the confounding factors of rumor and speculation. With a few clicks, I decompressed my Other folder from my junior year of college, and found the Fly Club's 2001 PDF. It confirmed that Charlie was indeed a member of the Club in 2001. And then I noticed some other files—several dated files, all ending with "zuckerberg.html."</p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="PDF"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new">The Complete Timeline</a></p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040108.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040409.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040420.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040524.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040602.zuckerberg.html</a></p><p>•</p><p>It turns out that my Other folder contained some of the most important legal evidence regarding the origins of Facebook, Inc. that I had been trying to find for years, but without much success. I had already scoured the folders I created for the Student Entrepreneurship Council and come up with a number of the AOL Instant Messenger conversations that I had with Mark, but not all of them, and not the most revealing ones. I had also checked my "Aaron" folder, which had another sub-folder for Instant Messenger conversations, as well as the large hierarchy of folders containing all of Think Computer Corporation's data, which had even more conversations, but none with Mark. The conversations I remembered having, but could not recall the exact details of, were nowhere to be found, at least until September 12, 2012.</p><p>What Mark and I talked about in the months before and after Facebook's launch is remarkably relevant both for its historical and present value. There is almost as much significance in what was not said as what was.</p><p>For starters, it's striking how different the context is between the way these conversations portray the beginning of Facebook, and how the opening scenes of The Social Network portray the beginning of Facebook. Long after Mark's angry blog posts that spawned Facemash, there was no talk of girlfriends or breakups, and no talk of finals clubs (even though one indirectly led me back to the conversations themselves). In other words, as we already knew, Ben Mezrich <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=71">invented material out of whole cloth</a> for his book (upon which the movie was based), and <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=76">profited enormously</a> from calling it "non-fiction." He did so mostly at the expense of Mark's high school friend (and later, Quora co-founder) Adam D'Angelo and myself. When the book and then the movie came out, only Adam had Facebook's imprimatur to protect his reputation.</p><p>Rather, the real key to Mark's interest in social networking can be found in the first ten lines of our first conversation: AIM screennames. Using Adam's BuddyZoo, which allowed users to determine their connections to other AIM users, Mark determined the shortest path between his screenname and mine. But we each independently realized that AIM was startlingly deficient insofar as the software encouraged users to customize their profiles, and then limited them from doing so. There was far more potential than what AIM allowed in its small text box, which is why I had immediately added an AIM screenname field to my Facebook along with a field for cell phone number, and Mark was thinking about building the exact same thing—only with Adam's BuddyZoo built in.</p><p>It's also remarkable just how close Mark and I seemed at the beginning, even after just meeting each other, which might help explain why I felt so deeply wounded in the ensuing months and years. Mark repeatedly requested, and I repeatedly offered, help with his (and even Adam's) project; after all, he didn't know much about computer hardware, and he knew almost nothing about business or legal matters. This is not to say that he wasn't smart, because he was certainly a quick learner. Yet almost from the outset, despite acting in an otherwise friendly manner, Mark determined not that he wanted to help me in return, but that he wanted to compete with me.</p><p>Serious competition between friends, in my experience, never works well, and always ends badly. Someone is bound to get hurt. In this case that person was obviously me. Mark's brand of competition, though, was more pernicious than your average sort. Rather than building a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook, he built a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook (as he himself admitted) that he called, without ever informing me of his intent to do so, The Facebook. It wasn't "Mark's Facebook." It wasn't "A Facebook." It was "The Facebook." As the operator of another product that people were already calling the exact same thing, that automatically put me on the defensive, because his choice of a generic name necessarily implied uniqueness and stature. His eagerness to take his work to <i>The Crimson</i> to be broadcast campuswide, made this seemingly minor problem a major one, especially when other campus newspapers nationwide, and then mainstream newspapers, picked up the story.</p><p>For a college student in 2003, I understood an awful lot about trademarks, including the general reasons why one could not trademark a generic term. I had spent five years fighting two companies over the right to name my company Think Computer—a battle I eventually won in 2004. But it came at a great expense in terms of both time and money, and I was shocked that Mark would trample on the name of someone he had just met in the dining hall over dinner three days before. It was an expense I simply could not afford all over again (unlike the Winklevoss twins, my father did not have millions of dollars of disposable income), besides which I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of getting into a legal battle with another student who apparently looked up to me and sat next to me in a Computer Science independent study. So I asked Mark about it after class one day. He denied doing anything wrong, acting wounded by the question instead. Either he was faking it, or he truly didn't understand what he was doing. Perhaps it was a little of both.</p><p>It had already been clear from our first bite of rubber chicken in Kirkland House that there were a lot of things Mark didn't understand, aside from intellectual property. He didn't understand how to speak like a mature person his age. He didn't understand why his earlier creation, Facemash, might have offended people (including me). He didn't really understand why anyone would be interested in a site as useful as houseSYSTEM. And he shockingly did not understand why information …</p></div></div>

  <p>It’s good to understand the TPS (transaction per second) of a service. But sometimes we only have TPM (transaction per minute) metrics. It may because we don’t have TPS metric at all since it needs resources to compute, or it has been deleted because storing all the historical per second metrics needs a lot of storage space. So we need to estimate TPS from TPM (or even longer time period, which the method below also applies). It’s not hard to get an average TPS from TPM: just divide TPM by 60. However, because the database and the dependency services have a limit on how many concurrent requests it can handle, we also need to understand what’s the max TPS. In this article, we will explore how to do that.</p>

<p>We have an assumption before we go to the solution: we assume that in the time period of one minute, the requests to the service has the same probability to happen at any time. In another word, the requests are independently of the time since last request. This means the time of the requests is a uniform distribution. This is a reasonable assumption: though most services has peak requests during a day, it tends to be distributed evenly in a short period like one minute,. We need to notice that the equal of probability doesn’t mean all the requests <strong>will</strong> arrive evenly in the minute, otherwise max TPS will be the same as average TPS.</p>

<p>With this assumption in mind, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a> to solve this problem. The probability of how many times the event occurs in the interval of time can be solved by this:</p>

<p><span>\(P(TPS=k) =  \frac{\lambda^k e^{-k}}{k!}\)</span></p>

<p><span>\(k\)</span> means how many times the event happens in the interval of time. <span>\(\lambda\)</span> means the average of times that the event will occur in the interval.</p>

<p>In our case, the interval of time is 1 second. So <span>\(\lambda\)<span> is the average TPS: <span>\(TPM / 60\)</span>. And <span>\(P(k)\)</span> means the probability of the TPS during this minute.</span></span></p>

<p>So we have the probability of the TPS. But what we want is the max TPS. If we want to know what’s the probability of max TPS equals n, we can add all the probabilities of TPS under n:</p>

<p><span>\(P(max TPS = n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} P(TPS=k) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-k}}{k!}\)</span></p>

<p>Then we can draw a graph of this function and select n that makes the probability almost to 1. I recommend <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> to draw the graph. Though it needs paid version to show a more clear graph, the free version is enough for our use case.</p>

<p>Let’s give an example. Suppose we find our max TPM during peak time is 1200, then the average TPS during that minute is 200, which means <span>\(\lambda = 200\)</span>. Then we can draw a graph of <span>\(P(max TPS=n)\)</span> with <span>\(\lambda = 200\)</span>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.binwang.me/static/images/2020-10-18-How-to-Estimate-max-TPS-from-TPM/p-lambda-200.png" alt="p-lambda-200"></p>

<p>From the graph, we can see a max TPS of 260 is a safety choice. And in this minute, about 50% of the chance that the TPS will above the average TPS 200.</p>

<p>Sometimes the dependency has a throttling mechanism. It may has a target throttling configuration as TPS, but actually count the throttling number by sub-second metrics like transactions per 100ms. (Ideally this shouldn’t be the case but sometimes that happens and we don’t always have control over dependency services). In this case, we need to count max transactions per 100ms. Which <span>\(\lambda = 20\)</span>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.binwang.me/static/images/2020-10-18-How-to-Estimate-max-TPS-from-TPM/p-lambda-20.png" alt="p-lambda-20"></p>

<p>From the graph, we can see max transactions per 100ms would be more like 36. And when we provide a target throttling TPS, we should multiply this by 10 which is 360, a lot higher than 260.</p>

<p>The calculation above also applies when it count throttling number independently on multiple hosts. (Again, it should have a better throttling counting mechanism). For example, if the dependency service has 10 hosts and it chooses random host to handle the request, then we should count max TPS per host. Which <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is also 20 and target TPS configuration should be 360 instead of 260.</p>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Eta Redux</strong></p>

As such, in this article, unless states otherwise references to the GPL and LGPL are references to version 2.0 of the GPL and version 2.1 of the LGPL.

The licenses refer to “compiling”, “linking” and “header files”, features of the C programming </span></span><span>languages</span><span><span> which may not be present in other languages that are not traditionally compiled. Similarly, the licenses do not expressly include provisions relating to features of object-oriented programming languages.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: In contrast, version 3.0 of the LGPL does relate to features of object oriented languages. For example, the definition of “Application” in that license discusses the effect of defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library."><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">2</a></span></span></span><span><span> Do the GNU licenses work as intended when applied in these other contexts? </span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The Free Software Foundation has strongly asserted that the LGPL may be applied to all known programming languages. See David Turner, The LGPL and Java, available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.html (stating that “FSF’s position has remained constant throughout: the LGPL works as intended with all known programming languages, including Java.”). "><a href="#ftn3" id="body_ftn3">3</a></span></span></span><span><span> This article analy</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>es the Lisp </span></span><span><span>Lesser General Public License (colloquially and here referred to as the “</span></span><span><span>LLGPL</span></span><span><span>”), a specific attempt to apply the LGPL to a language with a programming paradigm and method of </span></span><span><span>building and distributing programs that traditionally differs from the approach of C.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: In a somewhat ironic twist, the history of the GNU licenses began with Richard Stallman’s distribution of Emacs, a text-editing program written in Lisp. Stallman initially distributed Emacs under the Emacs General Public License, out of which grew the first version of the General Public License. For an early history of the GNU licenses, see Chapter 2 of Glyn Moody, Rebel Code (2002)."><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">4</a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p><p><span><span>Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages still in use. Lisp was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The language was first implemented when one of McCarthy’s graduate students hand-compiled the Lisp </span></span><span><span>eval</span></span><span><span> function into machine code, and created the first Lisp interpreter. Following in this history, while implementations of Lisp can allow for the compilation and distribution of executables, Lisp was traditionally developed and distributed as an interpreted rather than a compiled language. Lisp was closely connected to research in the field of artificial intelligence, and the popularity of the language declined in the late 1980s together with interest in that field. Nevertheless, Lisp seems to have enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence in recent years, and currently there are several open source and commercial implementations of the language.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Open source programs are not frequently written in Lisp.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: According to Black Duck, Lisp is not one of the top fifteen languages used in open source projects. See http://www.blackducksoftware.com/osrc/data/projects/. C is the most popular language, used in 44.95% of releases of open source projects. For a not-up-to date list of some commercial software projects in Lisp, see http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/lisp-companies/."><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">5</a></span></span></span><span><span> Nevertheless, certain features of Lisp have inspired a broader family of “dynamic languages” that can be considered to include popular languages such as PHP or Python. As with Lisp, for example, those languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled into executables. As such, programs written in those languages will also generally require the distribution of an interpreter together with the application. To the extent the LLGPL</span></span><span><span>'s</span></span><span><span> claim that the GNU licenses are not appropriate for Lisp is justified, the suitability of the GNU licenses for these other languages will also be implicated.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This article presents a close reading of the LLGPL license. In analy</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ing the license, this article attempts to understand whether, as the LLGPL claims, another document is necessary to apply the LGPL to the Lisp context. In addition, this article attempts to understand whether the LLGPL succeeds in its stated goal of translating the LGPL to the Lisp context or whether, in making the transition, the LLGPL moves away from the requirements and philosophical underpinnings of the LGPL. Before concluding, this article briefly discusses some issues raised by Lisp that were not expressly addressed by the LLGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Aside from the LLGPL, there are a number of other licenses that have been drafted to apply to specific programming languages. For example, PHP is distributed under a permissive license similar to the BSD. See http://www.php.net/license/index.php#code-lic. Python is also distributed under a permissive license. See http://docs.python.org/2/license.html. These licenses are generic and do not have any technical provisions that apply to features of specific languages. A number of other licenses contain provisions expressly adapted for particular programming languages. For example, the GNAT Modified General Public License is a version of the GPL which has been adapted for the “generic” feature of the Ada programming language. See http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gnat-gpl-edition/faq/. In addition, the Falcon Programming Language License is “specifically designed around the concept of an open source scripting language engine.” See http://www.falconpl.org/index.ftd?page_id=licensing. An analysis of these latter two licenses is beyond the scope of this article."><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">6</a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p><p><span><span>The LLGPL was authored by Franz, Inc. (“</span></span><span><span>Franz</span></span><span><span>”), a leading commercial Lisp vendor based in </span></span><span><span>California. Franz is the corporate developer of “Allegro Common Lisp”, one of several commercial implementations of the “ANSI Common Lisp” standard.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Commercial implementations of Lisp also includes LispWorks. Open source implementations of Lisp include Steel Bank Common Lisp, which is licensed under BSD-style licenses and also includes code in the public domain (See http://www.sbcl.org/history.html), GNU Common Lisp, available under the LGPL (See http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gcl), and GNU Clisp, available under the GPL (See http://www.clisp.org/). "><a href="#ftn7" id="body_ftn7">7</a></span></span></span><span><span> The ANSI Common Lisp </span></span><span><span>standard was developed in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify the several dialects of the language.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See the history of Lisp at http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf"><a href="#ftn8" id="body_ftn8">8</a></span></span></span><span><span> Franz initially began distributing Allegro Common Lisp in 1986, and authored the LLGPL in 2000. Franz has shown a commitment to the open source development of software, and has licensed a number of open source software projects under the terms of the LLGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See http://opensource.franz.com/"><a href="#ftn9" id="body_ftn9">9</a></span></span></span><span><span> Unfortunately, there is a dearth of commentary regarding the interpretation of the LLGPL. As such, and as the provisions of the license are not always completely clear, the application of the LLGPL to software may not always be completely straightforward.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The LLGPL is a short document, consisting of five not-lengthy paragraphs, and by its terms is intended to be read as a “preamble” to the LGPL.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The concept of presenting the LLGPL as a preamble to the GNU license seems to be inspired by the structure of the LGPL itself, which begins with a preamble that explains the goals of the license."><a href="#ftn10" id="body_ftn10">10</a></span></span></span><span><span> Generally, the LGPL permits proprietary applications to be combined and distributed with LGPL-licensed libraries, and does not require that the source code of the proprietary application be disclosed. This is in contrast to the stronger “copyleft” requirements of the GPL, which generally requires that all works “based on” a GPL-licensed work also be distributed under the same license terms. The LLGPL is intended to adapt the weaker copyleft provisions of the LGPL to the Lisp setting. In the words of the first paragraph of the LLGPL, the “LGPL uses terminology more appropriate for a program written in C than one written in Lisp” and, as such, some “clarifications” are necessary to apply the LGPL in the Lisp context. </span></span></p><p><span><span>The first paragraph of the LLGPL implies that the application of the LLGPL results in licensing terms that are not very different than the LGPL itself, even though they have been translated to the Lisp context.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: On its website, Franz itself provides a somewhat more ambiguous description of the LLGPL, stating that the document is a “new license” which is intended to take the special features of dynamic programming languages into consideration. See http://opensource.franz.com/"><a href="#ftn11" id="body_ftn11">11</a></span></span></span><span><span> Even so, several provisions of the LLGPL seem to belie this understanding of the license. For example, the LLGPL provides that a “Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application is necessarily a ‘work based on the Library’ it contains.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See the last sentence of the second paragraph of the LLGPL."><a href="#ftn12" id="body_ftn12">12</a></span></span></span><span><span> In contrast, the LGPL expressly provides that a work containing portions of the Library should be considered a derivative work of the Library under copyright law, and a “work based on the Library” under the LGPL.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: For example, the definition of “Library” in the LGPL provides that a “work based on the Library” includes a “work containing the Library or a portion of it. Similarly, section 5 of the LGPL provides that “linking a ‘work that uses the Library’ with the Library creates … a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library).”"><a href="#ftn13" id="body_ftn13">13</a></span></span></span><span><span> The clause in the LLGPL seems to contradict express provisions of the LGPL. Unfortunately, the LLGPL does not explain the motivation for making this fundamental change in the terms of the LGPL. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Other clauses of the LLGPL also seem to diverge from the provisions of the LGPL. For example, the LLGPL provides that “[i]t is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without that proprietary code present.”</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: See first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the LLGPL."><a href="#ftn14" id="body_ftn14">14</a></span></span></span><span><span> This seems to restrict a user’s ability to modify the licensed work. Interpreting this sentence in light of the </span></span><span><span>LGPL is quite difficult, as Section 2 of the LGPL expressly provides a user of the Library with the right to modify and copy the Library, without any requirement to ensure that it can still run without those modifications.</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: Indeed, one of the core freedoms advocated by the Free Software Foundation is the freedom to modify software. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html. The LGPL also evidences a similar concern that a modified Library should be able to operate even without the application that it is linked with. See Section 2(d) of the LGPL. Even so, that concern is with regard to the use of the licensed work when distributed to third parties, but the literal reading of the LLGPL provides no suggestion that it should be read as anything but a restriction of a user’s right to modify the program, regardless of whether the modified version is distributed to third parties. In addition, the LGPL only requires that users make a “good faith effort” to ensure the operation of the modified library. In contrast, the LLGPL’s requirement is formulated as an absolute requirement."><a href="#ftn15" id="body_ftn15">15</a></span></span></span><span><span> Again, the LLGPL does not describe the reasons for </span></span><span><span>adding this requirement to the provisions of the LGPL.</span></span></p><p>These examples demonstrate that it is difficult to reconcile certain provisions of the LLGPL with the original GNU license. Indeed, this article shows that the LLGPL does clarify certain provisions of the LGPL in the Lisp setting, but also substantially modifies the provisions of the original license. Unfortunately, the LLGPL is frequently not explicit regarding whether a specific provision should be seen as a “translation” to the Lisp context or as an intentional change in the licensing terms of the LGPL. Furthermore, the LLGPL does not always explain its motivation for making certain clarifications or changes, and this can make it difficult to interpret and apply the license. </p><p>Several provisions of the LLGPL seem to be motivated by an attempt to clarify the provisions of the LGPL in the Lisp setting. For example, the second paragraph of the LLGPL changes several definitions of the LGPL, such as the definitions of “library”, “function” and “data”, making them more amenable to the Lisp context. The second paragraph reads in full:</p><p>A “Library” in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of compilation of source code or built with some other mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in the most general way to include, in addition, methods and unnamed functions. Lisp “data” is also a general term that includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp classes. A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application is necessarily a “work based on the Library” it contains. &nbsp;</p><p>These revised and generali<span>s</span>ed definitions are to some extent useful in clarifying LGPL terminology for Lisp. At the same time, however, the revisions appear to focus on certain aspects of the technical distinctiveness of Lisp which would not seem to materially affect the interpretation of the LGPL. </p><p><span><span>For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph provides that “[a] ‘Library’ in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign modules.”</span></span><a name="_Ref334504046"><span><span><span title="Footnote: A “foreign module”, according to the LLGPL, is “object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable”. Briefly, Lisp data types often differ from data types in other languages. As such, Lisp requires a “foreign function interface” in order to link code written in a different language. See generally Peter Seibel, Practical Common Lisp, 467 (2005). The existence of foreign modules and the need for a “foreign function interface” is not unique to Lisp. For example, the “Java Native Interface” enables a Java Virtual Machine to invoke (and be invoked by) the native code of libraries and applications written in other languages. The Perl XS interface also allows Perl to use C libraries. The Python extension module API allows the calling of library functions and system calls."></span></span></span></a><a href="#ftn16" id="body_ftn16">16</a><span><span> The purpose of this definition seems to be </span></span><span><span>the subtle modification of the definition of a “library” (not capitali</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ed)</span></span><span><span><span title="Footnote: The LGPL contains a definition of “library” (not capitalised) and “Library” (capitalised). The former provides a generic description of a software library, while the latter refers to the specific work licensed under the LGPL. The need for the former generic definition of a software library is not clear in the document and, indeed, version 3 of the LGPL omits this generic definition. In version 3 of the LGPL, a “Library” simply means a “covered work governed by this License.”"><a href="#ftn17" id="body_ftn17">17</a></span></span></span><span><span> in the LGPL, which provides that a library means “a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to </span></span><span><span>form …</span></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi All! Welcome back to part 11 of our <strong>Blazor 2d Gamedev </strong>series. Today we’re going to refactor and improve the code responsible for <strong>loading assets</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-10-the-scene-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last time </a>we talked about <strong>Scene Graphs</strong> and how they can help us managing our Game Entities. We used the classic solar system example, with every planet represented by its own asset, loaded separately.</p><p>Our goal now is to have a centralized asset loading mechanism and avoid the hassle of having to reference all our assets in a Blazor page or component. Basically, we’ll be moving from this</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet1.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet2.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet3.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet4.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet5.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;
&lt;Spritesheet Source="assets/planet6.json" OnModelLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;</pre><p>to something much more simple:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;Assets Source="assets/assets.json" OnLoaded="@OnAssetsLoaded" /&gt;</pre><p>Nice, isn’t it?</p><p>The idea is quite simple actually: instead of referencing each asset one by one (let it be a sprite, sound, animation, whatever), we’re going to load a <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/wwwroot/assets/assets.json" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single JSON file </a>containing the assets list along with its type:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="json" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[
  {
    "path": "assets/enemyRed1.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  },
  {
    "path": "assets/meteorBrown_big1.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  },
  {
    "path": "assets/playerShip2_green.png",
    "type": "sprite"
  }
]</pre><p>At this point, all we have to do is implement a <strong>Blazor Component</strong> that can parse this data, download the files and inject them into our Game. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Shared/Assets.razor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full code here</a>, but let’s see the gist:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
	var items = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;AssetData[]&gt;(this.Source);

	foreach (var item in items)
	{
		IAsset asset = null;
		if (item.type == "sprite")
			asset = await this.AssetsResolver.Load&lt;Sprite&gt;(item.path);

		if (null != asset)
			_items.Add(new Tuple&lt;IAsset, AssetData&gt;(asset, item));
	}

	await this.OnLoaded.InvokeAsync(this);
}</pre><p>Here we download the file pointed by the <em><strong>Source</strong> </em>property, loop over each item and use the <strong><em>AssetResolver</em></strong> instance to load it given the type. In our browser’s network tab we would see something like this:</p><div><figure><img width="598" height="378" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=598%2C378&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=598%2C378&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/assets-loading.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p> Once loaded, the items will be rendered into the page in a simple loop:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;div class="assets"&gt;
    @foreach (var item in _items)
    {
        // render item by type
    }
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/AssetsResolver.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>AssetsResolver</strong> class </a>will basically serve two purposes: loading the assets from the server and, well, <em>resolve</em> them when we need during the game (more on this later). Each asset type has to be registered in the <strong><a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Composition Root</a></strong>. An <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/Loaders/AssetLoaderFactory.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>AssetLoaderFactory</strong></em> </a>will be leveraged to do the matching type/loader:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AssetLoaderFactory : IAssetLoaderFactory
{
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; _loaders;

	public AssetLoaderFactory()
	{
		_loaders = new Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt;();
	}

	public void Register&lt;TA&gt;(IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt; loader) where TA : IAsset
	{
		var type = typeof(TA);
		if (!_loaders.ContainsKey(type)) _loaders.Add(type, null);
		_loaders[type] = loader;
	}

	public IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt; Get&lt;TA&gt;() where TA : IAsset
	{
		var type = typeof(TA);
		if(!_loaders.ContainsKey(type))
			throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException($"invalid asset type: {type.FullName}");

		return _loaders[type] as IAssetLoader&lt;TA&gt;;
	}
}</pre><p>In our demo we will have a single Asset Loader implementation, <strong><a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example10/Core/Assets/Loaders/SpriteAssetLoader.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpriteAssetLoader</a></strong>:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class SpriteAssetLoader : IAssetLoader&lt;Sprite&gt;
{
	private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
	private readonly ILogger&lt;SpriteAssetLoader&gt; _logger;

	public SpriteAssetLoader(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger&lt;SpriteAssetLoader&gt; logger)
	{
		_httpClient = httpClient;
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public async ValueTask&lt;Sprite&gt; Load(string path)
	{
		_logger.LogInformation($"loading sprite from path: {path}");

		var bytes = await _httpClient.GetByteArrayAsync(path);
		await using var stream = new MemoryStream(bytes);
		using var image = await SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image.LoadAsync(stream);
		var size = new Size(image.Width, image.Height);

		var elementRef = new ElementReference(Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
		return new Sprite(path, elementRef, size, bytes, ImageFormatUtils.FromPath(path));
	}
}</pre><p>We first download the image from the server into a stream and then load it in memory. I’m using <strong><a href="https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ImageSharp </a></strong>for now as seems to be the only library at the moment to work in WebAssembly. I was evaluating <strong><a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkiaSharp </a></strong>as well, but when I wrote the sample it was still <a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/1194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not working properly</a>.</p><h4>The reason why we need to parse the image data is that we need some useful info, like width and height. Yes, we could add those as attributes elsewhere, but we might also want to do some processing, like changing contrast/saturation and so on.</h4><p>So, this covers the loading part. Now with the easy part: using the assets in our Game. The code is not that different from last time: all we have to do is initialize our Scene Graph and populate it with Game Objects:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var player = new GameObject();

player.Components.Add&lt;TransformComponent&gt;();

var playerSpriteRenderer = player.Components.Add&lt;SpriteRenderComponent&gt;();
playerSpriteRenderer.Sprite = AssetsResolver.Get&lt;Sprite&gt;("assets/playerShip2_green.png");

SceneGraph.Root.AddChild(player);</pre><p>Aaaand we’re done! The<a href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> final result </a>is going to look like more or less like this:</p><div><figure><img width="600" height="330" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20600%20330%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blazor-assets-loading.gif?resize=600%2C330&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p>This is the last article of the Series. I really enjoyed writing again about gamedev stuff and seems a lot of people liked the articles. It also contributed to my <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003878?fullName=Davide%20Guida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MVP award</a>, so that’s definitely a plus 🙂</p><p>I’ll probably add something more in the not-so-distant future, who knows. For now, thank you very much for reading, see you next time!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6054437144226106686" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>From the moment&nbsp;we log onto the internet, we get bombarded with dozens, if not hundreds of digital ads. Ads for shoes, shirts, vacations, productivity tools, medicine, political campaigns, mortgages, even ads for next generation military helicopters, <a href="http://worlddefenseshow.com/">weapons conferences</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2020/06/the-digital-battlespace">“digital battlespace” management</a>, and <a href="http://pnclassaction.com/">class action lawsuits</a>.
</p><p>A <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/02/internet-users-spend-more-than-a-quarter-of-their-lives-online.html">2019 report</a> found that the average internet user spends more than a quarter of their life (nearly seven hours per day) on the internet, through a combination of mobile, desktop, and other devices at work and at home. A typical user might see several <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/how-many-websites-do-you-visit-each-day/">dozen to several thousand</a> web pages per day. Given how much time we spend staring at computer or smartphone screens, it is no surprise that advertisers devote much of their efforts to getting a piece of our attention through said screens.</p><p>So how many ads does a typical internet user see per day? Estimates vary greatly, with some clocking in at <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/">20,000 per day.</a> One might question what these companies are getting out of bombarding users with so many ads. After all, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/brain-memory-magic-number/story?id=9189664">psychology experiments</a> have shown that our short-term memory can hold only a limited number of separate items. The average is about 7 items, plus or minus 2, depending on the context and individual. There is also the issue of relevance - more than <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/new-study-has-ad-blocking-peaked/">half of online </a>users find that the online ads they see are irrelevant. This has been partly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/18/the-cost-performance-paradox-of-modern-digital-marketing/#200ee9e82a9c">attributed</a> to problems with inaccurate audience targeting data.</p><p>I decided to conduct an exploratory experiment and monitor how many Google display and banner ads I saw over the course of a single month of browsing activity. I used the <a href="https://adalytics.io/">Adalytics browser extension</a> to keep track of all my ad data to determine:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How many different advertisers are paying for ads to get my attention?&nbsp;</li><li>What types of ads do I see most often?&nbsp;</li><li>What proportion of the ads I saw were relevant or useful to me?</li></ul><h2>How many different ads did I see?</h2><p>Over the course of one month in 2020, I saw a total 4,975 ads across the 35 different websites I visited. Of these 4,975 ads, there were 397 unique advertisement sponsors.
</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/GFrlzaKOjOsSUQfE.png" alt="top-ads-barchart.png"></p><p><i>How many times did I see an ad from a particular advertiser?</i></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/HSYRJBmnMukLbOcm.png" alt="top-ads-wordcloud.png"></p><p><i>Word cloud of advertisers whose ads I saw most frequently</i></p><h2>One advertiser showed me their ads over 2,000 times within the course of one month</h2><p>I was surprised by the large number of ads I got from the online lending marketplace LendingTree. Almost 40% of the ads I saw were from their company, for a grand total of 2,081 ads. Upon closer inspection, I realized that I had been reading an article on a statistics website and left the browser tab open for a day (but not in view). This particular website would unload and load new ads from Google and Pubmatic’s ad networks every 15-20 seconds - an ‘interesting’ practice that allows a publisher like the website displaying this LendingTree ad to garner a larger number of ad impressions (and revenue) per each site visit. This practice wastes a user’s network data and can also slow down browser performance.This situation illustrates a broader phenomenon - the AdChoices program was created partially in response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taking a closer look at the digital advertising industry in 2009. The resulting initiative was designed as a self-regulatory mechanism by the adtech platforms, but those platforms may have little financial interest in creating tools that enable users to reduce how many irrelevant ads they are shown. It is therefore unsurprising that <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/insights-attitude-towards-advertising-use-ad-blocking/">eliminating irrelevant ads</a> has become one of the top drivers of ad blocker adoption.</p><p>A recent r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/ir3247/if_the_same_ad_is_served_on_a_given_webpage_500/">Ad Operations</a> discussion confirmed that LendingTree most likely is getting charged for this multitude of ‘unseen’ impressions. Advertisers can utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_capping">frequency capping</a> to reduce the number of times a website visitor is shown the same ad and blacklist websites that inflate their impression counts through such means.</p><p>Disregarding this one problematic website, LendingTree was still the dominant purveyor of ads to my browser - 162 distinct impression loads. I discussed in another blog post how the Digital Advertising Alliance (which includes Google) created a self-regulatory initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices">AdChoices</a>, which in theory allows consumers to opt-out of seeing a specific ad multiple times by clicking on a blue triangle icon in the top right corner of an ad iframe. However, I showed in that exploratory analysis that a majority of ads do not include the AdChoices icon within their iframes, thus preventing users from opting out of seeing a specific ad unless they install an ad blocker. At the time this analysis was conducted, a majority of LendingTree’s ads that were observed neither included the AdChoices icon nor provided an opt-out mechanism upon clicking. In the latter case, the Blue AdChoices icon would simply take me to a <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762">Google Ads FAQ</a> that talks about Google’s Ad Personalization. At the time this blog post was written, I noticed that some of LendingTree’s ad do include a seemingly functional AdChoices icon that lets you opt-out of seeing their ads - the only problem is, after clicking this button and navigating to a new page, I would still see the same Lending Tree ads. Therefore, there was no way for me to indicate that I was not interested in LendingTree’s ads for the 2000th time, short of tweeting at their Marketing Team. (I will update this blog post if we get a response.)</p><h2>Breakdown of ads by category</h2><p>I used the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/">Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Content Taxonomy</a> to categorize each ad I was shown and see what types of ads were most common. Categorizing the 397 unique advertisements showed 27 different IAB categories represented in this sample. Of these, “Technology &amp; Computing” ads were the most common, while “Shopping” and “Food &amp; Drink” were surprisingly under-represented in terms of the number of distinct advertisers.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/kGIMdiYyuoYKRLJg.png" alt="ads-by-category.png"></p><p><i>Pie chart illustrating the relative frequency with which I saw different categories of ads. Technology, business, and automative ads dominated.</i></p><p>I also had a fair number of different “Automotive” related ads showing up, both for cars as well as car insurance. I would broadly consider this category to be irrelevant to me, as I do not own a car nor want to own one. Showing car insurance ads to someone without a car does not seem to match the aspirational marketing maxim of “right person at the right time.”</p><h2>How many ads were relevant?</h2><p>Lastly, I sat down and reviewed the different unique ads I saw and labeled them as ‘relevant/useful’ or ‘not relevant’. This was obviously a very subjective exercise but an important one nonetheless. Irrelevant ads hurt user’s digital experience and they waste advertisers’ time and money. Entire industries have been built on personal data collection and the promise of marketing personalization, so this exercise was meant to serve as a very rough proxy for the success of that vision.</p><p>When labeling ads as ‘relevant’, I tried to be fairly open minded and include things that I’m not in the market for right now, but might be at some point in the next few years, such as replacement running shoes. I also included public awareness ads, such as those for coronavirus.gov or the public health initiative alonetogether.com. Of the 397 unique advertisers whose ads I saw (including multiple different products or ad copies), I decided 32 of them were relevant. The majority of these were for technology services, such as the cloud software monitoring company sonraisecurity.com, news related items (like a Bloomberg subscription or Politico sponsored articles), or coupon services. I got several ads for products I already purchase, such as TDAmeritrade’s brokerage services or Cloud Guru’s online tech education service. However, ads for things like <a href="http://covance.com/">Convance’s</a> contract clinical trial services, car insurance, coding bootcamps, or <a href="https://ncgmarketing.com/">digital marketing for attorneys</a> were not things I would ever need.</p><p>I saw these 32 ‘relevant’ ads a total of 666 times (auspicious, I know), and saw irrelevant ads 4,309 times. Excluding that one problematic website that served me thousands of LendingTree and other ads, reduces the irrelevant ads frequency total to 1867, or 74%.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on this small sample size analysis and accounting for the outlier of one website, I saw ~85 Google display ads per day. The majority of them (74%) were not relevant to me, and in most cases I did not have a way to opt-out of seeing them any more. I did get some ads from companies that were offering relevant products or services that I looked into further; some of these companies paid for more than 100 impressions to grab my attention, which underscores how some marketing strategies espouse a high number of touchpoints to interest a customer.</p><p>The example of LendingTree’s ad barrage, both on that one particularly problematic website, as well as on other sites, highlights how a lack of opt-out mechanisms and frequency capping can hurt consumers, and perhaps advertisers as well.</p><h2>Take away points</h2><ul><li>The proportion of ads shown to users that are relevant can be as low as 25%, probably even lower</li><li>A small number of advertisers can account for a disproportionately large portion of ad content served to users</li><li>Users are often not given any way to opt-out of irrelevant ads, excepting by installing ad blockers</li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-9/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. In this thrilling new update, we
will learn a little bit more about x86-64 instruction encoding instead of
allocating more interesting things on the heap or adding procedure calls.</p>

<p>I am writing this interlude because I changed one register in my compiler code
(<code>kRbp</code> to <code>kRsp</code>) and all hell broke loose — the resulting program was
crashing, <code>rasm2</code>/Cutter were decoding wacky instructions when fed my binary,
etc. Over the span of two very interesting but very frustrating hours, I
learned why I had these problems and how to resolve them. You should learn,
too.</p>

<h3 id="state-of-the-instruction-encoder">State of the instruction encoder</h3>

<p>Recall that I introduced at least 10 functions that looked vaguely like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc7</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>src</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions all purport to encode x86-64 instructions. They do, most of the
time, but they do not tell the whole story. This function is supposed to encode
an instruction of the form <code>mov reg64, imm32</code>. How does it do it? I don’t know!</p>

<p>They have all these magic numbers in them! What is a <code>kRexPrefix</code>? Well, it’s
<code>0x48</code>. Does that mean anything to us? No! It gets worse. What are <code>0xc7</code> and
<code>0xc0</code> doing there? Why are we adding <code>dst</code> to <code>0xc0</code>? Before this debugging
and reading extravaganza, I could not have told you. Remember how somewhere in
a previous post I mentioned I was getting these hex bytes from reading the
compiled output on the Compiler Explorer? Yeah.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is not a robust development strategy, at least with
x86-64. It might be okay for some more regular or predictable instruction sets,
but not this one.</p>

<h3 id="big-scary-documentation">Big scary documentation</h3>

<p>So where do we go from here? How do we find out how to take these mystical
hexes and incantations to something that better maps to the hardware? Well, we
once again drag <a href="https://tchebb.me/">Tom</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> into a debugging session and pull
out the big ol’ Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Software Developer Manual</a>.</p>

<p>This is an enormous 26MB, 5000 page manual comprised of four volumes. It’s
<em>very intimidating</em>. This is exactly why I didn’t want to pull it out earlier
and do this properly from the beginning… but here we are, eventually needing
to do it properly.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to understand all of this manual, nor will this post be a
guide to the manual. I will just explain what sections and diagrams I found
useful in understanding how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I only ever opened Volume 2, the instruction set reference. In that honking
2300 page volume are descriptions of every Intel x86-64 instruction and how
they are encoded. The instructions are listed alphabetically and split into
sections based on the first letter of each instruction name.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Chapter 3, specifically at the MOV instruction on page
&nbsp; 1209. For those following along who do not want to download a massive
PDF, this <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html">website</a> has a bunch
of the same data in HTML form. Here’s the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mov">page for
MOV</a>.</p>

<p>This page has every variant of MOV instruction. There are other instructions
begin with MOV, like MOVAPD, MOVAPS, etc, but they are different enough that
they are different instructions.</p>

<p>It has six columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Opcode</em>, which describes the layout of the bytes in the instruction stream.
This describes how we’ll encode instructions.</li>
  <li><em>Instruction</em>, which gives a text-assembly-esque representation of the
instruction. This is useful for figuring out which one we actually want to
encode.</li>
  <li><em>Op/En</em>, which stands for “Operand Encoding” and as far as I can tell
describes the operand order with a symbol that is explained further in the
“Instruction Operand Encoding” table on the following page.</li>
  <li><em>64-Bit Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in 64-bit mode
(“Valid”) or not (something else, I guess).</li>
  <li><em>Compat/Leg Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in some
other mode, which I imagine is 32-bit mode or 16-bit mode. I don’t know. But
it’s not relevant for us.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>, which provides a “plain English” description of the opcode,
for some definition of the words “plain” and “English”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other instructions have slightly different table layouts, so you’ll have to
work out what the other columns mean.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of some rows from the table, with HTML courtesy of Felix
Cloutier’s aforementioned web docs:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Opcode</th>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Op/En</th>
<th>64-Bit Mode</th>
<th>Compat/Leg Mode</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8,r8</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX + 88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8</em><sup>***,</sup><em>r8</em><sup>***</sup></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m16,r16</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r16</em> to <em>r/m16.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32,r32</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX.W + C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m64, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32 sign extended to 64-bits</em> to <em>r/m64.</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If you take a look at the last entry in the table, you’ll see <code>REX.W + C7 /0
id</code>. Does that look familiar? Maybe, if you squint a little?</p>

<p>It turns out, that’s the description for encoding the instruction we originally
wanted, and had a bad encoder for. Let’s try and figure out how to use this to
make our encoder better. In order to do that, we’ll need to first understand a
general layout for Intel instructions.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encoding-big-picture">Instruction encoding, big picture</h3>

<p>All Intel x86-64 instructions follow this general format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>optional</em> instruction prefix (1 byte)</li>
  <li>opcode (1, 2, or 3 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Mod-Reg/Opcode-R/M, also known as ModR/M (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Scale-Index-Base, also known as SIB (1 byte)</li>
  <li>displacement (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
  <li>immediate data (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this information at the very beginning of Volume 2, Chapter 2 (page
527) in a section called “Instruction format for protected mode, real-address
mode, and virtual-8086 mode”.</p>

<p>You, like me, may be wondering about the difference between “optional”, “if
required”, and “…, or none”. I have no explanation, sorry.</p>

<p>I’m going to briefly explain each component here, followed up with a
piece-by-piece dissection of the particular MOV instruction we want, so we get
some hands-on practice.</p>

<h4 id="instruction-prefixes">Instruction prefixes</h4>

<p>There are a couple kind of instruction prefixes, like REX (Section 2.2.1) and
VEX (Section 2.3). We’re going to focus on REX prefixes, since they are needed
for many (most?) x86-64 instructions, and we’re not emitting vector
instructions.</p>

<p>The REX prefixes are used to indicate that an instruction, which might normally
refer to a 32-bit register, should instead refer to a 64-bit register. Also
some other things but we’re mostly concerned with register sizes.</p>

<h4 id="opcode">Opcode</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.2 (page 529) for a brief explanation of opcodes. The
gist is that the opcode is the <em>meat</em> of the instruction. It’s what makes a MOV
a MOV and not a HALT. The other fields all modify the meaning given by this
field.</p>

<h4 id="modrm-and-sib">ModR/M and SIB</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.3 (page 529) for a brief explanation of ModR/M and
SIB bytes. The gist is that they encode what register sources and destinations
to use.</p>

<h4 id="displacement-and-immediates">Displacement and immediates</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.4 (page 529) for a brief explanation of displacement
and immediate bytes. The gist is that they encode literal numbers used in the
instructions that don’t encode registers or anything.</p>

<p>If you’re confused, that’s okay. It should maybe get clearer once we get our
hands dirty. Reading all of this information in a vacuum is moderately useless
if it’s your first time dealing with assembly like this, but I included this
section first to help explain how to use the reference.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-piece-by-piece">Encoding, piece by piece</h3>

<p>Got all that? Maybe? No? Yeah, me neither. But let’s forge ahead anyway. Here’s
the instruction we’re going to encode: <code>REX.W + C7 /0 id</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rexw">REX.W</h4>

<p>First, let’s figure out <code>REX.W</code>. According to Section 2.2.1, which explains REX
prefixes in some detail, there are a couple of different prefixes. There’s a
helpful table (Table 2-4, page 535) documenting them. Here’s a bit diagram with
the same information:</p>

<p>In English, and zero-indexed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bits 7-4 are always <code>0b0100</code>.</li>
  <li>Bit 3 is the W prefix. If it’s 1, it means the operands are 64 bits. If it’s
0, “operand size [is] determined by CS.D”. Not sure what that means.</li>
  <li>Bits 2, 1, and 0 are other types of REX prefixes that we may not end up
using, so I am omitting them here. Please read further in the manual if you
are curious!</li>
</ul>

<p>This MOV instruction calls for REX.W, which means this byte will look like
<code>0b01001000</code>, also known as our friend <code>0x48</code>. Mystery number one, solved!</p>

<h4 id="c7">C7</h4>

<p>This is a hexadecimal literal <code>0xc7</code>. It is the <em>opcode</em>. There are a couple of
other entries with the opcode <code>C7</code>, modified by other bytes in the instruction
(ModR/M, SIB, REX, …). Write it to the instruction stream. Mystery number
two, solved!</p>

<h4 id="0">/0</h4>

<p>There’s a snippet in Section 2.1.5 that explains this notation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the Reg/Opcode
field may be used as an opcode extension. This use is represented by the
sixth row in the tables (labeled “/digit (Opcode)”). Note that values in row
six are represented in decimal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little confusing because this operation clearly <em>does</em> have a second
operand, denoted by the “MI” in the table, which shows Operand 1 being
<code>ModRM:r/m (w)</code> and Operand 2 being <code>imm8/16/32/64</code>. I think it’s because it
doesn’t have a second <em>register</em> operand that this space is free — the
immediate is in a different place in the instruction.</p>

<p>In any case, this means that we have to make sure to put decimal <code>0</code> in the
<code>reg</code> part of the ModR/M byte. We’ll see what the ModR/M byte looks like in
greater detail shortly.</p>

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

<p><em>id</em> refers to an immediate <em>double word</em> (32 bits). It’s called a <em>double</em>
word because, a word (<em>iw</em>) is 16 bits. In increasing order of size, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ib</em>, byte (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>iw</em>, word (2 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>id</em>, double word (4 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>io</em>, quad word (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we have to write our 32-bit value out to the instruction stream.
These notations and encodings are explained further in Section 3.1.1.1 (page
596).</p>

<p>Overall, that means that this instruction will have the …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>I come across questions on how to get started in programming often. People are hungry to learn, but don’t know where to start or which path to take. This is made even more difficult these days due to a lot of different areas that exist, such as web development, mobile software development, game development etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we live at a time when tutorials and lessons are abundant, a lot of it can feel overwhelming. What you need is a roadmap to navigate the topics. You want a structure to guide you in your learning. A lot of coding bootcamps follow an approach similar to a college curriculum. Working through these curriculums is frustrating because you don’t feel like you are learning anything substantial quickly enough. College curriculum is great if your goal is to get a certificate or a degree. They are not great if your goal is to learn the practical skills of software engineering.</p>



<p>Following is a roadmap that I have put together to help you guide yourself in learning how to program. Your mileage with this will depend on your current experience with coding. These days though, I expect a lot of people to have had some exposure to very basic coding concepts such as loops, if statements etc. Spending any more time on these concepts may not be worthwhile. What you want is a road map that gets you on your way to building things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here it is, my recommended roadmap for learning how to build software:</p>



<h2>1. Start with Web Development</h2>



<p>As I had mentioned, there are many different areas of software development that you could focus on. I recommend starting with Web Development because it has the quickest feedback loop. This will help you improve fast and learn various concepts quickly. Principles learnt here can then be applied to other areas that you may be interested in such as mobile app development or game development.</p>



<p>When learning web app programming, you will be required to pick up HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are core languages for building web apps. But what you want to spend more time and focus on is the backend server system. The backend systems are responsible for providing the data APIs that support your application. Principles that you learn building good backend systems will provide you with a strong software engineering foundation.</p>



<p>For the backend, you will primarily work with either PHP, Python, Java or Ruby. Pick any one that you feel comfortable with. I recommend Python or Ruby to start.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Prioritize building an end-to-end application first</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key principles for effective learning is to focus on depth first. Instead of learning a lot of concepts across the breadth of the topics, I recommend going deep into one specific area. In this case, I suggest focusing on building a simple end-to-end application first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a general idea of what it is like to build something from scratch. More importantly, you will feel great having a built a working app. The feeling of satisfaction from the progress will motivate and propel you forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you are ready to unpack and dive deeper into various aspects of what you have built. </p>











<h2><strong>3. Dive deep into the principles of software architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have built an end-to-end app you will find that learning a couple of frameworks and libraries will be enough to keep you going. Most coding bootcamps stop here. But this stops short of diving into the richer and more rewarding world of software engineering. </p>



<p>I recommend spending time learning software design principles, object oriented programming and various systems architecture patterns. You will learn the details of how to cleanly and effectively work with databases, how to structure your code to enable more complex systems, different design patterns and architectures. </p>



<p>Software architecture&nbsp;principles&nbsp;are timeless and will support you throughout your entire career. </p>



<p>Some great books I can recommend here are:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321127420&amp;linkId=4962a37ba12a94696993ef4f54eca9fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882&amp;linkId=20953e9f7d1dd550a5b402f355cfc2a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code</a></p>



<h2><strong>4. Data structure and&nbsp;algorithms are super important</strong></h2>



<p>The importance of algorithms in software engineering can be surprisingly controversial. This is perhaps due to Silicon Valley tech companies relying on them in the interview process. It’s true that many professional software developers never look back at the algorithms that they vaguely learn in college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s unfortunate. The reality is that deep knowledge of algorithms, just like software architecture are foundational requirements if you want to excel as a software engineer at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Check out the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201657880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201657880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;linkId=0eb37d6439098ac088b44d65937d4143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Pearls</a> for some great practical thinking on this).<br></p>



<hr>



<p><strong><br></strong>I hope this roadmap gives you some sense of the various aspects that you can focus on to learn programming and launch a career in software engineering. I have not provided a time estimate here since your progress will vary. Learning something new and complex takes time. If you stick with it, a rewarding career is waiting for you on the other side.</p>
